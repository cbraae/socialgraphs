{"sections":[{"title":"Kara","level":1,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Kara is Doug's wife. She and Doug play a game of tennis with Monica and Chandler Bing, but regrets it when Monica exhausts, irritates and bemuses them both with her ridiculously overly-competitive attitude. She and Doug were also mentioned to have once met Joey, who is implied to have greatly irritated and drove them and the rest of Doug's employees crazy, as Chandler stated he believed that Monica, who they all initially took a liking to after he first introduced her to them, \"repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey.\" Doug at one point makes fun of how weak she sets her coffee, and apparently isn't faithful to her, as Chandler claimed at one point that he once bumped into Doug at a strip club. In \"The One With Ross's Step Forward\" it is revealed that she and Doug have now divorced."}],"images":[]}]}
