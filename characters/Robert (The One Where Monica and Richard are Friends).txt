Ross, Joey and Rachel notice this as well and also Phoebe, who has a difficult time coping with it. She hastily buys him stretchy pants and, although Robert is grateful, he confesses that he doesn't like tight pants. Eventually, Phoebe and Robert sit down together and Phoebe tries to explain, but Robert interrupts at the first words, thinking that she wants to break-up with him. He then complains, obliviously letting out jokes about his problem: \"is it something I'm putting out there?\" and, \"is it me? Or am I just nuts?''\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Phoebe, lost for words, doesn't know what to say until Gunther crudely points out, \"Hey buddy, this is a family place.
