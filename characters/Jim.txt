{"sections":[{"title":"Jim","level":1,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Jim Nelson was seen in the episode \"The One With The Tea Leaves\" as Phoebe's date. They met by seeing each other everywhere while out on their errands and eventually he decided to ask Phoebe out on a date, despite being slightly bemused when she misunderstood the pretty obvious meaning of a remark he made. On the date, Jim\u00a0fell away from his initially polite and friendly demeanor and, seemingly just to amuse himself, started\u00a0making highly inappropriate and rude\u00a0vile\u00a0comments which Phoebe found both\u00a0disturbing and intimidating. He also claimed, most likely lying in yet another\u00a0attempt to intimidate her, that he wrote \"erotic novels for children\" which were \"wildly unpopular\". Phoebe later referred to him as the \"rude guy\"."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Jim appears to be\u00a0a nasty, unpleasant, rather manipulative and perhaps misogynistic\u00a0individual\u00a0who\u00a0could possibly be considered an antagonist, as he in a way bullied Phoebe on the date, so much so that for the rest of the episode she avoided going to the coffee shop and all the other places she had seen him while out on her errands in order to avoid encountering him again.\u00a0Oddly enough however, she\u00a0seemed comfortable going to the coffee shop without having to worry about him in later episodes. The reason for this is unknown, but it's possible that her friends may have confronted Jim and intimidated\u00a0the disturbing bully\u00a0into leaving Phoebe alone (as Joey, Chandler and Ross had vowed to give a man who had cheated on her the \"butt kicking of a lifetime\" in an earlier episode)."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Apparently, he was based on a real life boyfriend of one of the creators."}],"images":[]}]}
