She and her husband share a semi-private labor room with Rachel and Ross. Julie is pregnant with her third child, Jaime and wants to share the experience with Ross and Rachel, but both her and her husband end up creeping them out. Her husband inappropriately takes photos of Rachel while she is having contractions and describes Julie\u2019s cervix to Ross. Julie then suggests that Ross feel Rachel\u2019s cervix and then her own to compare. Not long after this, Julie is transferred to the delivery room, but before going, she shows Rachel how \"Jaime is crowning away.\u201d After they leave, Ross refers to them as \u201cThe Disgustingtons.\""}],"images":[]}]}
