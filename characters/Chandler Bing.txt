He frequently complains about his dislike of his job, and quits in\u00a0Season 9, finding\u00a0employment as a Junior Copywriter in an advertising agency."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chandler is Ross Geller's best friend\u00a0throughout and since college. He met Ross's sister\u00a0Monica Geller and her friend Rachel Green while celebrating Thanksgiving 1987 at the Geller family residence during his first year\u00a0at college. He later moved to apartment #19 in New York City, across the hall from Monica. At some point during this time, Phoebe Buffay\u00a0moved in with Monica and Kip\u00a0became Chandler's roommate. Kip and\u00a0Monica dated for a while, but later broke up, and could no longer stand to be in the same room as each other. Chandler's next roommate, Joey Tribbiani, completed the group of friends. Chandler lived with Joey until season 6, when he moved in with Monica, whom he had been dating for a year."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chandler is the wealthiest friend\u00a0because he has been saving money from his job for the last six years. He becomes angry when\u00a0Monica expects him to spend his savings on her dream wedding, convincing her that they should save the money for their life after the wedding, which Monica agrees to."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Because of the Thursday night line-up that led with Friends, Thanksgiving was always an important episode for the series. Chandler's most vivid memory of Thanksgiving is when he was nine years old when his mother and father told him that they were getting divorced so his father could run off with the house-boy. Because of this, Chandler refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving in the traditional way. This includes a ban on all Thanksgiving food, as he insists that it's not as good after seeing a Thanksgiving dinner in reverse. His Thanksgiving dinner consists of tomato soup, grilled cheese sandwiches, and a family-size bag of Funyuns. Several Thanksgiving episodes include retellings of this backstory of Chandler's home life and his hatred of the holiday. Joey goes so far as to say, \"It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!\" Later on, perhaps thanks to his more positive view of family events due to his relationship with Monica, he accepts Thanksgiving. He still refuses to eat the actual food, even when dining with his friends, eating chicken instead of turkey and other things of that nature."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chandler visits the Geller household for Thanksgiving again in 1988, slightly dismissed by Judy, Ross and Monica's mother, because he does not eat any Thanksgiving food.\u00a0While attempting to get back at Chandler for calling her fat the previous year, Monica accidentally dropped a knife through Chandler's wicker shoes. Chandler lost most of the pinkie toe on his right foot because it couldn't be replaced, due to the fact that Monica accidentally brought a baby carrot to the hospital instead of the toe. This incident led Ross to call Chandler Sir Limps-a-Lot. Chandler is not aware that it was Monica's revenge-gone-bad that caused him to lose his toe until she tells him during Thanksgiving dinner (\"The One With All The Thanksgivings\")."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Monica\u00a0reveals that Chandler has a third nipple, which Chandler describes as a nubbin after she learns that Chandler told Phoebe about her having sex\u00a0with Fun Bobby on the balcony. The friends are amused at the secret, and they tease Chandler about it. Finally, Chandler has the nubbin surgically removed after Ginger,\u00a0a would-be lover, is repulsed by it."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chandler was a bed-wetter as a child. While supporting Rachel during her parents' divorce, he jokingly recommends the, \"carefully regimented program of denial ... and, and wetting the bed,\" which he himself relied on as a child (\"The One With The Two Parties\")."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Throughout the run of the show, Chandler comments how much he dislikes physical exercise. However, he is often seen enjoying Knicks games with Joey and Ross. He also enjoys watching ice hockey, football, and baseball. He even enjoys racquetball. It's often alluded that Chandler doesn't really enjoy these things; he just wants to seem like one of the guys. In Season 10, it is revealed that he once tried out for his high school figure-skating team, much to the amusement of Phoebe and Ross.\u00a0On Thanksgiving, he enters the room saying he wants to watch football. Phoebe responds, \"It's okay. Ross and Joey aren't here. You can watch the parade if you want.\" Chandler demonstrates excellent tennis skills and ping pong skills, the latter he hides from Monica due to her childish competitiveness."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Although it became less noticeable during the course of the show, Chandler has the habit of accenting the wrong words in his sentences. This leads to his friends and colleagues imitating his speech pattern."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Personality","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Though Chandler never lets up by using sarcasm as a defense, he had a tendency to come off as needy and makes bad first impressions as said by Phoebe with his constant joke-making and brash demeanor. Despite this emotional immaturity, Chandler is the most financially secure of his friends."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chandler is brash, zany and estranged from both of his parents. He suffers from commitment issues, brought on by growing up in a broken home with no idea of what a stable marriage looks like, can be neurotic and extremely defensive with humor as his shield but his sense of humor is generally unsophisticated, to the point during an interview when his boss told him he'd have \"extra duties on his hand\" he had to stop himself from laughing. Chandler also associates everything that links to his parents' divorce in a negative light, specifically Thanksgiving where his parents reveal their separation over turkey where his father plans to run away with the busboy. This also associates with his mistrust of people in adult relationships. Becoming extremely paranoid when his girlfriend, Kathy (who was an actress) shared a sex scene with her co-star prompting a big fight between the two. Ironically it was Chandler's own paranoia that drove Kathy to have an affair with the same person."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"His commitment issues are not only a running gag in the series but as well with his friends who use it as an excuse to mock him. In \"The One With The Lesbian Wedding\", when asked who of the group will get married last they all pointed at Chandler. This could either be a joke, a ribbing on his commitment-phobia or him being the least desirable of the group. Even when he was a happily married man, Chandler still retained some of his paranoia when it was revealed that their surrogate mother was having twins, he instantly panicked and suggested keeping only one. When he discovered they were both male and females however he was overjoyed."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Similar to Phoebe, Chandler is relatively comfortable with complementing looks of the same gender however he is quite humiliated by his effeminate nature and is a profound heterosexual whereas Phoebe has been hinted to be bisexual. It's revealed Joey is who he would go out with and when Phoebe saw her \"perfect guy\" at Central Perk after reading tea leaves, Chandler remarks \"oh my God, that guy was looking at you and he is so cute\" in a high-pitched voice. He also began acting extremely effeminately when he was listening to a cassette tape for women to stop him from smoking. Because of this Chandler is normally dominated by his ballsy and forward spouse, Monica and rarely ever \"wins\" in a fight with her, however, Chandler does have bursts of confidence. When Monica wanted to use his nest egg to pay for their big wedding he firmly put his foot down, which greatly impressed Phoebe who normally points Chandler out for his effeminate nature, claiming \"Money, and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with\"."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chandler also shares a lot of traits with Mister Heckles, Monica\u00a0and Rachel's neighbor. They are both extremely picky with women (planning to break up with one simply because her head was too big), were voted class clown in high school, played the clarinet and Chandler even did his signature pound the ceiling with a broom when Monica and Rachel were making too much noise."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Probably because of his entire childhood of being humiliated, Chandler would much prefer to follow through on an insane lie rather than admit to the truth and create an embarrassing situation or an actual confrontation. Lacking the nerve to break up with Janice after he rekindled their romance he tells her he is moving to Yemen and actually does when she only agreed to leave the airport after she saw his plane depart, causing him financial loss. This was further shown when he destroyed his own office when an enraged colleague (who had been calling Chandler 'Toby') got word that \"Chandler Bing\" stopped him from moving upward and he didn't want to admit that he mistook his name for Toby and never corrected him on it."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Relationships","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chandler started out as the one who had the most problems with commitment, He began his relationship with Monica as early as Season 5 (since Season 4's finale was actually a fling for both characters); moved on to the proposal in Season 6; married her in Season 7; and adopted twins Jack\u00a0and Erica\u00a0Bing in the last episode of Season 10. In \"The One With The Lesbian Wedding\", everyone thinks that Chandler will be last for them to get married. This ends up being quite ironic as he is the first Friend to have a committed marriage that doesn't end in divorce, and none of the others have a marriage again until Season 10 when Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Monica Geller","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Going by his behavior in the seasons prior to him becoming involved with Monica, it is possible that Chandler has been interested in her for years.

She, however, laughs at the idea and for the first four seasons and before the show started they are\u00a0portrayed merely\u00a0as close friends. They've seen to depend on each other a great deal as Monica\u00a0helped him lose weight (Season 2), reassured him that\u00a0he wouldn't die alone\u00a0(\"The One Where Heckles Dies\"), comforted him about his crush on Kathy and\u00a0gave him sex advice in Season 4. Chandler also apparently told her about his third nipple, and he was the only one who knew that it was her underwear on the telegraph pole outside the apartment. Chandler also comforts Monica when she's upset, like when she discovered that Phoebe moved out or when she was upset about not having a child or a boyfriend in Season 3."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Things change for Chandler and Monica in London when they sleep together (season 4). Monica becomes depressed when her mother says that she'll never get married, and she is pushed over the edge when a drunken man mistakes her for Ross's mother.

When Chandler tries to cheer her up by telling her he thinks she was the most beautiful woman in the room at the rehearsal dinner - that she is, in fact, the most beautiful woman in most rooms, Monica throws herself at him and they end up spending the night together. The next day, initially things are quite awkward between them. When they meet up at the wedding they agree that sleeping together was a stupid thing to do, but that's not enough to keep them from agreeing to meet up again that night. They say that they will stop once they leave London, but that fails and they begin a relationship. Chandler refers to the night as the most romantic night of his life. It seems likely that Chandler already had strong romantic feelings for Monica by the time their first night together was over, and his mild interest in her, mentioned above, became a serious romantic connection due to the confirmation of Monica's feelings."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"They try to keep their relationship secret from their other friends, who eventually found out (\"The One Where Everybody Finds Out\"). The first to find out is Joey when he discovers through identical aspects of Monica and Chandler's 'work trips' in \"The One With The Kips\" that they were actually away together. Then Rachel overhears a telephone conversation between the two containing sexual innuendos. (Monica denies this when she is confronted by Rachel, insisting that she was referring to Chandler as \"Mr. Bigot\" and not, \"Mr. Big ...\", going on to describe him jokingly as a racist).
