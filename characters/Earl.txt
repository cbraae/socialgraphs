She then offers some \"similarities\" between Earl and her mom Lily (though they weren't actually similarities so much as they were stretched truth and lies). Phoebe even tells Earl that her mom's name was Pearl (puh-earl). Earl appears to absorb Phoebe's words when she tells him that he doesn't need any of his uncaring co-workers to pay attention to him-but when he loudly announces this to them all and they ignore him completely, not even looking at him, he can't help but express to Phoebe that he'd like a little bit of attention from them. He is never seen again after this, but considering his\u00a0apparent newfound friendship with Phoebe, which would presumably\u00a0have diminished the feelings of loneliness that drove him crazy and caused him to feel suicidal,\u00a0it is safe to assume that she was successful in her attempts to convince him not to kill himself."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Trivia","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Jason Alexander made an appearance in an episode of Friends.
