They share a kiss, and she shows the guys a poem he wrote when he was with her called The Empty Vase. Phoebe interprets the poem as Julio using the empty vase of the title as a metaphor to express contempt for Monica; \"My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I\u2019ve touched you, you seem emptier still\"."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"An outraged Monica remonstrates with him, but Julio explains that Phoebe's interpretation is wrong. Just as she's about to apologize, Julio explains that The Empty Vase is about all women - \"well, all American women\". Monica dumps Julio and sends a barber shop quartet to the diner to sing him an insulting break up song - \"Mister Pretentious, you think there\u2019s no one finer, but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner. You\u2019re no God's gift to women, that\u2019s all in your headdddd.
