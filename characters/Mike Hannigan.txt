An example of their shared childlike attitude is clear in \"The One with Princess Consuela\" when Mike changes his name to Crap Bag as a retort to Phoebe's name change. His childishness is also apparent in his and Phoebe's wedding, when he decides that his dog should be one of the groomsmen. We learn from the first time we meet Mike that, like his wife, he is quite musical as he explains (on Joey's poorly arranged blind date) that he recently left his job as an attorney to pursue his ideal career as a pianist."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Family","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Mike first confesses his love for Phoebe in front of his parents, Theodore and Bitsy, after they voice their concerns about their son's choice of partner in \"The One With Ross's Inappropriate Song\".

Mike then learns that Phoebe's first love, David, is planning to propose to her whilst they are in Barbados for Ross' key-notes speech; he then changes his mind about marriage and proposes to Phoebe before David can. This proposal was rejected, as Phoebe only wanted to know that marriage was a possibility, and she and Mike become a couple again. They become officially engaged in \"The One Where Rachel's Sister Baby-Sits\". In the final season, the two are married in the street outside the Central Perk coffeehouse, with Monica as maid of honor, Rachel as a bridesmaid, Joey officiating (he was ordained over the internet for Monica and Chandler's wedding), Chandler giving Phoebe away and Ross holding Mike's beloved but smelly childhood dog as a groomsman. In the series finale, Mike and Phoebe, after seeing Jack and Erica for the first time, discuss having children. Phoebe says she wants multiple kids by exclaiming; \"One?! How about a whole bunch! Ooh ooh, we teach them to sing and we can be like the Von Trapp Family! Only without the Nazis.

Unfortunately, he commits the same infraction to score the winning point of the second game, but it is never called.
