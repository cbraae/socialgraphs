He is portrayed by David Schwimmer."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Personality","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"While he is smart, polite, caring, thoughtful and kind, Ross is often clumsy and socially awkward - taking the characteristics of the stereotypical \"loser nerd\". He is sometimes shown to have a good sense of humor. He is the only member of the group of friends with a doctorate and, as such, can be arrogant. In most cases, his arrogance backfires or gets the best of him. In later seasons, due to his two failed marriages and ruined life, he starts developing breathtaking anger management issues and also shown to easily be irritated, often breaking into angry outbursts over minor things, even showing signs of sociopathic behavior. For example, in The One With Ross's Sandwich, Ross is fired from the museum after yelling at his boss for eating his sandwich. This behavior leads to him taking on a more antagonistic role in most episodes in the later seasons."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ross seems to have a childlike need to always be right. Such as in The One Where Heckles Dies when he finds out that Phoebe doesn't believe in evolution. Shocked by this, he spends the rest of the episode pestering her and trying to get her to believe in evolution. He is angered when Phoebe asks him why he has this need for everyone to always agree with him. He seems to find people irrational if they won't conform to his point-of-view."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ross' childishness was more emphasized and apparent at the beginning of his and Rachel's relationship in which he began spending (if possible) even more time at Monica's apartment and their relationship reverted back to when they were teenagers which in the same episode Monica reveals she hated him during their youth. However, this isn't unique to one particular episode and they have at times shown traits of typical sibling relationships even at their adult age throughout the series; rash outbursts, competitiveness, and physical confrontations are examples of such. Perhaps the cause of his childlikeness is his parents. As he was the favored and academically gifted child who received the more credit and praise in comparison to Monica, he can't always be blamed for his sometimes enlarged ego. Also, he doesn't respond well when his parents don't give him the acknowledgment they always do and was clearly distraught over Jack's Porsche being given to Monica as a peace offering for ruining her childhood memories claiming that he was a \"medical marvel.\" Ross is also perfectly comfortable lying to his parents especially if it wouldn't tarnish the extremely high mantle they placed him on his entire life. He framed Chandler for making him smoke marijuana in college and when this was revealed in \"The One Where Ross Got High\", he refused to tell Jack and Judy despite it being years and he had not done so since and once considered informing them in a letter simply out of sheer cowardice."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ross, despite being socially awkward, dates many women throughout the series. Due to his unsuccessful marriage to Carol Willick, he started to develop fierce amounts of paranoia and insecurities when it comes to women. Monica states that before Carol left Ross for Susan, he was never paranoid or jealous... even though it was obvious to everyone except him that all his previous girlfriends were cheating on him. Due to this, he does not seem to even trust Rachel to be faithful to him and is often prone to jealousy and is quick to suspect his girlfriend's of cheating on him. Most of his dates are disrupted or completely ruined once his paranoia or geekiness get the best of him."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"These paranoias and insecurities often causes conflict in his relationships; for example, when Rachel began spending a lot of time with a co-worker of hers named Mark Robinson, out of paranoia he came to mistakenly suspect that she was having an affair, when in reality she only ever considered her relationship with Mark to be platonic. She eventually becomes so fed up with Ross's jealousy that she announces that she wants to take a break from their relationship. When Ross later tries to reconcile with her by phoning her at her apartment, he overhears Mark's voice in the background; in reality Mark had come to comfort her as a friend after hearing she was upset after calling her after her fight with Ross, but once again out of paranoia Ross mistakenly thinks he is there to have sex with her and angrily hangs up. Convinced now that his suspicions about her affair with Mark were right and his relationship with her is over, a depressed Ross gets drunk and the sum of the alcohol, his emotional vulnerability and a promiscuous woman named Chloe results in him choosing to have sex with her. He does not learn he had been mistaken in thinking Rachel had sex with Mark until the following morning when he hears a message Rachel left on his answering machine, telling him she wants to work on the relationship. The pair get back together only to break up again when Rachel discovers Ross's indiscretion with Chloe."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ross's jealousy also becomes apparent during his relationship with Emily Waltham, when he fears that she is growing too close to Carol's lesbian partner, Susan Bunch. His jealous streak rears its ugly head again when he dates his student, Elizabeth Stevens, and ultimately accompanies her on her spring break vacation to ensure she does not stray."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Despite being financially secure, Ross is notoriously cheap. He gets his hair cut at the bargain chain Super Cuts; steals toiletries and other amenities from hotels and refuses to tip anyone. He is often mocked by his friends about his annoying habits of correcting people's grammar and avoiding straightforward dialogue when nervous."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"He tries to convince his friends to act for the best in difficult situations even though such actions may be difficult to carry out. In season 2, he encourages Joey to audition for Another World after being fired from Days of Our Lives, despite Joey's refusal to present himself for a two-line part of a secondary character. In season 7, he buys Phoebe the bike of her dreams but threatens to take it away from her because of her reluctance to learn how to ride it. When he discovers that Joey has a crush on Rachel, he tells him to tell her about it and go for it instead of hiding it ... even though he has problems with the idea of Joey and Rachel.

By the later seasons, Ross himself refers to Joey as his best friend, while Joey goes so far as to initially feel reluctant of being in a relationship with Rachel due to Ross' potential (and eventually factual) disapproval, although the latter eventually agrees to deal with it for Joey since it had been so long since Rachel and Ross were together at that point. Regardless, the two are supportive of each other and frequently attempt to help each other with whatever problem comes, with Joey especially providing aid when it comes to relationship advice.

Ross and Will are quite friendly to each other despite the time apart but are at odds when Will becomes hostile towards Rachel. Will gets upset when he learns that Ross went out with Rachel when he and the former had a pact with the club because it had the word \"eternity\" in it. When the two men reveal the rumor they made about Rachel being a hermaphrodite and Rachel becomes tearful and upset, Ross and Will smile happily, but when Rachel stormed out, Ross felt guilty at his actions while Will continues smiling. Later, when Rachel tells everyone about Ross making out with the high-school librarian, Ross gets furious and soon decides to get back in the club and high-fives Will. Will then becomes shocked to learn that Ross got Rachel pregnant but proud that they're not getting married. He tries to high-five Ross again, but Ross ignores it.
