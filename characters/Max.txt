{"sections":[{"title":"Max","level":1,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Max is a scientist who appears in The One With The Monkey. He is the colleague of David, Phoebe's on-and-off love interest, and he seems to possess a dislike for Phoebe. He is rather priggish and excited about David leaving Phoebe when they get a grant and plan to go to Minsk. David refuses to go, unable to leave Phoebe, which increases Max's dislike for her. He decides to go to Minsk without David, which David can't cope with and so he ends up going with him. Max also calls Phoebe \"Yoko\" at one point, a reference to John Lennons wife Yoko Ono whom some blame for The Beatles splitting up."}],"images":[]}]}
