{"sections":[{"title":"Jack Geller","level":1,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Jack Geller is the father of Ross Geller and Monica Geller and husband to Judy Geller. He is best known for his ill-timed, inappropriate comments, such as addressing Emily's father while in London as a \"thieving, would-be-speaking-German-if-it-weren't-for-us, cheap little man\". He often tries to get himself out of these things using the line 'I'm just saying...' He led his in-laws to believe that he's an attorney, although his line of work was revealed to be in the Military. He secretly smoked cigarettes, claiming that the cigarettes Ross found around the house were Judy's. His inappropriate comments often were based on sexual themes, such as when he started discussing Monica and Chandler's sexual strategies for getting pregnant."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Although both Jack and Judy were criticized for favoring Ross over Monica, Jack was the more sympathetic of the two. He constantly referred to Monica as Harmonica. When Monica broke up with serious boyfriend Richard Burke, he consoled her, although he had previously disapproved of her dating his long-time best friend, a man twenty-one years her senior. He also gave her his Porsche, after all objects of her childhood memories were ruined by a flood. In The Last One, Monica names her new baby son after her father this being against the Jewish custom. He had admitted he felt like a father when newly born Ross held Jack's finger."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Relationships","level":2,"content":[],"images":[]},{"title":"Judy Geller","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Jack and his wife, Judy love each other very much, therefore they are a very happily married couple."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Ross Geller and Monica Geller","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Like his wife, Jack favors Ross over Monica because of his lovable nature over Monica's silly behavior.
