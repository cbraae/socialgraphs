With crassness and thoughtlessness that leaves Chandler astonished. Ross then hits on her and she doesn't turn him down. But entering a relationship with another man so soon after the\u00a0emotional pain and turmoil\u00a0of breaking up with Eric\u00a0apparently causes Michelle to develop an unhealthy obsession with this new man in her life which seems to be making her mentally unstable,\u00a0as she begins making\u00a0bizarre, crazy\u00a0comments,\u00a0such as claiming that she's worried\u00a0about the \"doody parasites\" and\u00a0upon going to Ross' apartment with him and\u00a0meeting Rachel there, convincing herself that the latter was Ross' daughter and claiming she could be Rachel's \"new mummy\". Quickly realizing that he made a mistake, Ross convinces Michelle to leave, promising to, when she points out that he doesn't know her phone number, merely guess what it is. She is never seen again after that-whether or not she was ever\u00a0able to\u00a0calm down and come to terms with\u00a0the emotional pain that was driving her crazy is unknown, but since she apparently never bothered Ross again, it's safe to assume that she did."}],"images":[]}]}
