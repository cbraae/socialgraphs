Iris agreed to teach them how to play, but probably because she had parked her car\u00a0at a meter\u00a0wasn't very patient with or polite to them, not\u00a0bothering to say hello to them when she walked into the apartment\u00a0but instead\u00a0opening up the conversation by claiming to have hit Tony Randall with her car, then revealing that she was lying in order to demonstrate bluffing to them. She was later annoyed when they lost the game of poker to Joey, Chandler and Ross\u00a0despite\u00a0her\u00a0advice\u00a0and offered to teach them again, but she once again failed to be\u00a0friendly towards them."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"She was portrayed by the late Beverly Garland."}],"images":[]}]}
