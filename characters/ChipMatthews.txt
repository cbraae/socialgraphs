He also had a job working at a movie theater, which he enjoyed because of the free popcorn and candy whenever he wanted.  Chip and Rachel used to date, but on Thanksgiving Day, 1987, he broke up with her for a girl named Nancy Branson, because she was rumored to be a slut. After learning that is was just a rumor, he called Rachel to get back together, which she was happy to do.  Chip also took Rachel to the senior prom. When he didn't come to pick her up, she got very upset, and convinced he wasn't coming. Ross decided that he could take Rachel to the prom, even getting dressed in a suit and make-shifting a bouquet of flowers, but at the last minute, Chip showed up and they left before Ross could say anything.  At the prom, Chip abandoned Rachel to go have sex with a girl named Amy Welsh."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Adult life","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"In \"The One With The Cat\", Monica runs into Chip and they go out on a date, Monica regarding it as a chance to indulge the 'fat girl' inside her who wanted to receive such an offer as a child.
