Charlie was already familiar with Ross's name through one of his academic papers on paleontology but had never met him. Soon, however, Ross and Charlie abandoned the extremely boring Professor Spafford and concluded their fun tour of the NYU campus by returning to Monica's apartment. There, Charlie was introduced to Phoebe (who, out of having fun, inquired about Renyard's theory on species variegation in segmented arthropods) and Monica (who loudly pronounced her a \"hottie\") before attending Joey's party on the roof."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"At the party, when Charlie talked about her former relationships with two Nobel Prize winners and a winner of genius grant, Ross's lack of confidence about his own level of intelligence lead to procrastination, allowing Joey (who has nothing to assert in the way of intelligence or academic achievements) to start a relationship with her."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Relationships","level":2,"content":[],"images":[]},{"title":"Joey Tribbiani","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Charlie and Joey dated during the next four episodes. This relationship quickly ran its course when Joey's innate raw magnetism was overpowered by the fact that he had nothing in the way of intelligence or education, did not know the meaning of the word \"acrimonious\" (yet insisted on using it) and could not correctly identify left or right. During the paleontology conference in Barbados, Charlie had to run discussion groups or work with Ross to prepare the keynote speech, during which Joey made a fool of himself by insisting on adding Star Wars material to the presentation. At the keynote speech, Charlie, full of admiration, mouthed words with Ross; she was very disappointed to discover that the only thing that Rachel and Joey found interesting in it were the words \"homo\" and \"erectus\". Eventually, discovering that she and Joey were worlds apart, Charlie concluded the relationship. Shortly afterwards, she started her relationship with Ross."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Ross Geller","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"In spite of a very awkward instance of drunkenness on Ross's part in \"The One Where Ross Is Fine\", Charlie and Ross had a rather uneventful relationship until \"The One With Ross's Grant\", where Benjamin Hobart, Charlie's previous boyfriend and winner of two Nobel prizes, reveals that he still has feelings for her.
