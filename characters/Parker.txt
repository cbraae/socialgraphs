This implies that Parker\u00a0actually wasn't\u00a0such a nice guy after all-outwardly friendly, but inwardly very selfish and also rather manipulative."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Given Parker's constant enthusiasm, inability to calm down or keep his attention on any one thing for long such as his anger towards Phoebe after their argument and break-up, impulsive behavior such as putting his hand on the pregnant Rachel's stomach before she could give him permission when he asked for it, badgering Phoebe into eating an oyster despite her protests before refusing to eat one himself because they \"looked too weird\" and giving Chandler a friendly punch on the arm with so much energetic force that he accidentally hurt him in the process, and obliviousness, failing to notice he was irritating people and that he'd hurt Chandler, he most likely unknowingly suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, his perfectly calm demeanor when he and Phoebe met for the first time at the drycleaner's and the fact that she had enjoyed his company and never found him to be too enthusiastic prior to the night he accompanied her to the party suggests\u00a0that he isn't usually so over-excited about everything, making it safe to speculate that prior to meeting up with her and her friends he may, perhaps in an attempt to combat nervous feelings about going to a place he'd never been to before and being surrounded by so many people he'd never met before, have been drinking that night."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Trivia","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Parker's portrayer, Alec Baldwin, was mentioned by Ross in \"The One With Rachel's Crush\" (S4E13).","elements":[]},{"text":"Apparently, he was based on a real life boyfriend of one of the creators.","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
