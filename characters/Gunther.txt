This becomes a running joke. At Ross' bachelor party, Chandler announces Gunther as his best man, to which Gunther immediately replies: \"What's my last name?\". Chandler defeatedly answers \"Central Perk?\". Another example of this is when Ross is celebrating getting tenure. Ross asks Gunther for six glasses, to which Gunther asks hopefully \"You want me to join you?\". Ross replies \"Oh, I thought Joey was here - five is good.\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Gunther is on good enough terms with the friends, however, to often be invited to their informal parties, such as Phoebe's birthday party, Rachel's birthday party, Emily's farewell party, Ross' bachelor party, Rachel's premature surprise birthday party and Chandler and Monica's Halloween party.

In Season 5, when helping Rachel get over Ross, Monica includes Gunther in the list of prospective dates for Rachel, which he overhears and shows off his posture in reply. Rachel begins to say \"I guess he is kind of cute\" only to be thrown off course by an old flirt of hers, which Gunther identifies and throws out of Central Perk. Ross and Monica's mother, Judy, remarks how Gunther is a \"sexy blond\" and prominently adds him to her \"list\" of people she can sleep with without cheating."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Phoebe also gives small impressions that she may secretly be attracted to Gunther, despite often mocking him before (\"That hair on a baby!\"). She once remarked \"Sure, Gunther is sexy in an obvious way...\", and when referring to the number of attractive men in Paris, says that \"it's like a city of Gunthers\".

Gunther comes up to him and screams \"YOU IDIOT!\". When Phoebe kisses him to get her cold back, he apologizes to Rachel for not stopping the kiss.

In what she thought was an encouraging remark, she tells him one day he would make \"some guy the luckiest man in the world\".
