However, while they and the two\u00a0now more casually dressed bullies are discussing the rules for the fight, Ross and Chandler\u00a0notice some wannabe thieves making off with the valuables they had set aside for the fight and give chase. Ironically, the four men end up joining forces to chase down and fight off the would-be thieves, and they bury the hatchet."}],"images":[]}]}
