This would make sense if you count Rachel's pregnancy as beginning from the Season 8 premiere (which was aired in September 2001). In the white Friends box set there is a book that shows a prop of Emma's name tag, stating she was born on the 4th April, 2002. Similarly, in the episode \"The One With The Cheap Wedding Dress\" Monica tells another bride she is getting married on the 15th of May, meaning that Rachel is pregnant in May. However in the episode \"The One With Ross's Step Forward\", Phoebe states that Rachel is 4 months pregnant but this can't be correct as the episode aired in December, Rachel should be 7 months pregnant by then.
