Danny also still playfully chases his sister around and tickles her even when she's half naked, and they see nothing wrong with still\u00a0taking their baths together; it appears as though, bizarrely, they haven't developed any physical intimacy issues upon growing up\u00a0at all."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"According to Danny, she and him once climbed a mountain together, and he got annoyed with her when he realized she had forgotten to bring a camera. This reminded Joey of when he and Chandler were jogging through a park and saw a \"really pretty bird\" but couldn't take a picture because they didn't have a camera.
