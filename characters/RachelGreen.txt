Rachel also mentions that her birthday is after Valentine's Day in, \"The One With The Girl From Poughkeepsie\" (\"Next thing you know, it'll be Valentine's Day, then my birthday, then ... Bang! They're lighting that damned tree again.\") A birthday in February is also consistent with Rachel's statement to a police officer in season seven that she is an Aquarius (Jan. 21-Feb. 19).

This makes her the youngest of the six characters, the one thing that has never seemed to be disputed by the show. However, the 29th birthday in 1999 (season five's \"The One Where Rachel Smokes\") implies that she was born in 1970. In other episodes, Rachel's stated age is inconsistent with birth in either 1971 and advances at varying speeds. Chandler refers to her as 28 in season three's \"The One Where Rachel Quits\" (December 12, 1996), but 15 months later Rachel describes herself as \"a 28-year old cheerleader with a fat lip\" in season four's \"The One With The Fake Party\" (March 19, 1998).
