{"sections":[{"title":"Chloe","level":1,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Chloe is an attractive girl who works at a Xerox store in Manhattan. Her co-worker and close friend is Isaac. She played a small part in season 3 when she initially asked Joey and Chandler out- the two spending the time before the date wondering how they would manage the subsequent threesome-, but they eventually left, resulting in Chloe sleeping with Ross, who at the time was\u00a0drunk and believed\u00a0that his relationship with Rachel was already over. This one incident was enough to break the two up until the very end of the show, even though there were various signs that a relationship could start again in the intervening time. Chloe has no problem at all with sleeping with committed guys (even married ones) and has the habit of stealing stuff after sleeping with them."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Trivia","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"Chloe is mentioned between the guys several episodes before she was seen, the first time being between Ross and Chandler in \"The One With The Princess Leia Fantasy\" when they are discussing sex.","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]},{"title":"Appearances","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"\"The One With The Princess Leia Fantasy\" (First mentioned)","elements":[]},{"text":"\"The One With The Jam\" (Mentioned only)","elements":[]},{"text":"\"The One Where Ross and Rachel Take A Break\" (First appearance)","elements":[]},{"text":"\"The One With The Morning After\"","elements":[]},{"text":"\"The One Without The Ski Trip\" (Mentioned as 'someone else' and 'another woman')","elements":[]},{"text":"\"The One With The Tiny T-Shirt\" (Mentioned as 'somebody')","elements":[]},{"text":"\"The One With The Jellyfish\" (Mentioned only)","elements":[]},{"text":"\"The One With The Invitation\" (Appears in flashback)","elements":[]}]}],"images":[]}]}
