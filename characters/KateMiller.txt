The two sleep together at one point, but Kate passes it off as a one-time thing, leaving Joey shocked at the sudden change of tradition with him being the one who is dumped after a night that meant more to him than it did to the other person. The play turns out to be dismal, and after the director dumps her she gets together with Joey in \"The One With The Screamer\". Despite the two of them sharing 'the Night'- a term used by Monica to refer to a night when two people share their deepest thoughts and feelings, including Joey learning that Kate has two brothers and one of them died-, Kate nevertheless leaves for a soap opera role in Los Angeles, sadly telling Joey that she cannot stay in New York just for him. Joey, unable to say goodbye to Kate as she has to leave before the show finishes, channels his emotions at her loss into his character's farewell speech in the play. Kate manages to stay long enough until the end of the scene to see him say goodbye to her."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Trivia","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"She has two brothers, one of whom died.","elements":[]},{"text":"In the episode The One In Barbados, Joey and Rachel, in hope of getting into the Pharmaceutical convention, use fake IDs in which one of the names is \"Kate Miller\".
