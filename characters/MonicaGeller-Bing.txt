She met Chandler Bing at her parents' house on Thanksgiving 1987. She initially had a crush on him (even became a chef because he told her that he liked her macaroni) until she overheard him referring to her as Ross' \"fat sister.\" The shock was so great for her that she became determined to lose all her extra weight by the next time he would see her.
