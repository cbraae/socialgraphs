Mona and Ross began their relationship just as Ross learned that Rachel was pregnant with his child. However, when Ross asked Rachel to move in with him because of the baby, Mona broke up with him."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Her relationship with Ross was often plagued with unfortunate coincidences, such as Ross giving her a key\u00a0to his apartment before being\u00a0forced to change the locks and\u00a0her finding out on Valentine's Day that\u00a0Rachel had moved in with him."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Relationships","level":2,"content":[],"images":[]},{"title":"Ross Geller","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Mona's relationship with Ross could be described as more friendly than romantic even when they were dating. Ross takes things a lot more slowly with Mona than he did with other girls. A few instances of this was when he was willing to adopt a cat with Julie, and proposed to Emily after dating for only six weeks. In contrast, Ross had met Mona in May during Monica and Chandler's wedding and in \"The One With Ross' Step Forward\", which takes place in December, he was trying to dissuade her from sending out holiday cards. Their relationship later became complicated due to Ross being the father of Rachel's baby and Ross regularly forgetting dates with her when Rachel had pregnancy problems Their relationship ultimately ended on Valentine's Day in \"The One With The Birthing Video\". Two episodes later, Ross sneaks over to Mona's apartment to retrieve his favorite salmon shirt when she returns with another boyfriend. During the credits, Mona comes over to his apartment because she thinks he still has feelings for her (but that wasn't it; he only wanted his shirt back). She admits she still has feelings for him, but it is too complicated for them to work. She asks if she can keep the shirt to remember him but Ross says no."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Rachel Green","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Mona also seemed to have a good relationship with Rachel. She was very supportive of Ross and Rachel having a baby (she even bought a t-shirt that says \"Fossils are my friends\"), but wasn't happy that Ross was forgetting about her when Rachel was having baby trouble, although they still maintained a good friendship (But it could be possible that Rachel secretly disliked Mona because Ross had abandoned her for Mona during pregnancy and Rachel was wanting to talk to him about the possible re-kindling of a relationship, but this was mostly unlikely- Even in Season 2, Rachel despised Ross' girlfriend Julie because she was in love with Ross at the same time). Mona didn't even attend Rachel's baby shower, but that was because her appearances in the show were finished."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Monica Geller","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Mona and Monica were colleagues at Allesandro's.

She was very offended after Dr. Green called her a tramp and was hoping that her relationship with Ross would not end while Ross and Dr. Green were bickering about Rachel (Ross couldn't tell Leonard the truth because he knew it will upset Mona). As for that, Mona and Dr. Green hated each other the same way Ross and Dr. Green do."}],"images":[]},{"title":"New boyfriend","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Mona had a new unnamed boyfriend sometime after she and Ross broke up and the relationship was obviously a good one when they are seen passionately making out on the couch after Mona gives him Ross' salmon shirt to wear after she accidentally spilled wine on his other shirt.
