Ross was asked to show them both around the campus, and because he was attracted to Charlie, he tried to seize an opportunity to spend the day with her alone when Spafford didn't turn up at first, only for\u00a0Spafford to then walk through the door and introduce himself, causing Ross to\u00a0exclaim \"Dammit!\" much to the bemusement of Charlie and Spafford. However, Ross later got the chance to spend the day alone with Charlie anyway, as Spafford spoke very slowly and with a lack of enthusiasm or emotion, causing Ross and Charlie to find him so boring socially that they decided to abandon him while he was in the bathroom. He was never seen again after that."}],"images":[]}]}
