He had a strong distaste for Ross and disapproved of his relationship with Elizabeth. Paul was played by Bruce Willis in a three-episode story arc."}],"images":[]},{"title":"History","level":2,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Paul is an eccentric character who makes fun of Ross whenever he can. A muscular, physically imposing man, he intimidates him very much and takes advantage of it. No matter how hard poor Ross tries his best to be polite to his girlfriend's father, Paul shows almost no hesitation whatsoever to snipe at Ross with mean and harsh words. When they first meet, Ross bemuses both him and Elizabeth with daft comments as he desperately tries to impress Paul."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Paul's wife had Elizabeth when they were very young and his wife died when Elizabeth was just a baby. As a result of this, he raised her on his own. He mentions having a sister who also died."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Paul stated his reason for disapproving of Ross's relationship with his daughter as being the fact that Ross was older than she was. However, Paul ends up in a relationship with Rachel, proving him to be somewhat of a hypocrite since he is considerably older than she is. This upsets Ross greatly, but Rachel convinces him that she can change Paul's opinion of him."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Eventually Paul decides to accept Ross and Elizabeth's relationship, but quickly changes his mind and tells Ross that if he doesn't end it, he will call the university Ross works at and have him fired, as Elizabeth is one of his students and Ross will be sacked if they find out he's dating one of his students. Ross and Elizabeth decide to continue their relationship in secrecy. One weekend they go away to Elizabeth's grandmother's cabin. However, Paul has decided to surprise Rachel and take her there on the same weekend. After trying to escape, with the help of Elizabeth and Rachel, Ross is caught by Paul. But not before Ross, who had been hiding under the bed in Paul's bedroom, saw Paul talking and singing exaggeratedly to himself in the mirror, revealing his cocky and deluded side. After Ross, in a subtle manner while in front of Rachel and Elizabeth, threatens to reveal this to Rachel if Paul informs the university of the relationship and has him sacked, Paul, out of embarrassment and fear, seemingly finally accepts him. Both of them, however, still do not like each other."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Later, Rachel starts to worry about her relationship with Paul because of how private he is. She tells him that she wants to know more about him and he tells her about the time that he was six and his parents bought him a \"plastic chicken you hop around on\" instead of Big Wheels like he wanted. He reveals that kids made fun of him and even called him 'Chicken Boy', making him a very insecure person. He begins crying for hours, revealing more about his childhood to Rachel. Even the mention of chicken causes Paul to burst into tears. It is also revealed that Paul had issues with his father who never hugged him. When Chandler walks into the room, Paul asks Chandler if his father ever hugged him, causing Chandler to reply \"Did he ever hug you?\" much to Paul's irritation and bemusement. However, Paul still asks Chandler to hold him, and when Joey walks into the room, Paul runs over to him and lifts him off of the floor while hugging him, too."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Rachel finally gets Paul to calm down long enough to have sex.

It seems\u00a0that he had a good relationship with his sister before she died, due to his sad look when speaking of her\u00a0with the gang."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Since Paul mentions that the cabin was his mother's and that he misses his father, it is likely that his parents are dead too."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Paul most likely had a good relationship with his wife.

He claims that this is because of the age gap between Ross and his daughter while they were in a relationship, but his relationship with Rachel, who is considerably younger than he is, contradicts this attitude. Every time Ross tried to be polite to Paul, all the latter could do was snipe at Ross with mean and harsh words.\u00a0Although\u00a0Paul eventually stopped being nasty to Ross\u00a0after the latter\u00a0blackmailed him, the two of them still did not like each other.\u00a0Presumably, Paul was pleased when Ross and Elizabeth broke up."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"It is also highly likely and obvious that Ross was jealous of Paul due to the latter going out with Rachel, Ross's true love. Coincidentally, Ross showed obvious signs of jealousy like when Paul left him and Rachel at her and Joey's apartment, he kept asking \"What the, how did...?\" and when Rachel tells him Paul was looking for his keys, Ross incredulously replies \"In your mouth?!\" obviously showing disgust at the sight of Paul and Rachel kissing; so Ross was presumably happy when Paul and Rachel broke up."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Rachel Green","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Paul had quite a good relationship with Rachel.

When Joey walked into the room, Paul ran up to him and lifted him off of the floor while hugging him too, which left both Joey and Chandler bewildered as Joey and Paul apparently didn't even know each other that well, as Joey, while being lifted off of the floor, said in a confused tone of voice, \"Hi, Paul, is it?\" They understandably weren't very enthusiastic about the fact that Paul would probably be joining them and Ross at a Knicks game as a result.
