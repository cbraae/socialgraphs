Unfortunately, she got chicken pox from Ben and her plans were ruined. Ryan was bemused when he, upon walking into Monica's\u00a0apartment, saw Phoebe with her head covered with a scarf, trying to prevent him from seeing that she had caught chicken pox. When he eventually convinced her to let him see her face, lightning from a storm raging outside flashed and scared Ryan, causing Phoebe to mistakenly think he was scared by her appearance. When trying to convince her that it was the lightning that had scared him and that it was an unfortunate coincidence that it had flashed just as she had shown him her face didn't work, Ryan declared that he would not let \"a couple of itchy... spots\" stand between them...and consequently ended up catching it as well."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"They spent the time in home playing board games and trying to ignore the itch; with poor results, as they always ended up scratching each other.
