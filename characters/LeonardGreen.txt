He and his wife divorced shortly after Rachel left her fiance Barry at the altar; her mom told Rachel, \"you didn't marry your Barry, honey, but I married mine.\" While he and Rachel have a fairly fractious relationship, he has said to his friends and youngest daughter Jill (but not to her) that she is the only one of his children he is proud of. He hates Ross and is highly critical of him, especially after he finds out Ross made Rachel pregnant and at the same time would not marry her. Like many of the characters on the show, including his wife and daughter, Dr. Green\u00a0is a traditional Jewish stereotype: the overbearing, oft-critical doctor. Dr. Green\u00a0is also a hypocrite - a smoking cardiologist, he scared a young Rachel with smoker's lungs yet kept puffing away, perhaps leading to his heart attack. Ron Leibman once said of his character: \"I may have won a Tony... but everyone asks, 'Aren't you Rachel's Dad?'\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Dr. Green\u00a0was first mentioned in the 23rd episode, \"The One With The Birth\". Chandler said to Rachel, \"What is it with you and doctors? Is your dad, like, a doctor?\" Rachel replied, \"Yeah. Why?\" This was not the first episode to mention Dr. Green, but it was the first mention that he was a doctor. He was shown in the episode \"The One With The Two Parties\", where he drops by to wish his daughter a happy birthday. However, this kind gesture is ruined when he seizes the party as an opportunity to explain his reasons for the divorce to Rachel. In \"The One With The Race Car Bed,\" Rachel tries to get him and Ross to bond with each other. In \"The One With The Stripper,\" Dr. Green\u00a0learns that Rachel is pregnant. The last scene featuring Dr. Green\u00a0was in \"The One Where Joey Speaks French\", in which he has a heart attack."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Although Leonard, like his daughter Amy, was a deliberately unpleasant and unlikable character, the comic relief he provided caused him to, again like his daughter Amy, become memorable as a character fans \"loved to hate.\""}],"images":[]},{"title":"Biography","level":2,"content":[],"images":[]},{"title":"Before the show","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Dr. Leonard Green\u00a0was born to Mr. Green\u00a0and Ida Green; it is unknown if he had any siblings. In his later life, he grew up to become a vascular surgeon and became very rich, even owning a mansion and a boat. He married a woman named Sandra and the marriage turned out to be a problem because they couldn't get along and they frequently argued and barely even spoke. Together, they had 3 daughters: Amy, Rachel and Jill. According to Sandra, Leonard generally showed more interest in and concern for his boat than her."}],"images":[]},{"title":"The One With The Two Parties","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"This is Dr. Green's first appearance in the show. He drops by to wish Rachel a happy birthday and attends the party going on in Joey and Chandler's apartment. Ross tries to bond with him, but ends up making a fool of himself when he calls a vascular surgery a \"game\" and when Dr. Green\u00a0catches Ross wearing his glasses and having a cigarette in his mouth. Leonard is unaware of the fact that Sandra is in Rachel's apartment, and\u00a0whenever\u00a0Rachel speaks to him, he complains about Sandra while the reverse happens whenever Rachel speaks to Sandra,\u00a0which drives Rachel crazy. Near the end of this episode,\u00a0Leonard leaves none the wiser about\u00a0Sandra's presence in Rachel's apartment,\u00a0but it's possible that Dr. Green\u00a0was wondering what Ross was doing while he was hiding Rachel's mother behind him while Joey was kissing her to prevent the two exes from intercepting."}],"images":[]},{"title":"The One With The Race Car Bed","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Dr. Green\u00a0arrives at the restaurant where he has dinner with Rachel and Ross and Rachel tries to have her father and boyfriend bond.

The next day at Rachel's apartment, the three of them have a brunch and Ross and Dr. Green are at odds again but soon find themselves bonding over making fun\u00a0of Rachel's chiropractor and various lack of good sense.

It is here that Rachel tries to tell him that she's pregnant, which she does and is okay but isn't quite impressed that Ross is the father and later that Rachel tells him that there's not gonna be a wedding. She lies to him by saying that Ross won't marry her because \"he says she's damaged goods.\" He goes over to Ross's apartment where he and Mona are dating and then a scene happens between the three with Mona now knowing about Rachel's pregnancy, Dr. Green and Ross arguing and Dr. Green calling Mona a tramp. He is not seen again in the episode, but is heard over the phone at Joey's apartment during the credits where he's yelling at Rachel because she told him the truth and she leaves the phone open and on the table and goes out to a movie with Phoebe leaving Dr. Green unaware that he is now yelling at nobody. Joey comes out of his room and hears voices then takes the phone and listens to Dr. Green talking (but they both don't know who is on the line) and Joey answers \"Hey, I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!\" and then \"Well, what gives you the right to--?\" and then the last thing Joey says to Dr. Green before hanging up the phone is \"Go to hell!\" and quickly hangs up.

He then asks him what he's doing at the hospital, asks him if whether the heart attack or talking to Ross is painful and if he (Ross) knocked up any more of his daughters to which Ross replies \"Nope.

Dr. Green's last on-screen appearance was back in the hospital the next day where Ross and Rachel had a disagreement over sympathy sex and he comes out of his room and glares at Ross with a deadly look, thinking that Ross and Rachel have just had sex again, after Ross turns around to him and asks if he's feeling better."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Relationships","level":2,"content":[],"images":[]},{"title":"Sandra Green","level":3,"content":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Dr. Green and his ex-wife, Sandra happened to have an imploding relationship and marriage.

This surprised Rachel who was touched her father believes in her capabilities."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Despite this there has been some moments in which Rachel's relationship with Leonard is difficult, because of Dr. Green being a harsh disciplinarian and having to have everything his own way and Rachel a less obnoxious and more caring person and Dr. Green not being completely okay with everything; For example, Dr. Green was angry by the fact that she decided not to get married when having a baby with Ross (Obviously due to his dislike of illegitimate birth because he did not want his first grandchild to be a bastard).

In Dr. Green's first appearance in Season 2, he disliked Ross almost instantly, like when Ross was joking about vascular surgery being a game and wearing the former's glasses and having one of his cigarettes, resulting in Chandler making of himself."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"During the rest of Dr. Green's appearances (and non-appearances) in the show whenever he interacted with Ross, the two of them detested each other continually.

It's likely that Monica disliked Leonard for the way he always treated her brother, while Phoebe claimed in \"The One With The Stripper\" to be sexually attracted to him, which turned out to be ironic as Leonard later revealed he mistakenly thought she was a lesbian-and seemed to imply that he looked down on her because of that.
