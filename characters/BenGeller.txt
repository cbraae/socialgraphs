He is raised by his mother Carol and her\u00a0lesbian\u00a0partner, Susan, so Ross only gets to 'babysit' Ben on occasion. Ben is rarely seen with the other Friends, who were present at (or very near) his birth. This causes him to sometimes mix up their names, like calling Rachel Phoebe. The gang all adore Ben, but prove pretty unreliable babysitters, not just Joey and Chandler (who lose Ben on a bus while Joey does his babe-magnet act) but even devoted and domestic Aunts Monica and Rachel, who teach Ben pranks that end up being pulled on his parents. Being spoiled by three rivalling parents, and bright by nature, Ben grows up as an amusing rascal. Although he seems to get on with the other Friends, as well as his father, Ross, he was once both bemused and frightened by Phoebe when he witnessed her losing her cool over an arcade game in Monica's apartment. Apart from that one incident, there is no evidence of him ever becoming upset with any of the Friends."}],"images":[]},{"title":"Trivia","level":2,"content":[{"type":"list","elements":[{"text":"In \"The One With The Sonogram At The End\", there were arguments over what Ben's surname was to be; Carol and Susan originally wanted him to have the surname 'Willick-Bunch' which caused Ross to angrily insist that they include his own name.
