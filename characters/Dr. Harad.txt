He is depicted as having a strong obsession with the Happy Days character Arthur Fonzarelli,\u00a0to the point where\u00a0he would frequently, sometimes completely spontaneously,\u00a0bring up the Fonz in conversation, even when he was supposed to be comforting Phoebe while she was in labour. His\u00a0unsettling constant references to the Fonz\u00a0made Phoebe very uncomfortable to be in his presence while she was in labour;\u00a0she asked Ross to find her a different doctor who would be more suitable for the job of delivering her babies through her eyes which he tried to do but without success, leaving her stuck with Harad. Despite his Fonz obsession however, Harad ultimately proved himself to be a highly competent doctor who successfully delivered all three of the triplets."}],"images":[]}]}
