Good thing Chandler's not here.<br> He always wins at this game.<br> I just told my mom I'd cater her party.<br> -How come? -I need the money.<br> It'd be a great way to get rid of that last smidgen of self-respect.<br> I think this is a good thing.<br> Mom wouldn't have hired you if you weren't good.<br> You don't have to stick up for her.<br> She can't hear you.<br> Do you have any juice? Just pickle.<br> Funny story.<br> I bumped into Joanna yesterday.<br> My boss, Joanna? That must have been awkward.<br> Actually, she asked me if I wanted a drink.<br> You didn't say yes to that, did you? Hello, Rachel.<br> Well, not at first.<br> What is she doing here? Last time you went out with her you said she was a dud! I judged her too quickly.<br> This time, we took it to the next level.<br> Last time I almost got fired.<br> You must end it.<br> You must end it now.<br> It's not an everyday occurrence! Usually I'm in there by myself.<br> Promise.<br> -Rachel, aren't you running late? -No -You are if you pick me up a bagel.<br> -Okay.<br> Promise you will end this now.<br> -I promise.<br> I'll end it.<br> -Thank you.<br> I hope you know what I'm giving up.<br> She's not just the boss in your office.<br> You know what I mean? Sorry.<br> I knew what he meant.<br> How's the hired help? Doing great.<br> Quiches are coming along.<br> What's this? Blue nail polish? I thought it was cute.<br> It's what your grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.<br> Let me ask you a question.<br> Why did you hire me? Richard raved about the food at his party but you were sleeping with him.<br> Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was nice.<br> I assume you didn't sleep with anyone there.<br> At least that would be something.<br> Oh, my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I'm good.<br> I didn't hear that.<br> She didn't hire me out of pity.<br> It wasn't so she could pick on me.<br> She actually thinks I'm good.<br> And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian.<br> Good afternoon.<br> Are you the decision-maker of the house? Do you currently own a set of encyclopedias?

Come on in.<br> -That's weird.<br> -What? Your nails.<br> I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn't give me grief about biting them.<br> I meant, it's weird that you only have nine now.<br> Oh, my God! Wait a minute.<br> I had them when I put Oh, my God! It's in the quiche! -Oh, my God! -Okay, don't panic.<br> I'll go buy you a new set of nails.<br> No one will know, and you'll look great! It's because they're going to eat That's the problem.<br> Honey, don't bite your nails.<br> Please don't freak out.<br> There's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups.<br> And there's no way to know which one.<br> And whoever finds it wins the prize! I'm not freaking out.<br> -Why are you laughing? -Now your father owes me $5.<br> You bet I'd lose a nail? Don't be silly.<br> I just bet that I'd need these.<br> Frozen lasagnas? You bet that I'd screw up? All that stuff about how I was good No, that was all true.<br> This was just in case you "pulled a Monica.<br>" You promised Dr.<br> Weinberg you'd never use that phrase.<br> Come on.<br> Have a sense of humor.<br> You're never able to laugh at yourself.<br> That's right.<br> My mom has no faith in me!

Knowing you're here waiting for me.<br> I think it's exciting, don't you? If you don't come back soon there's pretty much nothing I can do about it! I brought you back a macaroon.<br> Great.<br> I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.<br> That's weird.<br> She locked the door.<br> You know why?

And on a totally separate subject, that's a lovely pantsuit.<br> You promised you would break up with her.<br> I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well! Jeopardizing my career never entered your mind? It did enter my mind.<br> But then something happened that made it shoot right out.<br> You got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out.<br> I can't get myself right out of them.<br> You must have me confused with the "Amazing Chandler"! Unlock me! She could be gone for hours, and I'm cold and.<br> All right! This is it! Never see her again.<br> Never! -Never come in here again.<br> -Fine! Give me back my Walkman! I never borrowed it.<br> Then I lost it.<br> Buy me one! You got it! Here we go! Come on.<br> This is great! Does it hurt?

Just change what it means.<br> Prove your mother wrong.<br> You finish the job, and we'll call that "pulling a Monica.<br>" What? If a kid gets straight A's, his parents say, "You pulled a Monica.<br>" A fireman saves a baby, and they go, "He pulled a Monica.<br>" Someone hits a homer, and they say, "That one's out of here.<br>" Because some things don't change.<br> All right.<br> I'll go down there.<br> I won't serve the lasagna.<br> I'll serve what I make.<br> My breasts are really strong.<br> I have to get you locked back up.<br> I'm so going to lose my job!
