                    			Hey, you guys? What are you doing tomorrow night? Oh, well, let me see.<br> I believe I'm Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.<br> Well, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.<br> I could fall asleep at a play.<br> - What is it? - It's a one-woman play called: Why Don 't You Like Me? A Bitter Woman 's Journey Through Life.<br> - That sounds interesting.<br> - That does sound interesting.<br> To listen to a woman complain for two hours.<br> I don't think it gets bet I know! I know.<br> We can drive.<br> We can vote.<br> We can work.<br> What more do these broads want? Well, you guys will have a great time.<br> I promise.<br> What? How come you don't have to go? I wish I could, but I found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go.<br> But take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.<br> Let's see.<br> Who do I hate? Oh, sorry.<br> - Oops, sorry.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> Up we go.<br> - Oh, gosh, okay! - All right.<br> Can I ask you a question? Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and not have it be a big deal? No, I don't think that ever works.<br> Why? - No reason.<br> - No, no.<br> Rachel? - Who do you want to fool around with? - Nobody! Forget it.<br> Joey? Maybe.<br> - You can't.<br> - Why? Because! Okay, seriously, did not understand a word you just said.<br> - In the hall.<br> - Okay.<br> - You wanna fool around with Joey? - Yeah.<br> Ever since I had that dream about him, I can't get it out of my head.<br> I mean, what's the big deal? People do it all the time.<br> Who do you know that are friends that just fool around? Okay.<br> Off the top of my head Don and Janet.<br> - Who are they? - I know them from work.<br> - Both of them? - No, just one of them.<br> Which one? I don't know.<br> What were the names I just said? No, Rachel, things could get incredibly complicated.<br> You're right.<br> I won't do anything with Joey.<br> I just thought it Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon, a pound of baking soda and a red onion? What the hell are you cooking? The One With The Soap Opera Party mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 You guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.<br> Yes, but, Ross, you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.<br> There are these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.<br> What's bad about that? I just know they'll be a couple of old windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.<br> Ross? What? These aren't suede.<br> Excuse me.<br> I'm looking for someone.<br> You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller? No.<br> Hi.<br> Hi, I'm Ross Geller.<br> Oh, hi.<br> I'm Professor Wheeler.<br> Oh, that's That's That's nice.<br> It's good to meet you.<br> Thank you so much for taking the time to show me around.<br> No, it's no big deal.<br> If I weren't doing this, I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.<br> Is he gonna introduce us? I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.<br> By the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.<br> I wrote that in one night.<br> Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.<br> Well, we should probably get going.<br> We've got a lot of ground to cover.<br> Isn't another professor supposed to come with us? I don't think so.<br> I'm pretty sure.<br> A Professor Spafford from Cornell? Well, he's obviously late, and the rule in my class is: If you can't come on time, then don't come at all.<br> An option that many of my students use.<br> - Shall we? - We shouldn't wait for him? You know what, he's a big boy.<br> I'm sure he'll find us, okay? - Professor Geller? - Oh, damn it! "Hi", "it's Jan Rogers.<br>" Can 't wait for your party tonight.<br> "Listen", "I forgot your address.<br>" Can you give me a call? Thanks.<br> Bye.<br> What's happening? It's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.<br> I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day.<br> - You know me, work comes first.<br> - Oh, yeah, yeah.<br> "Hi", "it's Jan Rogers.<br>" Can 't wait for your party tonight.<br> Stupid Jan Rogers! You are having a party tonight? I'm kind of having a thing for the "Days of Our Lives" people.<br> You weren't gonna tell us? How did you think you'd get away with that? I do it every year.<br> You do that every year?! I didn't have to tell you that! God, I'm stupider than Jan Rogers! That's why you got us tickets to that play, to get rid of us! Yeah.<br> Last year is that why you sent us to that Medieval Times restaurant? Yeah.<br> The year before that, you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory? I can't believe you guys went for that one.<br> Why wouldn't you invite us to your parties? You're fine, okay? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people.<br> Well, then, so just invite me.<br> Please, I was trying to be nice.<br> You're the worst one.<br> Joey, come on! Please, please? Let me come.<br> I will behave.<br> I promise.<br> - I will behave.<br> Please, please, please.<br> - Okay, fine.<br> You can come.<br> But don't tell anybody else.<br> It's up on the roof at 8.<br> A soap-opera roof party?! I'm going to a soap-opera roof party! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! And it's out of my system.<br> And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos.<br> There was a seafood buffet you wouldn't believe.<br> There were clams and mussels and oysters and cracked crab and snow crab and king crab.<br> It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.<br> So where did you get your undergraduate degree? - And that's not all I'm allergic to.<br> - Oh, it's not over.<br> I'm also allergic to peanuts and cashews and almonds and filberts So basically all nuts! Interestingly, no.<br> You're kind of playing it fast and loose with the word "interesting.<br>" If you'll excuse me, I'm going to use the restroom.<br> Oh, my God! I've lost the will to live.<br> - Let's ditch him.<br> - What? While he's still in the bathroom.<br> I am begging you.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, fine, but I just have one question for you.<br> When we exit, should we walk or run or prance or stroll? Stop it! Stop it! He talks slow, but he might pee fast.<br> Okay, let's move! Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.<br> Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.<br> - Hi.<br> - Charlie will be joining my department.<br> - You're a paleontologist too? - Yeah.<br> Oh, okay.<br> Now, what do you think of Renyard's new theory of species variegation in segmented arthropods? Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I have to take this.<br> Excuse me.<br> Renyard's theory of species variegation? I saw the article on your coffee table.<br> I memorized the title to freak you out.<br> So did you two have fun? Oh, my God.<br> She's great.<br> We have so much in common, and she's just cool, you know? And funny.<br> And I don't know if you've noticed, but she's a hottie! Hi! Hi, you guys.<br> Listen, you know what, I'm not feeling really well and I don't think I'm gonna get to go to the play.<br> Really? What's wrong? I don't know.<br> I think it's kind of serious.<br> You know, I was watching this thing on TV this morning about Newcastle disease, and I think I might have it.<br> Newcastle disease is a secretion-borne virus that only affects chickens and other poultry.<br> Okay, who's this? I'm sorry.<br> Rachel, this is Charlie Wheeler.<br> She's a colleague.<br> Hi.<br> Well, I would shake your hand but I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease.<br> - Rachel, can I see you for a second? - Sure.<br> You're not sick.<br> What? Yes, I am! Okay, then why are you all dressed up? When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better.<br> You just want to stay home so you can make a move on Joey.<br> No, I heard you before.<br> That is so not what this is.<br> Okay, then what is this? Okay.<br> Joey is having a secret "Days of Our Lives" party up on the roof.<br> And he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you.<br> What?! What? What's going on? Joey is having a secret "Days of Our Lives" party up on the roof! He didn't want you to know about it, but I came over here to tell you.<br> - You came to say you were sick.<br> - All right, professor or detective? Wait, Joey's having a party, and he wasn't gonna invite us? He does it every year.<br> That's why he's sending you to the play.<br> That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory.<br> And that horrible museum tour? No, I arranged that.<br> Hey, you guys, I'm turning in.<br> Have fun.<br> We know about your party, Joey.<br> - What party? - The game's over.<br> Take off your robe.<br> Okay, I mean Close it up! Close it up! Nice to meet you.<br> Hey, you made it! All right! Glad you could make it.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> Kyle Lowder! - Hi.<br> I love you! That's why I didn't invite you.<br> You have to calm down, all right? Just get yourself a drink or something.<br> Oh, yeah, that's what you want.<br> My inhibitions lowered.<br> Oh, my God, can you believe we're surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.<br> You might want to remember that you're married.<br> Where is Chandler anyway? Oh, my God! Chandler! Where the hell is everybody? Why Don 't You Like Me? Chapter 1: My First Period.<br> Hey, Joey said no autographs.<br> But if she's getting one, I want one too! "To Monica.<br>" And none of this "best wishes" crap.<br> I want "love.<br>" Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was giving me his phone number.<br> Oh, man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would've gotten married! - It was nice to meet you.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - Call me.<br> - We will! Look at you with all the guys! I guess you've forgotten all about Joey.<br> Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey.<br> And clearly, you've forgotten about Chandler.<br> Please.<br> Chandler's the love of my life.<br> Oh, leather pants! Have mercy! So it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh? Actually, I'm kind of happy to be leaving.<br> I just broke up with someone.<br> Oh, so sad.<br> Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard.<br> Especially after working with a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.<br> Actually, Albie is the guy I broke up with.<br> - You dated Albert Wintermeyer? - Yeah.<br> And you called him "Albie"? I mean, that's like calling Albert Einstein Albie.<br> Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.<br> You think? I mean, you dated the guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10! Yes, and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend he had a lot of issues.<br> Oh, like what? I'm sorry.<br> I don't mean to pry.<br> It's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood.<br>" Okay, you want the dirt? Albie was seriously insecure.<br> He was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.<br> Who's intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize? A guy who won two.<br> Two? What? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart? Yeah, for three years.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Have you ever dated someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize? No.<br> But there was my first boyfriend, Billy.<br> Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him? No, but he did just win a MacArthur "genius grant.<br>" What a loser.<br> Some more wine? Hey, Ross.<br> How's it going with Charlie? Oh, great.<br> After I finish my wine I'm gonna blow my average-sized brains out.<br> What's the matter? She only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners.<br> Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant earlier today I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.<br> I always loved that.<br> Of course you would! Your brains are smaller than mine! I can't compete with the guys she goes out with.<br> They're so out of my league.<br> Oh, my God! - Worse? - Oh, much, much worse.<br> I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians.<br> "Can we walk?" - Oh, you like that? - No.<br> What? Come on! I think that's funny! Woolly mammoth.<br> It's good! I bet you're thinking that now would be a great time for an intermission, huh? Oh, yes.<br> God, yes.<br> Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life, there are no intermissions, people! Now, Chapter 7: Divorce is a Four-Letter Word! How could he leave me?! I don't know.<br> You seem lovely.<br> Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.<br> Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.<br> - Nice to meet you.<br> - So, what show are you on? I'm not an actor.<br> I'm a professor of paleontology.<br> That's science.<br> Hey, well, listen, I play a scientist on "Days.<br>" Yeah, my character just won a Nobel Prize.<br> Dirk was wondering about the woman you brought and if you two are together? Well, no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.<br> Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.<br> I'd lead with that.<br> That's it.<br> Just sign right on the bra.<br> Monica! Don't worry, Joe.<br> I won't come next year! What the? What do you got there? Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.<br> Oh, really? Let me see.<br> Damn, that's a lot of guys.<br> Are you a little slutty? I think I am.<br> Let me see if I approve of any of these clowns.<br> - This guy wears a rug.<br> - Well This guy's Canadian.<br> Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay? Lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three, and I don't feel any different.<br> Pass.<br> Pa Oh, pass.<br> Pass.<br> - Why? What's wrong with these guys? - Well, nothing major.<br> It's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you and you deserve the best.<br> Joey, you're so sweet.<br> It's true, but it doesn't matter.<br> I already know who you're going home with.<br> Who? Me.<br> What? Really? Yeah, because we live together.<br> It's a joke! It's a joke.<br> Right! That's funny! I get it! - Got you! - You're funny, Joey.<br> Oh, my God.<br> So how did you enjoy the play? Oh, my God.<br> Honey, I am so, so, so, so sorry.<br> You should be.<br> You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.<br> - You really liked it? - Oh, yeah.<br> I mean, at first I hated it.<br> But why wouldn't I? Because as a man, I've been trained not to listen! But after Chapter 16: Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle I was uplifted.<br> - Oh, really? - Oh, yeah.<br> I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman.<br> Tell me Tell me about your first period.<br> No! Did somebody sign your bra? So I got it when I was 13.<br> Very difficult.<br> Hey, Ross? So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl? Are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off? What is that? Come on, a piece of paper? It's actually a million-dollar prize.<br> Go, Charlie! But my point is okay, so she dated them, but she also broke up with them.<br> Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Ph.<br>D.<br> Yeah, maybe, and I do have my whole career in front of me.<br> I mean I could still win a Nobel Prize.<br> Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.<br> You're so much more than just brains.<br> You are sweet and kind and funny.<br> And sexy.<br> Okay, well, give her a chance to see all that.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> You're right.<br> - Thanks.<br> I'm gonna go find her.<br> - Good for you.<br> Your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian Era was topnotch.<br> Stop going through my stuff! I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind.<br> I'm gonna do it.<br> I'm gonna kiss Joey.<br> No! You can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.<br> Please! What about you and Chandler? That's different.<br> I was drunk and stupid.<br> Well, hello? What about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from? - Why don't you just kiss one of them.<br> - I could but I don't want to.<br> I want to kiss Joey.<br> All right.<br> I think it's a big mistake, but it's your decision.<br> I'm gonna do it.<br> - And I can't stop you? - No.<br> Hey, Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? I'm smarter than him! Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.<br> This was a really important experience for me.<br> I wanted to share it with you.<br> You're so wonderful.<br> Why Don 't You Like Me? Chapter 1: My First Period.<br> I can't believe you guys bought that.<br> Enjoy your slow death.<br>   <br>
