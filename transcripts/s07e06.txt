                    			The reason I asked you to brunch.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is because I've been thinking about my maid of honor.<br> Oh, my God.<br> This is it.<br> Oh.<br> I hope it's you.<br> -I hope it's you.<br> -Me too.<br> First of all, I love you both so much.<br> -You're both so important to me.<br> -Blah, blah, blah.<br> Who is it? I was thinking we could come up with a system.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>where we trade off being maid of honor.<br> -Hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine-- -Yes! Oh.<br> Hypothetically.<br> Still.<br> If Phoebe were mine, Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.<br> We all get to do it and no one gets upset.<br> -That's a pretty good idea.<br> -I'll do that.<br> So, who's yours? Well, that's the best part.<br> You guys get to decide.<br> -Why is that the best part? -I don't have to.<br> Of course we'll help you decide.<br> We'll do anything we can to help you.<br> I'd like to make a toast.<br> To the future Mrs.<br> Chandler Bing.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that-- -Really not deciding.<br> -Fine.<br> Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.<br> -You're marrying Chandler Bing? -Yeah.<br> Good luck! Oh, and good luck to you too! What a nice lady.<br> The One With Nap Partners Gelula/SDI Yeah! -Die Hard, still great.<br> -Yep.<br> Let's make it a double feature? What else you rent? Die Hard 2.<br> Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.<br> Well, we'll watch it a second time and it's Die Hard 2.<br> -Joey, we just saw it.<br> -And? It would be cool to see it again! -Yeah! Die Hard! -Die Hard! Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.<br> Is everything okay? Yeah, I just got plans.<br> Well, John McClane had plans.<br> I want to leave before Joey gets all worked up.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and starts calling everybody "bitch.<br> " What are you talking about, bitch? -Hey, Rachel.<br> -Yeah? When I get married, will you be my maid of honor? Really? Oh, my God, Phoebe.<br> I mean I'm just-- Wait a minute.<br> If I'm your maid of honor, that means that you are Monica's.<br> Oh.<br> Well, if that's what you want.<br> No way, Phoebe.<br> I want to be Monica's.<br> -Why does it even matter? -Why does it matter to you? Because this one is now.<br> And it's two of our best friends.<br> And who knows what you're gonna marry.<br> What if I marry Ross? Or Joey? You wouldn't.<br> Okay, look, Rachel.<br> I know you really want to do this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I've never been maid of honor to anyone before.<br> I know you've done it at least twice.<br> -Yeah, but Phoebe-- -Please let me finish.<br> I guess that was it.<br> Okay.<br> Since you've never done it before, you can be Monica's maid of honor.<br> Oh, thank you so much! Yay.<br> I'm gonna marry someone good.<br> Oh, I know.<br> Better than Chandler.<br> -What happened? -I don't know.<br> We fell asleep.<br> That is all.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah? Yeah.<br> All right, well, I'd better go.<br> -I think that would be best.<br> -Yeah.<br> -I'll talk to you later.<br> -Okay.<br> -But not about this.<br> -No, never.<br> Never! -Bye.<br> -No touch.<br> No touch.<br> Hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.<br> This woman overheard that I was marrying you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and she wished me good luck.<br> That's sweet.<br> No, it was more like a "good luck.<br> " So, what did this woman look like? She was, like, 30, dark hair, attractive.<br> Any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror? Was it someone you dated in college? No, I only dated two girls in college.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>both blond, both not attractive.<br> Let me check this out.<br> -What are you doing? -Well, let's see.<br> Okay, is that her? Oh, my God, yes! -Who is she? -Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.<br> Did you break up with her? No, we're still together.<br> We went out for two summers and then I broke up with her.<br> -Why? -She came back the third summer.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and she'd gotten really fa-- -Fat? -I did not say fat.<br> I said fa-- You broke up with a girl because she was fat? Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> But it was a really long time ago.<br> Does she still feel bad? Apparently she does.<br> You know what they say: "Elephants never forget.<br> " Seriously, good luck marrying me.<br> Hey, what's going on? She's Monica's maid of honor.<br> Hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs.<br> You have been maid of honor before? You see? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie.<br> That's it.<br> I am maid of honor.<br> -No, I am.<br> -How come you are? Because I cared enough to lie.<br> Hey, I could help you decide who should do it.<br> We could have an audition.<br> See how you'd handle maid-of-honor-type situations.<br> -What do you mean? -When I want a job.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I audition and if I'm the best of the people they see.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I get the part.<br> So, okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it? Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.<br> -It's better than us deciding.<br> -Oh, this is crazy.<br> -Can't we just flip a coin? -No, coins hate me.<br> Okay, fine.<br> You know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.<br> Hi! Ross, sweetie.<br> Hey there, handsome thing.<br> Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Giorgio.<br> Hey.<br> Just brought back your videos.<br> Hey, Ross.<br> Look, I think we need to talk about before.<br> No.<br> No, we don't.<br> Yes, we do.<br> Now, look.<br> That was the best nap I ever had.<br> I don't know what you're talking about.<br> Come on, admit it.<br> That was the best nap you ever had.<br> I've had better.<br> Okay.<br> When? All right! All right! It was the best nap ever! I said it, okay? But it's over, Joey! I want to do it again.<br> We can't do it again.<br> -Why not? -Because it's weird! Fine.<br> You want a drink? -Sure.<br> What do you got? -Warm milk and Excedrin PM.<br> Chandler.<br> I just figured out who you are.<br> Can you figure out what I'm doing? -You're Louis Posen.<br> -Who? He was my best friend in fifth grade.<br> One day, I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no.<br> Do you know why? Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom? No, but because he thought I was too fa-- Every time I think about it, I feel as bad as I did then.<br> I really think you should apologize to Julie.<br> Honey, are you kidding? That was like 1 6 years ago.<br> It would make me feel better if Louis apologized to me.<br> I'll do it.<br> But I warn you, this may make me a better person.<br> And that is not the man you fell in love with.<br> Okay, we'll give you hypothetical maid-of-honor situations.<br> You'll be scored on a scale of one to ten.<br> -One being the highest.<br> -Ten is the highest.<br> -Why is 1 0 the highest? -Because it's the highest.<br> Okay, Rachel, you're up first.<br> Situation number one: You're with Monica.<br> The wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet.<br> Go! I don't want to marry Chandler.<br> -I've got cold feet.<br> -It's gonna be okay.<br> One man the rest of my life? I don't know.<br> This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.<br> Look, Monica.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>getting cold feet is very common.<br> It's just because of all the anticipation.<br> And you just have to remember that you love Chandler.<br> And also, I ran out on a wedding.<br> You don't get to keep the gifts.<br> Drawing on your own experience.<br> Very good.<br> Yes, very nice, Rachel.<br> Thank you, judges.<br> -Kiss ass.<br> -Oh.<br> -Okay, Phoebe.<br> -Yes, Your Honor.<br> We're now in the ceremony.<br> Monica is about to say, "I do" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>when her drunk uncle starts yelling.<br> What do you do? Go! When Monica was a little girl.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I remember that-- Ow! -Very good! -Oh.<br> Yes, excellent.<br> Perfect score.<br> She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony! Hey, you want a little taste of Pheebs? It is time for you to give your maid-of-honor speech.<br> We haven't even prepared-- -Go! -Okay, okay, okay.<br> Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as-- Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks! Okay, never mind.<br> Forget it.<br> I met-- I met Monica when we were just a couple of 6-year-olds.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and became friends with Chandler when he was 25.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>although he seemed like a 6-year-old.<br> Oh.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> I've known them separately and together.<br> To know them as a couple is to know that you are in the presence of love.<br> So I would like to raise my glass.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to Monica and Chandler.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together.<br> I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.<br> Wow.<br> -Great speech.<br> -Yeah, it really was.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next.<br> Although I really don't see the point.<br> Okay.<br> I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.<br> I remember talking about this day with Rachel.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>while we were showering together, naked.<br> And she's back in the game! Julie.<br> Hi.<br> Chandler Bing.<br> I guess you remember me.<br> Hello, Skidmark.<br> It's a nickname.<br> I'll explain later.<br> It's pretty clear.<br> I owe you a long, overdue apology.<br> I shouldn't have broken up with you because of your weight.<br> That's why you broke up with me? You didn't know that? Well, I guess my work here is done.<br> First of all, I would like to say you both performed very well, okay? You should be proud.<br> And I'd also like to say, in this competition, there are no losers.<br> Well, except Rachel.<br> Damn it! Really? I won.<br> -What? -I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close.<br> -Well, then I demand a recount! -Actually, it wasn't that close.<br> You know what? Your thing was so stupid anyway.<br> We're gonna flip a coin, all right? Heads.<br> What? The coins have finally forgiven me! Know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y shower.<br> Rach, it's gonna be okay.<br> You guys are the best! Boy, I tell you.<br> That judging stuff took a lot out of me.<br> -Yeah? -Yeah.<br> Thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.<br> Why would I care about that? No reason.<br> I'm just saying that.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that's where I'll be.<br> As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself.<br> I think that I'm going to apologize for all the stupid things that I do.<br> Why don't you just stop doing stupid things? -Then you wouldn't have to apologize.<br> -I'd love it if I could do both.<br> All right, I have to ask.<br> What? Will you break up with me if I get fat? What? You broke up with Julie.<br> How much weight did she gain? A hundred and forty-five pounds.<br> In one year? My God, what did she eat? Her family? That's not the point.<br> I know it was a stupid reason to break up with someone, but I was 1 5.<br> Yeah, well, that's not the only time this was an issue.<br> You remember when you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.<br> Wait a minute.<br> -That was totally different.<br> -How? You were not supposed to hear that.<br> I said that behind your back.<br> What if I have babies, okay? I'm gonna look different.<br> I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure you are.<br> You have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.<br> This is one of the things that I can apologize for later.<br> What I mean is, you're Monica.<br> Okay? And I am in love with Monica.<br> Keep going.<br> So you can balloon up or you can shrink down.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I will still love you.<br> Even if I were to shrink down to 2 inches tall? I'd carry you around in my pocket.<br> I love you.<br> Skidmark still got a way with the ladies.<br> Hi, Pheebs.<br> -Hi.<br> -Hi.<br> I just want to apologize.<br> I'm really sorry I was a baby.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> Rachel, we were all babies once.<br> Oh, you mean today.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.<br> And I was thinking about it.<br> If you're Monica's maid of honor, I get to be yours.<br> -Oh, yeah.<br> -Yeah.<br> When Monica and Chandler got engaged, I put some stuff together.<br> -Just in case.<br> -Oh, that's so sweet.<br> Thanks.<br> Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves.<br> Oh, God, this is funny.<br> Look.<br> Here's a picture from one Halloween when she dressed up as a bride.<br> She made me carry her train.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>which was weird because I was Wonder Woman.<br> Oh, and here's a little purse that I found.<br> I just thought they could hold the rings in there.<br> -Oh.<br> -Something.<br> And.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>vintage handkerchiefs, you know, because people cry at weddings.<br> I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.<br> This stuff is great.<br> I forgot this was in here.<br> This was the garter that I was saving for my wedding.<br> And I wanted it to be Monica's "something borrowed.<br> " And it's blue.<br> Rach, I think that you should be Monica's maid of honor.<br> You do? -Why? -Because I think it means more to you.<br> But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.<br> It's fine.<br> I mean, this is something.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that you've been thinking about since you were, what, 1 4? No, I was 1 0.<br> I just developed early.<br> Man alive! -Hey, what's going on? -Hey! We decided Rachel is going to be your maid of honor.<br> Oh, that's great! Oh, wow.<br> Okay, we really have to start planning.<br> I have really specific ideas.<br> We should meet four times a week.<br> Come to my place, we'll get together before work.<br> What do you say, 6:30, my place? So excited! Yeah, okay.<br> You laugh now.<br> She's gonna be yours.<br> Great nap.<br> It really was.<br> What the hell are you doing? God! Excuse me.<br>   <br>
