                    			Come in.<br> I've been waiting for you.<br> Hi, I just Oh, my God! Monica! Oh, my God! I'm sorry! I was I was taking a nap.<br> Since when do you take naps in that position? Tell me you were waiting for a guy.<br> Please tell me.<br> Yes, I was.<br> A guy.<br> From work.<br> I'm seeing a guy from work! That cute waiter guy that looks like a nonthreatening Ray Liotta? That one! Give me a second.<br> I'm just going to grab a jacket.<br> When I get back, I want every little detail.<br> Maybe that's him.<br> It's just Joey and Ross.<br> Why aren't you at the movie? Ross was so loud, they threw us out.<br> I had to talk loud because the movie was loud! -He's talking to London.<br> -Did he get in touch with Emily? No, not yet.<br> He's hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.<br> I don't care if I said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit! Way to suck up to the family! I'm so glad you're all here.<br> My office finally got wrinkle-free fax paper! The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS Hi, is this Nanny Hopkins? I'm looking for Emily.<br> Waltham.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Is this 0-1-1-4-4-7-4-2 9-3-4-7-4-2-6-7? Oh, it's "4-3," not 4-2.<br> Well, which 4-2? No, no! Vomit tux! Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.<br> Vomit tux? Who vomited on? You know what? What you up to, Joe? They're doing this telethon thing on TV.<br> And my agent got me a job as cohost! That's great! A little good deed for PBS, plus some TV exposure.<br> That's the kind of math Joey likes to do.<br> Oh, PBS! -What's wrong with PBS? -What's right with them? Why don't you like PBS? Right after my Mom killed herself, I was in a bad place, personally.<br> I thought I'd write to Sesame Street.<br> Because they were nice when I was a little kid.<br> No one ever wrote back.<br> A lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.<br> All I got was a lousy key chain, and by that time, I was living in a box.<br> I didn't have keys! I'm sorry, Phoebe.<br> I wanted to do a good deed, like you did with the babies.<br> This isn't a good deed.<br> You just want to get on TV.<br> This is selfish.<br> What about you having those babies for your brother? That's selfish! What are you talking about? It was a nice thing, but it made you feel good, right? Yeah, so? It made you feel good so that makes it selfish.<br> Look, there's no unselfish good deeds.<br> Sorry.<br> Yes, there are totally good deeds that are selfless! May I ask for one example? Yeah, it's You know, there's No, you may not! Because all people are selfish.<br> Are you calling me selfish? Are you calling you people? Sorry to burst that bubble, Phoebe, but selfless good deeds don't exist.<br> You know the deal on Santa Claus? I'll find a selfless good deed.<br> I'm going to beat you, you evil genius! Oh, my God! It's Emily! It's Emily, everyone! I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives.<br> Goodbye.<br> You can hang up, but I'll keep calling everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me.<br> Really? About what? Look, you're my wife.<br> We're married.<br> You know, I love you.<br> I really miss you.<br> I miss you too.<br> At least, I think I do.<br> She's talking.<br> When you said "the deal with Santa," you meant? That he doesn't exist.<br> Right.<br> Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend? Yeah, she might have mentioned him.<br> So, Mon, when are we going to meet this new, secret waiter man? I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.<br> Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.<br> I want to meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had.<br> Really? That's what you heard? You said that? I might have.<br> Why is that funny? Because I'm very happy for him.<br> And you! You lucky dog! She's willing to work on the relationship.<br> That's great! In London.<br> She wants me to move to London.<br> But you live here.<br> You know that.<br> -What will you do? -I don't know.<br> -I mean, I can't leave Ben.<br> -You can just video-conference with him.<br> I'm not ready to have a child.<br> I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan I could convince them to move to London with Ben.<br> I'm sure your ex-wife would be more than happy to move so you can patch things up with your new wife.<br> It could happen.<br> Ross, we are not moving to London.<br> We already have lives here.<br> But it'd be great.<br> They have great theater great accents.<br> Tea.<br> They have a queen.<br> -So? -She's a woman.<br> -Daddy! -Hey! Guess what? We're moving to London! -Who's going to London? -Nobody's going to London.<br> Welcome to London, governor.<br> Right, right.<br> It'll be great because we'll have Big Ben and little Ben in the same city.<br> Go pack! See? See, he wants to go.<br> Yeah, we leave all our big decisions to the 3-year-old.<br> Come on, come on.<br> It'll be just like Three's Company only there's a kid and my wife and you're the gay ones.<br> How you doing? Welcome.<br> Good to see you.<br> This'll be your phone.<br> That's great.<br> But I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.<br> No, you answer it and take pledges.<br> But I'm the host.<br> Gary Collins is the host.<br> You'll be answering the phone.<br> You don't seem to understand.<br> I was Dr.<br> Drake Ramoray.<br> Well, here's your phone, doctor.<br> I can't believe I can't find a selfless good deed.<br> You know that old guy that lives next to me? I snuck over there and raked up the leaves on his front stoop.<br> But he caught me, and he force-fed me cider and cookies.<br> Then I felt wonderful.<br> That old jackass! Maybe Joey's right.<br> Maybe all good deeds are selfish.<br> I will find a selfless good deed.<br> I gave birth to three children and I won't let them be raised in a world where Joey's right! Can I ask you a cooking question? If you're cooking on the stove that means your new boyfriend is better in bed than Richard? Is he? I think I'll respect the privacy of my new, secret boyfriend.<br> Why? If this guy was me and it's me who'd learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had I'd be like this: All right, Emily.<br> As much as I love you I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.<br> I understand that would be difficult.<br> Would you consider moving here? You were moving here anyway.<br> Why can't you just do that? I don't know.<br> It's just But I know that even though I've been a complete idiot up till now you have to come here.<br> You have to, so we can work this out together.<br> All right.<br> Did you just say "all right"? I did.<br> Now I'm the idiot.<br> Emily, that is so great! It'll be great! We're going to be like two idiots in love! There's one thing that really scares me still.<br> -Yes, tell me.<br> -You must understand how humiliating it was for me at the altar in front of my family and friends.<br> I know.<br> I am so sorry.<br> And then, after deciding to forgive you seeing you at the airport, catching our plane with her.<br> Again, very sorry.<br> I mean, I can't be in the same room as her.<br> It drives me mad thinking of you being in the same room as her.<br> Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me.<br> I love you.<br> All right.<br> I'll come to New York, and we'll try to make this work.<br> That's so great! As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.<br> I asked Emily if she would come to New York.<br> And she said yes.<br> Great! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.<br> What? You can't What did you say? I'd think about it.<br> How am l supposed to make this decision? I'm actually asking you! Rachel is one of your best friends.<br> But Emily's his wife! That's true! You can't just cut Rachel out of your life! That's true! Thanks for the help.<br> Problem solved! When will you be on TV? There was kind of a mix-up in my agent's office but I'm still on TV, and that's good exposure.<br> You're not on TV.<br> How about now? There he is! Hello, New York! Maybe just put the whole duck in there.<br> Who cares? Now I got the legs.<br> How many times have I told you to never watch the cooking channel? I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed.<br> That was yours? We used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.<br> Williams-Sonoma, fall catalog, page 27.<br> Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.<br> Joey's at the telethon for the rest of the day.<br> We have the place to ourselves.<br> Yeah, so? Maybe you'd want to book some time with "the best you've ever had.<br>" You know what, champ? I think I'll pass.<br> Why? What's your point? With all the stupid gloating, would you want to sleep with you? Well, I think I'd be a little out of my league, but I'd give it a shot.<br> PBS Telethon.<br> I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed.<br> I went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.<br> What good is that going to do? It helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends.<br> The bee is happy, and I am definitely not.<br> You know, the bee probably died after he stung you.<br> Damn it! Back on in 30 seconds, people! Excuse me, would you mind switching with me? No way.<br> I'm in the shot, man.<br> -You've been here all day! -I'm taking pledges.<br> And we're on three, two.<br> Welcome back to our fall telethon.<br> If you've been enjoying Cirque du Soleil and you'd like to see more, it's very simple.<br> All you have to do is call in a pledge and tell one of our volunteers what type of programming you -Quick broiling pan question -Yes, it really does cost that much.<br> Maybe next time your duck can puke in something from Pottery Barn.<br> That's it.<br> I cannot make this decision.<br> It is too difficult.<br> I leave it entirely up to the gods of fate.<br> A Magic 8 Ball? You can't make this decision with a toy! It's not a toy.<br> I don't know what else to do! I either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends or I get divorced for the second time before I'm 30.<br> If anyone else has a better suggestion, let's hear it.<br> Because I got nothing! Don't be shy.<br> Any suggestion will do.<br> Okay, then.<br> Here we go.<br> Magic 8 Ball should I never see Rachel again? "Ask Again Later.<br>" Later is not good enough! "Ask Again Later.<br>" What the hell? This is broken! It is broken! Let me see.<br> Will Chandler have sex tonight? "Don't Count On lt.<br>" Seems like it works to me.<br> Okay, one more time.<br> Should I never see Rachel again? Magic 8 Ball! What did you ask? Does Rachel get to pick the movie that we're all going to see tonight? Excellent.<br> What's the answer? Looks like Stella's gonna get her groove back tonight! What? I heard it was good.<br> PBS Telethon.<br> Hi, Joey.<br> Hey, Phoebe.<br> I'd like to make a pledge.<br> I would like to donate $200.<br> Two hundred dollars? You sure? After what Sesame Street did to you? I'm still mad at them, but they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves.<br> By supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it.<br> So there! A selfless good deed.<br> You don't feel good about donating the money? No, it sucks! I was saving up to buy a hamster.<br> A hamster? Those things are, like, $10.<br> Not the one I had my eye on.<br> It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total.<br> Thank you! And the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers.<br> Oh, boy! And may I say, one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.<br> Mr.<br> Joseph Tribbiani! Oh, look! Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! That makes me feel so Oh, no! Look I got carried away before, but there's something you got to know.<br> If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.<br> Keep talking.<br> I was nothing before you.<br> Call the other girls and ask.<br> Which wouldn't take long.<br> But when I'm with you, and we're together oh, my God! -Really? -Oh, my God! I understand if you never want to sleep with me again.<br> But that would be wrong.<br> We're too good.<br> We owe it to sex! If we owe it! Oh, my! When will Joey be home? I was kind of hoping we could do this without him.<br> No, no, no! Leave the gloves on.<br> I cleaned the bathroom.<br> Why don't we lose the gloves.<br> All right.<br> Let's show them how it's done.<br> -You know that wasn't part of it? -I know.<br> You ready? We're going to be late.<br> -For what? -For Stella, remember? She's getting her groove back in 20 minutes.<br> I totally forgot about that.<br> Can I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.<br> Sure, I guess.<br> I hear you don't have to go to London.<br> It's not that easy.<br> There's still a lot of relationship stuff.<br> Like what? Just stuff.<br> You know, kind of what Emily wants.<br> Talk to me.<br> Maybe I can help.<br> You can't help.<br> I have to do this without your help.<br> I know you can do that too.<br> I'm just saying if you need to talk.<br> Thanks.<br> Whatever it is that Emily wants just give it to her.<br> The bottom line is that you love her.<br> Fix whatever she wants fixed.<br> Just do it.<br> You're going to have to try.<br> You'll hate yourself if you don't.<br> Come on, answer it! Hi, sweetie.<br> Good.<br> Yes, I've been thinking about that thing you wanted me to do.<br> I can do it.<br> Will you come to New York? -Never done that before.<br> -Nope.<br>   <br>
