Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross! - Hey, Ross.<br> - Hey, Joey.<br> - Hey, you.<br> - Hey, you.<br> And he brought flowers! Thanks, Ross.<br> I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.<br> You're weird today.<br> Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something.<br> Yeah.<br> Actually, I kind of need to talk to you too.<br> - Joey, could you give us a minute? - No.<br> - What? - I'm sorry.<br> I meant, "No.<br>" Hi.<br> Hey, look who's here.<br> Where's my granddaughter? I've been practicing my magic tricks.<br> He pulled a quarter out of my ear.<br> - Hey, where's Mom? - She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.<br> Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get $5 each! So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this: Okay, wow.<br> Emma's in the nursery.<br> I'll take you now if you want.<br> - But I really want to talk to you.<br> - I know.<br> I still need to talk to you.<br> But before you guys do that, I need to talk to you.<br> And, Ross, I need to talk to you.<br> - And I need to talk to you.<br> - About what? To see if you know what these guys are talking about.<br> The One Where No One Proposes mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Isn't she beautiful? Look at her, my first grandchild.<br> What about Ben? Well, of course, Ben.<br> I meant my first granddaughter.<br> Have you thought any more about you and Rachel? Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her when you guys came in the room.<br> That's so exciting! Wow.<br> You could've done that with us there.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> - Sure.<br> Okay.<br> You can touch yourself in front of us, but you can't talk to Rachel.<br> What? When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys? Oh, please.<br> Just before, when you were asleep in the lounge.<br> That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV.<br> That reminds me.<br> That Mr.<br> Hazmegian still has my Game Boy.<br> - Chandler, can I talk to you for a second? - Sure.<br> Dude, I just did something terrible.<br> That was you? I thought it was Jack.<br> No, no.<br> That was Jack.<br> Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.<br> - What? Why does she think that? - Because it kind of looked like I did.<br> Again, what? Okay, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand As we all are at some point during the day.<br> It wasn't my ring.<br> It fell out of Ross' jacket and when I knelt down to pick it up, Rachel thought I was proposing.<br> Ross had a ring? And he was gonna propose? - I guess.<br> - And you did it first? This is gonna kill him.<br> You know how much he loves to propose.<br> I know.<br> I know.<br> It's awful.<br> Well, what did she say? She said, "Yes.<br>" Does Ross know? Oh, my God.<br> What the hell am I gonna tell him? - Maybe you don't have to tell him.<br> - I like that.<br> Yeah.<br> If you clear things up with Rachel, Ross never needs to find out.<br> But you have to do it before he hears about it and kicks your ass.<br> All right, let's not get carried away.<br> I want a baby.<br> Honey, we've been over this.<br> I need to be facing the other way.<br> If we have sex again, it'll double our chances of getting pregnant.<br> - I think that closet's still available.<br> - I am so tired.<br> - Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.<br> - Deal! Dad, seriously! You know, you really should see someone about that.<br> Noted.<br> I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.<br> Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit? Are you kidding me? I could stay and look at her forever.<br> Actually - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> Are you all right? - I think I just got engaged.<br> - Oh, my God! He did it? What? Did you know he was gonna ask me? Are you kidding? I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.<br> I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.<br> - And you really think this is a good idea? - I just talked him into it.<br> Don't tell me I have to do you too? - The puppet master gets tired, people.<br> - Okay.<br> I don't know.<br> It just doesn't feel right.<br> Why? You two are so meant to be together.<br> Everybody thinks so.<br> Really? Even Ross? Especially Ross.<br> Hey, Pheebs.<br> You know what? I'll come back later.<br> Wow.<br> Kind of a full house here.<br> I guess I'll just I'll come back.<br> There he goes.<br> Your fiance.<br> I guess so.<br> Although he does play with himself in his sleep.<br> I can't say I'm surprised.<br> - Dad, what are you doing? - There are people in there having sex.<br> It can't be me.<br> I'm standing right here.<br> - Wanna peek? - No! Come on.<br> You know what? I don't like you without Mom.<br> Come on.<br> We're not peeking? Well, I'm peeking.<br> Oh, my God! Hello, sir.<br> You know Monica.<br> - Hey, is it okay to come in? - Of course.<br> Joey, this ring, l It's beautiful.<br> I love it.<br> Yeah.<br> Look, Rach, there's something I gotta tell you.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> - Are you ready to try nursing again? - Yeah.<br> Hi, Emma.<br> Why do you think she won't take my breast? It's all right.<br> It takes babies a while to get it.<br> - But don't worry, it'll happen.<br> - Okay.<br> Okay, sweetie, you can do it.<br> Just open up and put it in your mouth.<br> Dear Lord.<br> - I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying? - Yeah, look, I think that Because, look! She's pulling away again.<br> Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared.<br> Doesn't she look scared? You know, I don't really know her.<br> Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow? - Okay.<br> - Are you kidding me? This is so frustrating.<br> Why doesn't she want my breast? I don't know! Maybe she's crazy! - Hey, wait up.<br> - Hi.<br> Congratulations.<br> I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey.<br> I didn't know if he knew.<br> What? That we had a baby? Now let's give him a little credit.<br> Although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.<br> No, no, that you and Rachel are engaged.<br> - What? - Oh, it's a secret? Goody.<br> Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.<br> Phoebe, there is no secret, okay? I didn't propose.<br> Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us you were a doctor? I am a doctor! You know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.<br> All right.<br> Well, me too.<br> - Well, should we wake her up? - No.<br> No.<br> Come on, let her sleep.<br> - She's so exhausted.<br> - And so engaged.<br> Oh, my God.<br> She thinks we're engaged! Why? Why, why would she think we're engaged? Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? You know, Ross, doctors are supposed to be smart.<br> - I didn't give her that ring.<br> - You didn't? - No! - So whose ring is it? It's mine.<br> - Is it an engagement ring? - Yes.<br> - But you didn't give it to her? - No.<br> - But you were going to propose? - No! I might be losing interest in this.<br> Look.<br> Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel.<br> But all I wanted to do was see if she maybe, kind of wanted to start things up again.<br> What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.<br> I didn't want to rush into anything.<br> It seemed like she didn't want to either.<br> But I don't understand how any of this happened.<br> What, did she find the ring in my jacket, assume I was gonna propose throw it on and just start telling people? No, no.<br> She said you actually proposed to her.<br> Well, I didn't! I didn't propose! Unless Did I? I haven't slept in 40 hours and It does sound like something I would do.<br> Look, we can't stay in here forever.<br> It's just, I still can't believe that my dad saw us having sex.<br> He didn't make it to one of my piano recitals, but this he sees! This is okay.<br> We're all adults here.<br> There's nothing to be ashamed of.<br> Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.<br> Hi, Dad.<br> - I can still call you that, right? - Of course.<br> I'll always be your dad.<br> I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.<br> - It wasn't fun? - Why, why, why would you? Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.<br> Well, I don't think that.<br> Before today, I never thought of you two having sex at all.<br> It was a simpler time.<br> The truth is, Dad, we're trying.<br> - What? - Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.<br> Oh, my God, this is so exciting.<br> Well, get back in there! I'll guard the door! That's okay, Dad, we can wait until later.<br> Whoa! I don't think so.<br> Aren't you ovulating? Daddy! You gotta get at it, princess.<br> When your mother and I were trying to conceive you whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it! That's how I got my bad hip.<br> That's funny.<br> This conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.<br> This one time I had my knee on the sink, and your mother was Daddy, I don't think we need to hear the specific positions you and Mom had.<br> You're right.<br> This is about your positions.<br> Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child.<br> - Although it might feel good.<br> - I don't feel good right now.<br> But pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.<br> You up to the task, sailor? Seriously, sir, my brains, all over the wall.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> Oh, I need to tell you something.<br> Well, now's a good time.<br> I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.<br> Joey asked me to marry him.<br> - What? - Joey proposed to me.<br> - Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby! - Well, I said yes.<br> What, are you crazy? You just had Ross' baby! It's so inappropriate.<br> No, it is worse than that.<br> It is wrong.<br> It is bigger than mine! I know.<br> "Days of our Lives", thank you very much.<br> - You can't marry him.<br> - Why not? Come on, I don't want to do this alone, and he's such a sweet guy.<br> And he loves me so much.<br> Well, do you love him? Sure.<br> - Sure? - Yeah, I mean, whatever.<br> Honey, the question is do you really want to marry Joey? No.<br> No, I don't.<br> Could you be a dear and go tell him? You still haven't told Rachel you weren't proposing? No.<br> She had the ring on she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.<br> Joey, you have to tell her what's going on.<br> And what did it look like? I didn't look at it.<br> The stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.<br> Go and tell Rachel right now, before Ross finds out.<br> Look, it's not that easy.<br> She said she wanted to marry me.<br> I don't want to hurt her.<br> Okay, look, just do it gently.<br> You're right.<br> You're right.<br> I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.<br> I can do that.<br> I am a gentle person.<br> By the way, two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> Listen, I heard about the engagement.<br> Surprised? And confused.<br> Rach, sweetie I didn't propose to you.<br> I know.<br> I don't think you do.<br> You didn't propose to me.<br> Joey did.<br> Poor baby, you're so tired.<br> Rach, I didn't propose to you.<br> Joey didn't propose to you.<br> And Chandler didn't propose to you.<br> You didn't propose to me.<br> Chandler didn't propose to me.<br> But Joey did.<br> Joey proposed to you? - I can come back.<br> - Wait.<br> Wait.<br> Wait.<br> - Joey, did you propose to her? - No.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> - Actually, technically, I didn't.<br> - Well, then, why did you give me a ring? - Wait.<br> - You gave her the ring? - No, and I did not ask her to marry me.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> Yes, you did, and don't you say you didn't! He was right there.<br> He got down on one knee and he proposed.<br> - You were down on one knee? - Yeah, that looks bad.<br> But I didn't propose.<br> - Then what did happen? - Yeah, what did happen? Okay, the ring fell on the floor, and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.<br> Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?" - No, I didn't.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> Oh, my God, you didn't.<br> - Why didn't you tell me that before? - Well, I tried but people kept coming in, and then you took your breast out.<br> You saw her breast? I'll tell you about it later.<br> Be cool.<br> Then what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring? It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.<br> That's why I felt so bad, Rach, because he was gonna propose.<br> What?! You were gonna propose to me? No.<br> Well, this is awkward.<br> But I was going to see if, you know, maybe you wanted to start dating again.<br> - But that, I mean, that was all, Rach.<br> - Dude, step up.<br> I proposed.<br> No, you didn't.<br> That's right.<br> There's a lot going on here, and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.<br> Hey, she just woke up.<br> She's hungry.<br> Why don't we give this another try? I can't believe you told her I was gonna propose.<br> - I can't believe you're not gonna.<br> - Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.<br> Yeah, dude, I totally understand.<br> Usually after I have a baby with a woman, I like to slow things down! - Oh, my God! - What? She's doing it! She's breast-feeding! It's beautiful.<br> - I'll come back for her later.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Wow, this feels weird.<br> - What, good weird? Wonderful weird.<br> You know what, you guys? I'm gonna go too.<br> And I'm sorry about everything.<br> - Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.<br> - No, Rach, I should've told you sooner.<br> It's just that Man, that kid is going to town! She's perfect.<br> We're so lucky.<br> We really are.<br> Look, I know it's not a proposal, and I don't know where you are but with everything that's been going on and with Emma, I'm - I've been feeling - Yeah, I know.<br> I've been feeling - Yeah? - Yeah.<br> Okay, well, that Wow, okay, well Then maybe at least we can talk about us again? Yeah.<br> Maybe.<br> Well, good.<br> Okay.<br> I kind of think, you know, if we, if You're wearing the ring.<br> What's that? And you told Phoebe you were engaged.<br> I'm sorry, what? When you thought Joey proposed did you say yes? Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.<br> - Hey, Dad.<br> - Hi.<br> Sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back? Thank you.<br>   <br>
