                    			She is the star of the play, and she is my girlfriend.<br> I get to have sex with the star of the play! -People can hear you.<br> -I know! She looks great, doesn't she? That is one good-looking man.<br> Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat? So you been doing this long? No.<br> You're my first.<br> Put the money on the table.<br> That's nice.<br> Dude! -ls that an expensive blouse? -lf you want it to be.<br> Here's your girlfriend's button.<br> The One with Rachel's Crush Do you still have your old blouses and dresses from high school? Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere.<br> Why? Maternity clothes are so expensive.<br> Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.<br> If you could just throw your purses at it.<br> Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.<br> Are you out of a job? No, but they stuck me in Personal Shopping, which is a huge step down.<br> What is that? Where you walk around with rich people and tell them what to buy? That sounds great! We switched apartments.<br> You can't eat our food.<br> That gravy train has ended.<br> There's gravy? If you have the big apartment, you have to deal with people coming over.<br> That fridge has to be stocked.<br> That's your apartment now.<br> -What are you doing? -I think I left a doughnut up here.<br> How was Kathy's play? Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good-looking guy.<br> It's like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it.<br> That's a good idea for a business.<br> I'm totally screwed.<br> They're gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night then they'll go to their cast parties, and he's gonna try to undermine me.<br> He'll be like, "Where's your boyfriend? What's his name? Chester?" She'll go, "It's Chandler.<br>" He'll go, "Whatever!" That is a good trick.<br> All right, look.<br> What am I going to do? They're actors.<br> They're there to do a job.<br> It doesn't mean they're gonna get together.<br> Just because it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.<br> Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.<br> Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.<br> Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.<br> They're not a couple.<br> I get the game now.<br> All these people were in movies together.<br> It's much different with plays.<br> You were in acting class together, and she slept with you.<br> Acting class is a lot more like a movie than a play.<br> When they were doing it on stage, was it really hot? Oh, yeah.<br> So you're fine.<br> The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage then all the sexual tension between them is gone.<br> As long as it's hot on stage, you got nothing to worry about.<br> When the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.<br> Really? You guys have been to every play I've been in.<br> Have I ever had chemistry on stage? -No.<br> -No! Are you gonna go see the play with me tonight? I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between them.<br> -I know, but -No, I'm there.<br> -Want some pancakes? -You made pancakes? Grab a plate.<br> No, no.<br> Stay right there.<br> Getting closer.<br> Don't worry we also have cereals, muffins, waffles and jams, jellies and marmalades, which I'm sure are the same thing.<br> Please eat, because Joey opened everything.<br> We're watching the game here Saturday night, if people wanna come over.<br> I was thinking about having people over.<br> Yeah? Who's playing? The players.<br> Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.<br> Please.<br> It's a relief, is what it is, is what it is.<br> Pheebs, stick out your plate.<br> Monica, I'm quitting.<br> I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong, and she didn't even buy it.<br> I'm quitting.<br> I'm talking to my boss right now.<br> Yes, I am.<br> Yes, I am.<br> Okay, bye.<br> Call me when you get this message.<br> Mr.<br> Waltham? I really need to talk to you.<br> In a moment, please.<br> I'm in the middle of a task.<br> And you have a customer.<br> Hi.<br> Hi, I'm Joshua.<br> I'm Rachel Greene.<br> What could I do for you, Joshua? I need a whole new wardrobe.<br> My wife Well, my ex-wife I'm so sorry.<br> Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.<br> I got away with this suit and what turned out to be a skirt.<br> Well, at least that's a great suit.<br> It wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.<br> I need everything down to underwear.<br> If you're willing, I'm all yours.<br> Okay.<br> You needed to speak to me? No, no, that wasn't me.<br> We should get started.<br> Let me show you my underwear.<br> The selection of underwear that we carry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> -It's this way.<br> -This way? Sorry.<br> I'm right.<br> Right? There was no chemistry between them.<br> Before, they had heat.<br> Now, there's no heat.<br> You know what this means.<br> Joey told us what this means.<br> Let's not jump to any conclusions.<br> There was some sexual chemistry.<br> Come on.<br> It was like cousins having sex.<br> Here she comes.<br> Don't say a word.<br> Just be cool.<br> Don't be, you know, you.<br> Hey, you guys! Thank you so much for coming again.<br> -Did you like it tonight? -Absolutely.<br> Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit? It's a good play, isn't it? I loved the play.<br> You were great.<br> And Nick, ditto.<br> Clearly, you're having sex with him.<br> Okay.<br> Clearly, I'm having sex with him? It was so obvious.<br> There was no chemistry between you two.<br> You're accusing me of cheating on you, and you're insulting my performance? I can see how this could happen.<br> You're up there every night naked, touching, kissing.<br> Acting.<br> Chandler, this is my job.<br> I'm playing a part in a play.<br> How can you not trust me? You can understand, given how we started.<br> I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.<br> That is what happened.<br> I don't even see you denying this.<br> I'll tell you what, Chandler.<br> You call me when you grow up.<br> Don't expect that to happen any time soon! I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over, and I got to dress him up all day! Rachel has a new doll! I wish he was a doll.<br> I'd get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissing noises.<br> He's got the most beautiful name.<br> I never realized.<br> Joshua.<br> Joshua.<br> Joshua.<br> Josh.<br> Hello? Hi.<br> What do I smell? I don't know.<br> It smells good.<br> Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven.<br> Please, have some.<br> I've been fiddling around here, making delicious treats for everyone.<br> The new Playboy.<br> Just something I picked up.<br> Cookies and porn? You're the best mom ever! What? It's just something Joshua said about V-necks, but you had to be there.<br> How does Jason look in a V-neck? -It's Joshua.<br> -Whatever.<br> Wait.<br> Wait.<br> This isn't takeout! -Hate to eat and run.<br> -No, wait.<br> Please, don't go! I've got porn for you too.<br> I don't need it.<br> People are supposed to want to hang out here.<br> Why? What is the big deal? I'm the hostess.<br> Not those guys.<br> I'm always the hostess.<br> Even when I was little, the girls brought their dollies to my tea party.<br> I served the best air.<br> Why'd you make a big thing out of everyone hanging out in the big apartment? 'Cause they took our apartment.<br> I wanted to punish them.<br> I'm done now.<br> They've suffered enough.<br> If you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here.<br> That is true.<br> This place is gonna be 10 times better than that place.<br> Are we gonna trash their place? There's steps! Slut! You'll all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy! -What? -You were right? I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.<br> I don't live here! Wait, are you sure? I may be drunk, but I know what she said.<br> Then I went over to Beefsteak Chewley's.<br> -Beefsteak Charlie's? -Yes! You and l have always been like: Man, I am so sorry.<br> The bartender taught me a trick, though.<br> I don't remember it.<br> -Do you need help with that? -I got it.<br> I just feel bad.<br> I never vacuum.<br> I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.<br> -Just so frustrating.<br> -Why don't you ask him out? Totally.<br> That's such a turn-on.<br> Really? It doesn't seem desperate? That's the turn-on.<br> He just got a divorce.<br> Right? He's probably really nervous around women.<br> Maybe you just need to make the first move.<br> -I've never asked a guy out before.<br> -You've never asked a guy out? No.<br> Have you? Thousands of times! That doesn't make me sound too good, does it? I don't even know how I would go about it.<br> What I do is, I look a woman up and down, and I say "Hey.<br> How you doing?" Oh, please! Hey.<br> How you doing? You know what? I'm gonna do that.<br> I'm gonna call him up and ask him out.<br> I can do that, ask him out.<br> "How you doing?" Hi, Joshua.<br> It's Rachel Greene from Bloomingdale's.<br> I was just wondering if you? If you Ieft your wallet at the store today? We found a wallet, and we The license? That is a good idea.<br> Well, let's see.<br> This license belongs to belongs to a Mr.<br> Pheebs.<br> So sorry to bother you at home.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Bye.<br> -You've done that a thousand times? -I've never done that.<br> I just got so nervous that he'd say no.<br> You gotta give him something he can't say no to, like Knicks tickets.<br> Invite him to a Knicks game.<br> You're guaranteed he'll say yes.<br> -Really? You think that'll work? -Absolutely.<br> And if not, can I go? What the heck is that? Did she call? No.<br> Sorry.<br> Maybe I should call her.<br> Forget her, man.<br> You don't need her.<br> He's right.<br> What she did was unforgivable.<br> Well, yeah, but, you know, what if I was wrong? How might you be wrong? What if she didn't actually sleep with the guy? Tell me she told you this.<br> She didn't have to tell me.<br> I saw the play.<br> There was no heat.<br> -Back me up.<br> -That's all you're basing this on? That's not backing me up! Look, you said, "With the offstage and the heat" That was just a theory.<br> There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out: Lone gunman, communism, geometry.<br> Oh, my God! "Would you like to go to a basketball game with?" "It's funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets" "Who likes the Knick?" What do you think? Well, as a single woman, who is available I think you look great.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> You look great.<br> This looks great.<br> So you like it? I do.<br> I love it.<br> In fact, I think I'll wear it home.<br> -Great.<br> -Thank you so much for all your help.<br> Well, I guess this is it.<br> Thanks.<br> Maybe I'll see you in the spring for the bathing suits.<br> You don't want to do that now? That's okay.<br> I'll see you around sometime.<br> Basketball! Sorry? I have two tickets to the Knicks game if you're interested just as a thank-you for this week.<br> That would be great! -Really? -That would be fantastic! My nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic.<br> Thank you so much, Rachel.<br> Good morning.<br> I just wanted to come over to say that I'm sorry.<br> I acted like the biggest idiot in the world.<br> I can completely understand why you were so upset.<br> I really wish you'd called me.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> I wish I had too.<br> I think this is a good thing.<br> We've had our first fight, and now we can move on.<br> I know for me, but Nick's pants? I think our second fight is going to be a big one! -For next time, what do you say? -"l have an extra ticket.<br>" "An extra ticket.<br>" Not "two tickets.<br>" The first time you asked a guy out he turned you down? He didn't turn me down.<br> He's at the game.<br> I got the date.<br> I'm just not on it.<br> Okay, it's ready.<br> -Come on.<br> -What's ready? Just come.<br> Oh, my God! This is beautiful! Did you work for two days straight? Pretty much.<br> What do you think of the floor? I don't know.<br> Looks the same.<br> You used to have carpet.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I made snacks.<br> Please, just hang out.<br> I'm just gonna rest my eyes for just a little bit.<br> Do you want us to come back later? No, no, no.<br> Stay.<br> Just keep talking.<br> I'm always the hostess.<br> How'd it go? -She wasn't sleeping with him.<br> -Good! She is now.<br> -What are you saying? -I'm saying that she is a devil woman.<br> You think you know a person, then they turn around and sleep with Nick.<br> Nick and his rock-hard pecs and his giant man-nipples.<br> I hate him.<br> And I hate her.<br> I don't hate her.<br> I love her.<br> This is all my fault.<br> How? How is it your fault? I should have called.<br> If I had called her, she never would have gone out with Nick.<br> They wouldn't have ended up in bed.<br> I threw her at his man-nipples! This is not your fault.<br> Your fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.<br> Well, if she thought they were on a break.<br> Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold, a Joshua Burgen.<br> Really? -Will you call him? -Yes, I will.<br> Absolutely.<br> Hello, Rachel.<br> Hi, Joshua.<br> -I left my wallet here on purpose.<br> -Really? Yes.<br> I just wanted to see you again.<br> I'm glad.<br> Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.<br> Yes? "How you doing?"   <br>
