                    			Six dollars, please.<br> Six? I just had it for one night.<br> It's three.<br> Eight o'clock's the cutoff.<br> And, oh, it's 8:02.<br> You know, in a weird way, you have too much power.<br> You have to help me because I only have three.<br> I can help with that.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Richard? Your lip went bald.<br> Thanks.<br> You look great! Right.<br> No, you do.<br> You.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> What? You got panties stuck to your leg.<br> I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and static cling.<br> Or maybe God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.<br> It's good to see you.<br> It's good to see you too.<br> The One Where Monica and Rich are Just Friends .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) See that guy? He's in "Classics" now.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but as soon as we leave, he's going straight to the porn.<br> He'll go to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.<br> This is nice.<br> -I miss this.<br> -Me too.<br> You want to get a hamburger or something? I don't know if that's a good idea.<br> Just friends.<br> I won't grope you.<br> I promise.<br> I think it's too soon.<br> No, it's not too soon.<br> I had lunch at 1 1 .<br> Yeah, baby! -What are you making? -Chocolate milk.<br> Want some? No, thanks.<br> I'm 29.<br> Oh, my God! I gotta go to work! What time will you get off tonight? It could be really late.<br> Not again! I know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'll make a deal with you, okay? Every night that you're asleep before I get home.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I will wake you up in a way that has proved popular in the past.<br> Well, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.<br> Look at you.<br> Since when do you rollerblade? Since tomorrow.<br> I met a cute guy in the park.<br> And he jogs and blades and swims and so we made a deal.<br> He's gonna teach me how to do jock stuff.<br> -And what are you gonna do for him? -I'm gonna let him.<br> Cool.<br> Good morning.<br> Somebody got in late last night.<br> Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.<br> When did this happen? Around 8:02.<br> We talked for a while, and then we went out for an innocent burger.<br> There's no such thing as an "innocent burger.<br> " -Gonna see him again? -Tomorrow night.<br> Monica, what are you doing? She spent six months getting over him.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.<br> It's not a date, okay? I'm teaching him how to make a lasagna for a potluck dinner.<br> You might want to make extra, because you'll be hungry after the sex.<br> We're not gonna have sex.<br> Nothing's changed here.<br> He still doesn't want children, and I still do.<br> So we're just gonna be friends.<br> Naked friends.<br> -Do you have any ice? -Check the freezer.<br> If there's none in there, we're probably out.<br> Are you just getting home? It's late.<br> I know.<br> I had the greatest day, though.<br> I went to a meeting with reps from Calvin Klein.<br> I liked a line of lingerie, so my boss ordered a ton of it.<br> And you? I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth using just my tongue.<br> Why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer? I was reading it last night and I got scared, so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> But you're safe from it if it's in the freezer? Well, safer.<br> I never start reading it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>without making sure we got room in the freezer.<br> How often do you read it? Haven't you ever read a book over and over again? I read Little Women more than once.<br> It's a classic.<br> What's so great about The Shining? The question should be, what is not so great about The Shining? And the answer would be, "nothing.<br> " All right? This is the scariest book ever.<br> I bet it's better than that classic of yours.<br> We'll just see about that, okay? I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.<br> All right, you got it.<br> Now, Rach, these little women.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> How little are they? I mean, are they, like, scary little? Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.<br> You have lipstick right here.<br> That's okay, it's mine.<br> We just kissed.<br> Isn't it a bit cold out for shorts? Well, I'm from California.<br> Right.<br> Sometimes you guys just burst into flame.<br> I'm up.<br> I'm up.<br> I've gotten up now.<br> Anybody want anything? -I'll have coffee.<br> -Me too.<br> Make that three.<br> Ross, why don't you come with me? What's the matter? What's going on? Robert's coming out.<br> What do you mean? ls he gay? He's coming out of his shorts.<br> What? The man is showing brain.<br> Are you sure? Hold on.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That was a coffee and a.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Coffee.<br> We could write it down.<br> No, no.<br> That won't be necessary.<br> Well? What do we do? What do we do? Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.<br> Like an eclipse.<br> When people compliment my cooking tonight, what do I say? You say, "Thank you.<br> " Then you buy me something pretty.<br> Come on, we're gonna put our hands in this bowl.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.<br> This feels very weird.<br> You touch people's eyeballs and this feels weird? Sure, I touch them.<br> But I spent years learning not to squish them.<br> That's my hand.<br> -Keep squishing.<br> -The tomatoes are squishing.<br> You got some on your shirt.<br> Hold on a second.<br> Just put a little club soda on it.<br> Get to it right away.<br> It should do.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the trick.<br> What? You've got some on your pants.<br> I'll just throw them out.<br> These little women! You're liking it? Oh, yeah.<br> Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.<br> I don't see how he could forgive her.<br> Jo's a girl.<br> It's short for Josephine.<br> But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.<br> You mean it's like a girl-girl thing? That is the one thing missing from The Shining.<br> No, actually, Laurie's a boy.<br> No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.<br> How'd the basketball go? I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.<br> You mean a 3-pointer? I get more because I'm dainty.<br> Is there a phone here to check my messages? -In back.<br> Do you want a quarter? -I always carry one in my sock.<br> What are you doing? Get back on your side-- Hello! I'm Joey.<br> We haven't met.<br> Good to meet you.<br> Robert.<br> What? What? You guys, what is going on? Do you not like Robert? Why are you laughing? Calm down.<br> No reason to get testy.<br> -You guys! Come on! -We're sorry.<br> It just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>as one may have hoped.<br> What do you mean? Could you pass me those cookies? Sure.<br> So how'd the lasagna go over? Really? Good.<br> So you owe me three pretty things.<br> I've been thinking about you too.<br> Well, no.<br> It's hard, this "platonomy" thing.<br> It's a word.<br> I do think it's better this way.<br> We're being smart.<br> Yes, I'm sure.<br> You really sure? I'll call you back.<br> So we can be friends who sleep together.<br> Absolutely.<br> This'll just be something we do.<br> Like racquetball.<br> Sounds smart and healthy to me.<br> So just out of curiosity.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>do you currently have any other "racquetball" buddies? Just your dad.<br> Although that's actually racquetball.<br> You know, I do have a blind date.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>with my sister's neighbor next Tuesday.<br> Do you want me to cancel it? No! Because if you did, that means you'd be canceling for me.<br> -And we're just friends.<br> -Exactly.<br> Oh, don't sit down.<br> -Ready to go? -You bet.<br> And first, here's a gift.<br> Stretchy pants?! The greatest things in the world! lf I were you, I'd wear them every day.<br> Gee, thank you.<br> Really, that's so nice.<br> But, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these.<br> They're so tight.<br> I'd feel like I'm on display.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's all right.<br> I'll figure.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> How's it going? Good.<br> How's The Shining? Danny just went into Room 21 7.<br> The next part's the best! That dead lady in the bathtub-- You're gonna ruin it! I'll talk in code.<br> Remember when the kid sees those two "blanks" in the hallway? Yeah, that's very cool.<br> All "blank" and no "blank" makes "blank" a "blank-blank.<br> " No, the end! Jack almost kills them with the "blank" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but in the last second, they get away.<br> I can't believe you just did that.<br> I can't believe she cracked your code.<br> Okay.<br> Laurie proposes to Jo and she says no.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>even though she's in love with him.<br> Then he ends up marrying Amy.<br> Mine was by accident! The boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad.<br> Beth dies.<br> Beth dies? Is that true? lf I keep reading, is Beth gonna die? No, Beth doesn't die.<br> She doesn't die.<br> Does she, Rachel? He's asking if you've ruined.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson.<br> No.<br> She doesn't die.<br> Then why would you say that? Because I wanted to hurt you.<br> Oh, there they are.<br> I dropped my keys.<br> Got them.<br> Sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You would not believe my day.<br> I had to work two shifts.<br> And then to top it off.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I lost one of my fake boobs in a grill fire.<br> What are you smiling at? I was thinking your day could still pick up.<br> I love this "friend" thing! Robert's gonna be here any second, so could one of you just tell him? Please, right now.<br> Every time I see him, it's "Is it on the loose? ls it watching me?" We can't tell him.<br> You can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his "stuff.<br> " He's right.<br> Even if it's to say something complimentary.<br> You ready for the gym? There's a new rock-climbing wall.<br> We can spot each other.<br> Yeah, I can spot you from here.<br> What? Listen, Robert.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Hey, don't we have to.<br> .<br> .<br>? Yeah, we got.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I think you're really, really great.<br> Oh, God.<br> Here we go again.<br> Why does this keep happening? ls it something I'm putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts? I don't know what to say.<br> Hey, buddy? This is a family place.<br> Put the mouse back in the house.<br> Really? It's just like everyone else's apartment.<br> It's got rooms and walls and ceilings.<br> I just wanted to see where you live.<br> Now give me the tour.<br> Oh, my God! -This is the living room.<br> -That's nice.<br> -And this is the kitchen.<br> -That's real pretty.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Don't I get to see the bedroom? Well, it's pretty much your typical.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>bedroom.<br> We're still on this side of the door.<br> I didn't get to see it.<br> Oh, shoot.<br> Maybe next time.<br> Thanks for a lovely evening.<br> So who is she? That was the blind date I told you about.<br> She called and switched it from Tuesday.<br> Did you like her? I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.<br> Well, you seem fine.<br> Okay, you know what? I'm not fine.<br> I'm not.<br> I mean, how could I be fine? Hearing you come in with her.<br> She wants to see your bedroom.<br> You know what? What if we're friends.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who don't see other people? You mean "exclusive" friends? Why not? I mean, this has been the most amazing week.<br> Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together? Or maybe someday, friends who stood up in front of their other friends.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and vowed to be friends forever.<br> You know, we're back where we were.<br> Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.<br> That's not true.<br> You don't have a moustache.<br> Okay, one thing's changed.<br> But we still want different things, and we know how this is gonna end.<br> You know what? I gotta walk out of here right now.<br> Because getting over you is the hardest thing I have ever had to do.<br> I don't think I could do it again.<br> I know I couldn't.<br> How about one last game of racquetball? Watch the thorns! What? Beth is really, really sick.<br> Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she can do.<br> You wanna put the book in the freezer?   <br>
