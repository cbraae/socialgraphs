See after the scene, Mr.<br> Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.<br> Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.<br> Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks.<br> What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.<br> The one with Barry And Mindy's Wedding Hey, what did your agent say?

I'm afraid I might just be.<br> You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or.<br> It could be a guy.<br> Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.<br> It could be like a big giant guy.<br> Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back.<br> What's going on? We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.<br> Oh, well.<br> Just ask her how long she's gonna live.<br> Women live longer than men.<br> How do you not fall down more? Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?' All right.<br> "My husband is sleeping with his secretary.<br>" She's married! Well at least we know she's a woman.<br> I can't believe she's married.<br> Aw, man I'm sorry.<br> This must be very tough for ya, huh.<br> So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.<br> Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars.<br> - See, we're having fun.<br> - Oh, absolutely.<br> Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not going to be thinking about.<br> Neither am I.<br> Hi, there.<br> Are you all right? Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.<br> Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right.<br> It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.<br> God I know, you're right.<br> All rightie, everybody look at me.<br> Good.<br> All right, its time.<br> Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.<br> Okay, I'll see you after the thing.<br> - Okay, good luck - Thank you Okay, Okay.<br> Why the hell didn't you tell me! I'm sorry.<br> What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!' Yeah, better than you embarrass and I will go.<br> Oh my God this is sooo humiliating.<br> I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school.<br> I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out.<br> Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.<br> Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.<br> Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.<br> Rachel! Oh hi, Mr.<br> Wineburg, hi Mrs.<br> Wineburg.<br> It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.<br> You told me you didn't see anything.<br> I tell ya a lot things! Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.<br> Stay well.<br> Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.<br> Rach! Rach! - Oh my God, I'm married! - I know.<br> I'm Mrs.<br> Dr.<br> Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.<br> Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.<br> Min.<br> Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.<br> Yeah, I love that story.<br> Um, I got a question for you guys.<br> Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about? Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of.<br>insane.<br> Insane! from the syphilis.<br> What?! Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore.<br> Come on.<br> Your choice was that, syphilis? Hey, sweetie, at least they put you Tutsi show under prospective.<br> Angela? Joey Tribiani.<br> Listen, what are ya doing tonight? I know your seeing that guy, I was thinking maybe you could bring him.<br>.<br> Hello? Hello? Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent.<br> - She wants to know what's wrong? - What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.<br> - Oh, my.<br> - What? She wants to meet you in person.<br> Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.<br> What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy.<br> I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.<br> I don't know.<br> Listen, those bingbongs are the woman who loves you.<br> Okay, I'll do it! Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww.<br> No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first.<br> No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.<br> Okay, one more, please.<br> Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.<br> Okay, last chance.<br> Again, I'm sorry.<br> You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.<br> You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry.<br> I just do.<br> Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here.<br> Thank you.<br> I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel What?! What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech.<br> Thank you, thank you very much.<br> Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together.<br> And Rachel - What.<br> - No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that - Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding? Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.<br> Oh dear God.<br> Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.<br> And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.<br> What are you doing I'm serious.<br> Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Rachel, took a lot of courage, doesn't has the syphilis and wild with me.<br> Cheers! - See you in the parking lot.<br> - No, Rach! And once again she is out of here.<br> Okay who had 9:45? Um? Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave.<br> I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings.<br> See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.<br> Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.<br> There's nothing really left to say except.<br> "Her name was Lola.<br> She was a showgirl.<br> With yellow feathers, feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there.<br> She would" - Marenge, - "marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha.<br> And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar.<br> At the, wait, wait, everybody.<br>.<br>" Okay, I'll do it.<br> You'll do what? If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.<br> Oh my God! If I have to I'll, I'll do all again, I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.<br>T.<br>A.<br> meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.<br> - Really? - Yeah, if I have to.<br> Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.<br> You're the most wonderful man.<br> And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.<br>' But you're not.<br> Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.<br> I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.<br> God.<br> I love you.<br> I know you do.<br> Me too.<br> So what now? I guess we just keep dancing.<br> Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she? Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.<br> Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.<br> Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.<br> Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door.<br> It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil.<br> I think what you have to do is try not to Oh my God! OH.<br>.<br>MY.<br>.<br>GAWD!! OH.<br>.<br>MY.<br>.<br>GOD!! All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend,  and dammit I am a good friend.<br> So just, just shut up and close your eyes.<br> Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.<br> But that was a hell of a kiss.<br> Rachel is a very lucky girl.<br>   <br>
