                    			All of a sudden, so much is happening.<br> I know.<br> Ross is getting married.<br> Phoebe's making people.<br> -Everybody's doing stuff.<br> -We just sit here.<br> If I died, people would know I was here only by the ass print on this chair! -What are we doing? -Wasting our lives.<br> I meant for lunch.<br> We have to do something.<br> Something huge! We could climb Mt.<br> Everest.<br> Not something stupid.<br> Something huge! I saw an ad for this video.<br> People climb that thing every day.<br> We could totally do that! Why not? I mean, it's just climbing.<br> -It's just steep! -Yeah.<br> We're going! It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.<br> What's up? -We're gonna climb Mt.<br> Everest.<br> -Yeah, baby! I looked into that.<br> Yeah, but it costs like $60,000, and, you know, you could die.<br> And you would die.<br> We could get that Everest video.<br> We could do that without risking our lives at all.<br> While we're at the video store, we could rent Die Hard! I just remembered.<br> That Everest thing is only available through mail order.<br> So you'll stay here and hang out with me? But one of these days we'll get off our butts and rent Die Hard again! The One with the lnvitation That was fast.<br> It usually takes me hours to get Ben to go down for his nap.<br> He's such a sweetheart.<br> Do you know what he said? -Good night, mommy.<br> -That's because he has lots of mommies.<br> Yeah, in fact, it's kind of become his word for "woman".<br> So does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not? Oh, God! Nobody likes him.<br> He's so cheap.<br> He'd never fly to London in a million years.<br> Invite him! Did I do these neat enough? Yeah, they're fine.<br> We'll say that Ben addressed them.<br> You invited Rachel then? Sure, why not? Really? I wouldn't be comfortable having any of my old lovers there.<br> Do you think we shouldn't invite her? You know I absolutely adore Rachel.<br> It's just that I thought it might be awkward for you.<br> But it's absolutely your decision.<br> -More tea? -Sure.<br> Earl Grey? Fine, invite whoever you want.<br> I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again.<br> And I just want a million dollars! Oh God, Monica.<br> Thank God! This is Rachel.<br> Another Lincoln High survivor.<br> This is Chandler.<br> Phoebe.<br> Joey.<br> -Do you remember Ross? -Sure.<br> Back in high school I had a major crush on you.<br> I knew.<br> You did? I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.<br> I did.<br> Listen, do you think Try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor.<br> Would it be okay if I asked you out sometime? Maybe.<br> Okay, maybe I will.<br> See, I see big passion in your future.<br> -Really? -I do.<br> Ross, you're so great.<br> It's never gonna happen.<br> I have a question.<br> Actually, it's not so much a question.<br> It's more of a general wondering ment.<br> Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to.<br> Yes, yes.<br> That's right.<br> Look! What? Top of the world looking Down on creation And the only explanation I can find Listen, missy! If you want this cart, you'll have to take me with it! -Did you see that? -You were incredible! A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.<br> I could not have done this without you.<br> More clothes in the dryer? I'm fine.<br> You had no right to tell me you had feelings for me.<br> I was doing great with Julie before I found out.<br> I was doing great too.<br> It's not easy for me to see you with Julie.<br> I don't need this right now.<br> It's too late.<br> I'm with somebody else.<br> This ship has sailed! All right, fine! Go ahead and do that.<br> I don't need your stupid ship! This is the first time I'm doing something I care about.<br> I'm doing something that I'm actually good at.<br> If you don't get that I get that, but I'm tired of your answering machine.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Neither do l! Is this about Mark? Oh, my God! Okay, it's not.<br> I can't keep having this same fight over and over again.<br> You're making this too hard! I am? What do you want me to do? I don't know.<br> Look, maybe we should just take a break.<br> You're right.<br> Let's cool off.<br> Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.<br> A break from us.<br> -Why are we rushing? -The girlfriend I told you about.<br> She wants to get back together with me.<br> I found it! That's so great for you guys! -Good luck with your girlfriend.<br> -Thank you.<br> -You got my message? -You are right on time.<br> Can I be your girlfriend again? You can very much.<br> I want you to leave.<br> Get out! I want to talk about this.<br> All right, how was she? -What? -Was she good? Don't answer! You wanted to talk about it.<br> How was she? She was.<br> -She was not good, not good.<br> -Nothing compared to you.<br> She was different.<br> Good different? Nobody likes change.<br> Just stop! The way you owned up to everything.<br> It's just showed me how much you've grown, you know? I mean, my mom never thought this would work out.<br> She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater.<br>" I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.<br> But if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective.<br> We were on a break! You seem to really like her.<br> What do I do? We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.<br> No commitment.<br> That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends asking to hear stories about you Iooking through Monica's photo albums.<br> You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.<br> You think? You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.<br> And you're sitting here in a hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.<br> -You're right.<br> -Yeah.<br> This is so amazing! My brother's getting married and in London! It's so romantic.<br> Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper.<br> You're at the wedding.<br> You have to cry.<br> Handkerchief? No, I got my invitation.<br> Isn't this adorable? Ross let Ben address mine.<br> Did you get your invitation to Ross' wedding? No.<br> Don't worry, I get to bring a guest.<br> We'll show him.<br> I'm so jealous you're all going.<br> I never knew you can't fly in your third trimester.<br> I didn't, either.<br> I knew that.<br> So I didn't know that.<br> But you should see your faces.<br> What's up? Just hanging out.<br> What's this? Ross' wedding invitation? Maybe that's the one we should have hidden.<br> No, you guys, come on.<br> You don't have to do that.<br> I'm happy for him.<br> I am.<br> I really I'll work on it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're going to come, though, aren't you? I don't know.<br> This isn't one of those "lf she doesn't come, we don't come"? -I bought my ticket.<br> -You're not even invited.<br> You know what would be real weird? If you weren't there.<br> -Just say you'll think about it.<br> -I'll think about it.<br> -Who's this from? -That's Ross'.<br> Oh, my God! He remembered.<br> Remembered what? It was months ago.<br> We were walking by this antique store.<br> I saw this and told him it was like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.<br> I can't believe he remembered! This must've cost a fortune.<br> I can't believe he did this.<br> Remember when he fell in love with Carol and got her that expensive crystal duck? What did you just say? Oh, my God! Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.<br> Oh, my God! -We were in school together.<br> -We haven't seen each other since.<br> I land in China.<br> Guess who's in charge of the dig? Julie! Isn't that great? Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? That is so sweet! No, you hang up.<br> No, you One, two, three.<br> You didn't hang up! She didn't hang up either.<br> Okay, no.<br> No, you hang up.<br> You! Ross, hi.<br> It's Rachel.<br> I'm just calling to say that everything's fine.<br> And I'm really happy for you and your cat.<br> Obviously, I am over you.<br> I am over you.<br> And that, my friend, is what they call closure.<br> I got a message from you.<br> Oh, my God! Hang up the phone! Give me the phone! You're over me? Oh, God.<br> You're over me? When were you under me? Basically Iately, I've.<br> I've sort of had feelings for you.<br> I need to lie down.<br> He broke up with Julie! Go hug her, for God's sakes! -Really? -Really.<br> It's always been you, Rach.<br> Oh, God.<br> Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.<br> That's okay.<br> You're worth the wait.<br> And I don't just mean tonight.<br> Oh, God! Honey.<br> That's okay.<br> No, you just rolled over the juice box.<br> Did you say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place? I'm sorry.<br> Was I not supposed to? You ended it! Because I was mad at you.<br> Not because I stopped loving you.<br> You still love me? What does this mean? Do you want to get back together? Maybe.<br> I don't know.<br> I just, I feel.<br> I can't believe I even thought of getting back together.<br> We're so over! Fine by me! And hey! Just so you know, it's not that common.<br> It doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal.<br> I knew it! Rachel's coming up.<br> Doesn't she look pretty? Oh, my God! This is us getting ready for the prom.<br> We don't have to watch this.<br> Yeah, we do! Come on! -Get a shot of Monica.<br> -How do you zoom out? There she is! Shut up! The camera adds 10 pounds.<br> So how many cameras are actually on you? Dad, turn it off! It is off.<br> Right, Ross? Looking good, Mr.<br> Kotter! I can't go to my prom without a date.<br> It's too late.<br> If you're not going, then I don't want to go either.<br> I have a wonderful idea.<br> You should take Rachel to the prom.<br> We've seen enough.<br> Let's turn it off.<br> -I want to see! -Fine, I'm not going to watch.<br> Come on, kid.<br> Let's go.<br> Are you handsome! Let's show them! -Okay, Dad.<br> -Rachel, ready or not.<br> Here comes your knight in shining Oh, dear! How do I turn this off? I can't believe you did that.<br> Yeah, well.<br> See? He's her lobster! No.<br> You're really not going? It's just going to be too hard.<br> You know, I mean it's Ross.<br> How can I watch him get married? It's just for the best.<br> You know? It is.<br> Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.<br> She's going to be pretty big by then.<br> She'll need someone to help her tie her shoes.<br> Drive her to the hospital if she goes into labor.<br> You don't have a car.<br> And your license expired.<br> There's so much to do, and I have so little time! Check this out.<br> There's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums.<br> "It's almost as good as being there.<br>" It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear.<br> You could, but just the one time.<br> We could get videos of the sights get a VCR in our hotel room and never have to go outside! -lf we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard.<br> -I bet the British version is good!   <br>
