Hey .<br> She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.<br> Ms.<br> Greene wants to establish some ground rules before she comes out.<br> Please don't use the words "old" or "downhill" or "They still look pretty damn good.<br> " They do.<br> Rachel, come on out.<br> Monica made breakfast.<br> Chocolate chip pancakes.<br> We've got presents.<br> Good ones? They're all from the list you gave us two weeks ago.<br> Can I keep the presents and still be 29? Come on, Rach, turning 30 is not that big a deal.<br> Really? Is that how you felt when you turned 30? Why, God, why? We had a deal.<br> Let the others grow old, not me! You guys, is it just me? Am I overreacting? No, it's not just you.<br> My 30th birthday sure wasn't much fun.<br> And now Chandler! We're all getting so old.<br> Why are You doing this to us? The One Where They All Turn Thirty You're in a great place in your life.<br> You have an amazing job, good friends.<br> Your roommate's a soap opera star.<br> Your character is in a coma.<br> I promised myself I wouldn't cry at this one.<br> I know my life's going pretty well, but I see so many people who've accomplished their goals before they're 30.<br> Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.<br> - Come on, Phoebe! - You can do it! - Come on.<br> - There you go.<br> I did it! One mile on a Hippity Hop.<br> That's everything I wanted to do before I was 30.<br> Except I wanted to patch things up with my sister.<br> Oh, well.<br> But, yeah! Girls, this thing is a godsend, if you know what I mean.<br> Let's have some fun.<br> What do you want to do? I don't want to do anything.<br> Doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.<br> That was a practical purchase.<br> I needed that car for transportation.<br> Okay? I have a child.<br> How hot do I look in this? Ross, a sports car? Wouldn't it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there? That's not what this is about.<br> I am a sports car enthusiast.<br> - I've always been into cars.<br> - What's the horsepower? I don't know, but look how shiny! - I can't believe you bought this.<br> - So can I have a ride, stud? Hop in.<br> Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.<br> Damn it.<br> Okay, who's next? I am gonna do something today.<br> I won't sit around like some old lady.<br> I want to get something pierced.<br> Like my nose or my tongue or something.<br> Really? Because that hurts.<br> So what? The way I see it Son of a bitch! Look, I know what you're going through.<br> I'm totally freaked out about turning 25.<br> Get out of my apartment.<br> Rach, I think that you're doing great.<br> Let's face it, no one handles this well.<br> Least of all you.<br> Put that back on.<br> Monica will be here any minute.<br> But it hurts my Joey's apple.<br> For the last time, it's not named after each individual man.<br> You've done a wonderful job with the party.<br> Everything's so lovely.<br> Well, not as lovely as you.<br> I can't believe you have a And I can't believe you have a tux that's 30 years old.<br> It's older than that.<br> Ross was conceived right near this tuxedo.<br> Everybody hide! She's coming.<br> Everybody down! Everybody stay here.<br> I'll find out what's going on.<br> Hey, you got the door open! Hey, are you drunk? No.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> See, I was a little nervous about turning 30.<br> So the busboys took me out for some drinks.<br> Might want to puke on you later.<br> Here's the thing.<br> We've thrown a very formal surprise party for you.<br> - Your parents and friends are in there.<br> - No! - Yes! Yes! - No.<br> Oh, no! My parents have never seen me drunk.<br> That they know of.<br> We'll get you some coffee.<br> They'll never know that you're drunk.<br> - You promise? - I'll take care of it.<br> I love you so much.<br> Okay, we have to do something about your breath.<br> What about your breath? That's still yours.<br> Now remember, it's a surprise party.<br> So when you go in, act surprised.<br> Ready? Surprise! Okay, forward.<br> Forward.<br> Stop! Okay, back Stop! Okay, for Stop! Stop! Stop! Okay, here's what we're gonna do.<br> I'll break into this minivan, put it in neutral.<br> You push it forward so Ross can get out of the spot.<br> All right.<br> Here we go.<br> Haul ass! Happy 30th birthday! Here.<br> It's for the child in you.<br> And the woman.<br> Happy 30th! Why do you keep saying that? Because it's our 30th birthday.<br> Yeah, no, we're not 30.<br> We're 31.<br> Okay.<br> Wait.<br> Oh, it's you.<br> Yeah.<br> What? Yeah, we're not 30.<br> We're 31.<br> That's what it says on my birth certificate.<br> You have a birth certificate? I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.<br> Our mom.<br> Right.<br> Okay.<br> - Do you have mine? - No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God, we are 31! Yeah.<br> I just lost a whole year of my life.<br> Okay.<br> - Your middle name is Pamela? - Yes.<br> I never knew mine.<br> Do you remember what it is? Yes.<br> Phoebe.<br> - That's my first name.<br> - Right.<br> Okay.<br> Then, no.<br> We made it across the room.<br> You're doing great.<br> What's going on? Monica's a little drunk.<br> Yeah! I love drunk Monica.<br> Oh, she's so much more fun than regular Monica.<br> She doesn't want her parents to know.<br> All right, all right.<br> Here's what we'll do.<br> I'll get twice as drunk, then no one will even notice her.<br> What's going on? Monica's wasted.<br> Maybe that'll liven up this party.<br> Will you just help her get changed? Taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.<br> This one's from me.<br> It wasn't on your list, but it's really fun.<br> A scooter.<br> Stick to the list.<br> Always stick to the list.<br> No, no, I love it.<br> Thank you.<br> Open ours next! Open ours next! Now that you're a couple, we don't get two gifts? For my last birthday, you gave me a hug.<br> Read the card! Read the card! "Happy birthday, Grandma.<br> It's better to be over the hill than buried under it.<br> All our love, Monica and Chandler.<br> " That's funny.<br> No, no.<br> That was a joke.<br> I know, I get it.<br> It's funny.<br> Because you're not a grandma.<br> To be a grandma, you have to be married and have children.<br> I don't have any of those things.<br> That's why it's so funny.<br> I'm just gonna go .<br> All you had to do was buy the card.<br> It was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.<br> All I really needed was a plan.<br> See, I want three kids.<br> And you want to have them all at the same time and all for your brother.<br> As I was saying .<br> I should have the first one by the time I'm 35.<br> Which gives me five years.<br> If I want a kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.<br> Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes.<br> But I want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.<br> Really? That long? Look all you want, it's happening.<br> I don't have to get married until I'm 33.<br> That's three whole years.<br> Wait a minute, though.<br> I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding.<br> And I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged.<br> Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm 30.<br> Which is fine because you just turned 28! No, Ross.<br> No, it is not fine.<br> I should already be with the guy I'm gonna marry.<br> Will you quit hogging it? I'm telling you, it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.<br> You're drunk.<br> Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.<br> Maybe I'm a little drunk.<br> Are those crab cakes? I told you to come straight to me when they were ready.<br> How you feeling? You are so handsome.<br> I want to make love to you right here, right now.<br> I really wish that you wouldn't.<br> Just get through a little bit more, then we can put you in bed.<br> Just smile, and don't talk to anyone.<br> Speech, speech! Let's hear from the birthday girl.<br> Pheebs! See, everybody's looking at me.<br> The plan's working.<br> I didn't even have to take off my top yet.<br> Speech.<br> Come on, speech! You can't keep your hands off her for one second.<br> I think it's nice.<br> I think it's necessary.<br> I want to thank you all for coming.<br> My family and my friends.<br> I'd really like to say that I'm .<br> You know what I'd really like to say? I'm drunk! That's right, Mom and Dad.<br> Your little old "Harmomica" is hammered.<br> And guess what? I've been drunk before.<br> And I've smoked a cigarette.<br> It's all okay.<br> It's okay because I turned 30 today.<br> And I can do anything I want.<br> Because I am a grownup.<br> Okay, quick.<br> Help me get this off.<br> I lost a whole year.<br> I can't believe it.<br> This is so unfair! Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.<br> Will it? Will it? How would you feel if you found out you were 31? That's not gonna happen.<br> Because we have a new deal.<br> Plus, it ruined my schedule.<br> I haven't done the things I wanted to do before I was 31.<br> Like what? Like I haven't met any Portuguese people.<br> I haven't had the perfect kiss.<br> And I haven't been to sniper school.<br> Why don't we go and have some birthday cake? I just feel like being by myself.<br> See you guys later.<br> Thanks.<br> Poor Pheebs.<br> Hey, you guys, I think I'm gonna walk her home.<br> - Oh, man.<br> - What? He's gonna eat the cake.<br> Pheebs! Listen, I .<br> Close your eyes.<br> That's one thing to cross off your list.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.<br> Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up and move it.<br> All we need is teamwork.<br> We're gonna lift the car and slide it out.<br> Lift and slide.<br> - Ross, I really don't think this - Lift and slide.<br> - Okay, here we go.<br> - All right, everyone.<br> Lift and slide.<br> - Hey, Joey - Come on, Rach, my turn just started.<br> Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.<br> Oh, okay.<br> Hey, can I ride this outside? Whatever.<br> I'm not your mother.<br> Not in the street! - Are you feeling any better? - Yeah, I'm doing okay.<br> I'm .<br> Let's talk.<br> What's up? Oh, Tag .<br> You're such a great guy.<br> And we have so much fun together.<br> - But l - Wait.<br> I think I see where you're going.<br> Before you say anything else, can I say one more thing? Well said.<br> And a good example of the fun I was referring to.<br> But I think I'm past the point where I can just have fun.<br> Don't do this.<br> This is just because you're turning 30.<br> Yeah, it is.<br> But you're just a kid.<br> I mean, you're 25.<br> - Twenty-four, actually.<br> - Oh, God.<br> You know what I wish? I wish you were six years older.<br> Well, if I'm wishing for stuff, I wish I was six years younger.<br> - Me too.<br> - Yeah.<br> Sorry.<br> Hey, how'd it go? If I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year? You did the right thing.<br> I don't like this anymore.<br> Well, here we are.<br> Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.<br> Do you realize in 10 years we're gonna be 40? Why, God? Why are you doing this to us? Yes! My baby's finally free.<br> All right! Start it up.<br> Let's go! How hot are we? You want to buy a car?   <br>
