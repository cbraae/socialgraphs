You don 't feel that now.<br> It was crazy.<br> You're fine.<br> You're better than fine.<br> "You are", "as your friend Tony" "would say", "Great!" Everything's normal.<br> "She's just your friend", "Rachel.<br>" "Your friend", "Rachel.<br>" Your friend.<br> Rachel.<br> - Hi, sweetie.<br> "- Hey", "it's your girlfriend", "Rachel!" The One Where Chandler Takes A Bath mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Are you? Are you high? I had the most amazing bath.<br> - Really? I don't like baths.<br> - You like them with me.<br> Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.<br> It's the wet, naked lady.<br> - Baths are so relaxing.<br> - Really? What do you do? You just sit in there, stewing in your own filth.<br> How dirty do you think I am? If you had some candles and bubbles and music, you'd love it.<br> It'd take all your stress away.<br> It's 2:00 on Wednesday, I'm watching "Road Rules.<br>" How stressed am I? Hey, Chandler.<br> I really need to talk to you.<br> Is this a cold pizza or a leftover-meat loaf talk? - Well, neither.<br> - Oh, my God, what's up? I don't know.<br> It's just Lately, I've been feeling Okay, here's what it is.<br> - I feel a lot better.<br> Thanks.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> Just come back.<br> You and Monica, friends for a long time.<br> And sure, there are rules.<br> But then you went to London.<br> But that's different.<br> There are rules there too, know what I mean? Do you? It was different for you guys.<br> You were both in the same place.<br> Yes, when Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.<br> This is a bad idea.<br> Forget all about it.<br> This conversation between you and me.<br> If that.<br> Ross, don't forget that doctor's appointment.<br> - Right.<br> - To find out the sex of the baby? We don't wanna know as long as it's happy and healthy.<br> Yep, healthy.<br> And cute.<br> - Smart.<br> With an aptitude for science.<br> - Popular.<br> Are you two talking about the same baby? - Have you thought of names? - I've come up with a bunch.<br> - Really? Me too.<br> - Me too.<br> Really? If it's a girl, Phoebe.<br> And if it's a boy, Pheebo.<br> Maybe.<br> But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Rach, what were you thinking? I was thinking if it's a girl how about Sandrene? It's French.<br> That's a really pretty name for an industrial solvent.<br> - Fine.<br> What do you have? - It's for a boy.<br> I know it's a little out there, but Darwin.<br> Our child will be beaten in the schoolyard.<br> Yeah, by Sandrene.<br> You're saying that because I said no to you.<br> I'm really, really not.<br> How about you each get five vetoes? - That sounds fair.<br> - I don't think you'll need it.<br> If it's a girl, Rain.<br> - Veto.<br> - Why? Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.<br> I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.<br>" I know her! I bought a homemade soap from her at a Dead show! - Okay.<br> How about for a guy, Thatcher? - Why do you hate our child? - Fine, you go.<br> - Okay.<br> James.<br> - But only if it's a girl.<br> - Veto.<br> I like Ruth.<br> What about Ruth? Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Are we having an 89-year-old? - How about Dayton? - Veto.<br> Stewart.<br> Veto.<br> Sawyer.<br> - Veto.<br> Helen.<br> - Veto.<br> Is it me, or is Veto starting to sound really good? Boy, do I have a surprise for you.<br> Sex on the balcony? No.<br> But someone's not gonna get over that idea.<br> - What? - I drew you a bath.<br> I don't like baths.<br> Could you draw me a picture of sex on the balcony? Try it for me.<br> I used all my best stuff.<br> I lit candles, I put on music.<br> I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.<br> And got you this little plastic Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.<br> - This does butch it up a bit.<br> - I swear, you will love it.<br> If I do this, can we discuss balcony sex? Absolutely.<br> But I know how that discussion's gonna go.<br> "All right", "this isn 't so bad.<br>" I like the flowery smell.<br> "Which is okay", because I've got my boat.<br> - So? - Oh, my God.<br> I told you you were a bath person.<br> Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.<br> I'm gonna need a bigger boat.<br> I don't think you had an open mind about Ruth.<br> Little Ruthie Geller? How cute is that? Oh, my God, I can practically hear the mahjong tiles.<br> All your tests look fine.<br> Are you interested in the sex of the baby? - No, we're not.<br> - You have it right there? You know if it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo? But if you don't wanna know - No, we wanna wait.<br> Right? - Right.<br> Right.<br> Oh, I'll be right back.<br> I know it's really not my place but please don't name your child Pheebo.<br> So, which of these babies is the ugliest? What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.<br> They're babies.<br> They're all beautiful.<br> - Third one from the left? - Yeah.<br> Why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it.<br> Don't you? You're looking! - I didn't! - I saw you! Fine, I did, but I didn't see anything.<br> Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you! - But I didn't - Don't tell me! I don't wanna know! I couldn't, because I don't know! I swear I didn't see anything! It was just a momentary lapse.<br> Don't you have any self-control? Okay.<br> A couple months late on the lecture, Ross.<br> Hello? Can you come in here? There's something wrong.<br> You know what? I think I'll wait out here.<br> I'm in the bathtub.<br> - What's wrong? - I drew a bath, but I did it wrong.<br> The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve and is now lodged places.<br> And the scents I used don't compliment each other.<br> Eucalyptus and chamomile? - What? - Bath salts.<br> They're starting to effervesce.<br> It's different.<br> It's interesting.<br> Let's talk about something else.<br> Yeah.<br> Sure.<br> So, what was going on with you today? I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey.<br> He was talking about rules and right and wrong.<br> - I had the same conversation.<br> - What was he talking about? He hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since he was in "Macbeth.<br>" - That was a long night.<br> - What exactly did he say to you? He was talking about rules and looking at people differently.<br> - Not to me.<br> - What'd he tell you? He asked about you, me and London.<br> And the glue that holds this all together, the rules.<br> Okay.<br> So you, me and London.<br> Looking at people differently.<br> Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London.<br> But what'd he mean by "rules"? Wait.<br> He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in.<br> - He's looking at her differently.<br> - Phoebe is his friend.<br> That'd be breaking the rules.<br> My God, he wants to do it with Phoebe in London! - You guys? - Just a minute! - That's Mrs.<br> Tribbiani.<br> - You don't say anything.<br> Why would I? That two of our friends could start a great love affair? They'd have me to thank.<br> Then we could all start having babies! - I won't let you say anything.<br> - Stay here.<br> Oh, God! I brought back your iron.<br> I thought I lost it.<br> I got a new one a month ago.<br> Oh, just as well.<br> I broke this one.<br> - What? - Nothing.<br> I really shouldn't say.<br> I'm really not supposed to.<br> Fine.<br> - It's a humdinger.<br> - Too bad you can't tell me.<br> Somebody likes you! - Is it Chandler? - No! - Then tell him to stop staring.<br> - It's Joey.<br> Really? Joey? You don't say.<br> - Would you be interested? - I don't know, I don't know.<br> You know, I mean, on the one hand, "Mother, may I?" But, you know, on the other hand No.<br> No, I can't.<br> We're friends.<br> Oh, no.<br> I don't wanna risk what we have.<br> I guess that makes sense.<br> You think you're gonna talk to him? Sure.<br> I mean, it's Joey.<br> I don't want him to get hurt.<br> Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey.<br> - Not Chandler.<br> Just Joey.<br> - Sure.<br> You know what? I'm coming around on the name Ruth.<br> I'd consider naming our child that.<br> Rach, I can't tell you how much that means to me.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You hated the name Ruth.<br> Why would you change your mind? Unless you know we're never gonna have to use it.<br> You did see.<br> You know it's a boy! I didn't see anything.<br> I changed my mind.<br> I don't think so.<br> You're giving me Ruth so you get to name him when it's a boy.<br> That's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.<br> I would Sequoia! - Veto.<br> - Fine.<br> Unless you anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl.<br> And you really do want her to be named Ruth.<br> Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table! - But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.<br> - Not like this! Hey.<br> What's up? - Joey, I know.<br> - What? - I know.<br> - What? - I know about your feelings.<br> - Oh, my God, you do? I'm sorry.<br> Things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.<br> I know.<br> And this is so much more complicated than it was for them.<br> I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.<br> For God's sakes, it's Rachel! I know! She's not only my friend, she's my pregnant friend.<br> She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex! Yeah, that's Rachel.<br> Beat me over the head with it.<br> What am I gonna do? I keep trying to get rid of these feelings.<br> I made a list of everything I don't like about her.<br> - You wanna hear it? - Yeah.<br> "She made me switch to light mayo.<br>" That's it! That's all I got! You know what? Tastes the same and my pants fit better.<br> - Joey, this is probably just a crush.<br> - You think? Absolutely.<br> You get this rush of feelings, but it goes away.<br> Yeah, just a crush.<br> That's all this is.<br> It's a crush! I'm Joey.<br> I don't get deep feelings.<br> There you go.<br> Crushes happen all the time.<br> I've had them for all you guys.<br> Except for Ross and Chandler.<br> - And I'm sure you've had them for us.<br> - Not really.<br> Throw me a bone here.<br> So I called the doctor.<br> - Now we both know the sex of the baby.<br> - What? That's right.<br> The student has become the master.<br> - Ross, I swear.<br> I don't know.<br> - Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.<br> - A what? - You really didn't know? - We're having a girl? - No.<br> - That's what you said.<br> - No.<br> - You said girl.<br> - Yes.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you, but still, we're having a girl! I know! You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table.<br> Yes, we'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth.<br> - Permission to veto.<br> - Yes, please.<br> Do I smell essential oils? I'm gonna take a bath.<br> I was gonna get a magazine.<br> What do you think you're doing? Leaving my troubles behind? You're new at this, but this is unacceptable bath decorum.<br> It's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.<br> You can have the bath, but I am taking your boat.<br> Now you're just a girl in a tub.<br> Hi, bubbles.<br> Manly.<br> I thought I'd let you know how it went.<br> - You told her? - She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How did it go? You were wrong.<br> He doesn't like me.<br> How would you like it if I told you that Lee Majors liked you and you found out that he didn't like you? - I don't think I'd care.<br> - Really? Lee Majors is hot.<br> - Hello? - We're in the bathroom! - Why? - Because it's a relaxing time! - What are you guys doing in here? - Oh, my God.<br> A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong.<br> - It's Rachel! - You like Rachel? It's no big deal.<br> Phoebe and I talked.<br> It's a crush.<br> It'll go away.<br> Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles.<br> Mazel tov.<br> Ross and I were looking for you.<br> What are we all doing in here? Oh, my.<br> Honey, cover it up with the boat.<br> Hello? We're all in here, and we'd love for you to join us! Well, hey! What's going on? Oh, cool boat.<br> Oh, no.<br> - Did you tell them? - I waited for you.<br> - Tell us what? - We're having a girl.<br> Oh, wow! Really? I'll get you later.<br> All right.<br> It's a new day.<br> And it's just a crush.<br> That's all.<br> Just a little crush.<br> All that worrying I was doing? That was crazy.<br> Like my friend the bird here "would say", "It was cuckoo!" Everything's gonna be fine.<br> It's just a crush.<br> - Hi, sweetie.<br> - I love you.<br> It's nice to do this together, isn't it? Yeah.<br> And what you're doing feels so good.<br> - I'm not touching you.<br> - You're not? - It's the salts.<br> - Sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.<br> Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy.<br>   <br>
