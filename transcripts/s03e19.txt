Dr.<br> Drake Ramoray? Days of our Lives? voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat? No, that's not it.<br> So you're a soap actor.<br> This must be exciting for you, being in a real play.<br> Hey, I've done plays before.<br> I'm a serious actor.<br> That infomercial! For the milk-carton-spout thing! You're the guy who doesn't know how to pour milk! I actually can pour milk.<br> But I got you believing that I couldn't.<br> Now, see, that's acting.<br> Right.<br> At the end, you choked on a cookie.<br> That was real.<br> -I cannot believe Mark asked you out.<br> -I know.<br> What are you gonna tell him? I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.<br> I think I'd say no to anybody right now.<br> But it was so strange.<br> I mean, I'm standing there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>with this charming, cute guy who's asking me to go out with him.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>which I'm allowed to do.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I felt guilty, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.<br> Wow.<br> So, okay, maybe that means.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.<br> -I don't have issues with my father.<br> -So it's just the Ross thing.<br> I hate this woman! I hate her! She told everyone about that infomercial.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks! And whenever I can't do it, they're all, like, laughing at me! So Rachel called.<br> Wants to see me.<br> Going over in a minute.<br> -What do you think she wants? -Maybe the crazy fog has lifted.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and she realizes that life without me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>sucks.<br> It's possible.<br> You are very lovable.<br> I'd miss you if I broke up with you.<br> Just trying to be supportive.<br> Be supportive like a guy.<br> If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.<br> You wanted to see me? Here's a box of your stuff.<br> It's just hats and a shirt and CDS.<br> Just stuff that you've left here.<br> What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me or something? It just seems that, you know, it's time we move on.<br> I mean, don't you think? -Yes, I do.<br> -Good.<br> I really do.<br> This was a gift.<br> You got that for free from the museum gift shop.<br> It's still a gift.<br> I got it from the "gift" shop.<br> Okay! All right! Give me the mug! I'll keep the mug! Don't do me any favors.<br> In fact.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>where's the rest of my stuff? Like my.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> This book is mine! And that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too.<br> Yes, I do.<br> You know how much I love that T-shirt.<br> You never even wear that T-shirt.<br> I'm just trying to help you "move on.<br> " Oh, you are a petty man.<br> You are a petty, petty.<br> .<br> .<br> -Petty.<br> .<br> .<br> -.<br> .<br> .<br> petty, petty.<br> .<br> .<br> -.<br> .<br> .<br>small.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -.<br> .<br> .<br>small.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You are so just doing this out of spite.<br> I'm gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt! You haven't worn it since you were 1 5! It doesn't even fit you anymore! If you don't mind, I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and "relax" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in my favorite shirt.<br> You have a pleasant evening.<br> So you're, like, a zillionaire.<br> And you're our age.<br> You're our age.<br> You know what? You should buy a state.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then just name it after yourself.<br> Like, "Pete Dakota"? Or "Mississi-Pete.<br> " I got it: "Pete Chicago.<br> " That's not a state, Joe.<br> Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is? I gotta go.<br> I'll see you guys later.<br> You're our age.<br> So are we on for tomorrow? Absolutely.<br> Now, get out of here, you! Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him.<br> Is something wrong with me? Why am I only attracted to guys with no future? Either they're too old, or they're too young.<br> And there's Pete, who's crazy about me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and he's absolutely perfect, and there's zip going on! Does it sound like something's wrong with me? Yeah, kind of.<br> Happy? ls that what I'm supposed to be, vic? Happy? Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out! I talk to you, and nothing! You look at me, and it's nothing! Nothing.<br> Tasty.<br> I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history.<br> It's nice.<br> I have a question about this scene.<br> I don't understand why Adrianne's attracted to victor.<br> Peel the onion.<br> First of all, he's good-looking.<br> My character needs a bit more of a reason than that.<br> Hey, how about this one? It says so in the script! I don't know why my character likes you either.<br> I mean, it says in the script that you're a bitch.<br> -It doesn't say that in the script.<br> -It does in mine.<br> I can blow-dry it, gel it.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> I still wind up with this little.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>cowlick-y thing on the middle part of my head.<br> It's so annoying.<br> -Does it bug you? -You bug me.<br> Is there any chance you didn't see that? Ross, you gotta stop, okay? You can't stare through the peephole for three hours.<br> You're gonna get peep-eye.<br> I knew it.<br> I knew it.<br> I always knew she liked him.<br> She'd say no, but here we are.<br> We just broke up, first thing she does! You didn't "just break up.<br> " It's been, like, three weeks! You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.<br> I mean, bullets have left guns slower.<br> Here they come! Here they-- If she kisses him good night, I'll kill myself.<br> I can't watch.<br> Come on.<br> Date over! Date over! Here we go.<br> She's going in.<br> She's going in.<br> Wait! He's going in! He's going in! The door's closed! I can't see anything with the door closed! And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.<br> I have to do something.<br> I have to stop it! -Stop what? -I don't know.<br> But I have a feeling my being there will do it.<br> I'll go over and I will borrow something! Juice! I need juice! You can't! -They must be stopped! -I am your friend.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I won't let you do this! You are surprisingly strong! -I need juice! People need juice! -Look, man.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -People need juice! -Listen to me! She's moving on.<br> If it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.<br> And unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you'll have to get used to the fact that it's over! Okay, man? It's over.<br> It's just I miss her so much.<br> I know.<br> Why do your coffee mugs have numbers? Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.<br> So if one of them's missing, she can be like, "Where's number 27?" You know what? No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.<br> -I can't do this.<br> -That's what I didn't want to know.<br> Oh, I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know? I'm doing it to get back at Ross.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's not very fair to you.<br> Fair, shmair.<br> You know? You wanna get back at Ross, I am here for you.<br> Really.<br> I say we get back at him right here on this couch.<br> Right here! Oh, my God.<br> I'm sorry about this.<br> That's okay.<br> You sure? I can just go home and get back at him by myself.<br> --and should become the penicillin of the 2 1st century.<br> And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>toward leading that revolution.<br> Can I ask you something? Where are we? Well, with all these doctors and nurses.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm gonna say, "Midget Rodeo.<br> " Just tell me the truth.<br> You know, I don't think I told you this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I just recently got out of a serious relationship.<br> Oh, right.<br> Wasn't that a year ago? So I did tell you.<br> That's not really the thing.<br> I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me.<br> -Do you know what I mean? -Oh, I know.<br> -I so want to be attracted to you.<br> -But you're not.<br> Okay.<br> Good.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You know what? Don't be.<br> Don't be, because it's not so bad.<br> It's not? Yeah.<br> I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.<br> Or someone you find attractive.<br> I just think, you know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that you might end up feeling differently.<br> I don't want this to come out wrong.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but you're awfully confident for a guy I said I wasn't attracted to.<br> Stupidly charming, isn't it? You wanna get something to eat? This place is kind of depressing.<br> Now the man who made all of this possible, Mr.<br> Peter Becker.<br> One second.<br> I don't think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in.<br> Draw! I wasn't doing anything.<br> What did she do now? Just because she went to Yale, she thinks she's the greatest actress.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>since sliced bread.<br> Ah, Sliced Bread.<br> A wonderful Lady Macbeth.<br> I hate her.<br> I hate her with her "Oh, I'm so talented" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and "Oh, I'm so pretty," and "Oh, I smell so good.<br> " I think somebody has a crush on somebody.<br> Can we please try and stay focused on my problem here? I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.<br> You're out of your mind! You've done nothing but talk about her for 48 hours.<br> If you were in school, you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now.<br> Then how come I keep thinking about her.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in all these sexual scenarios and stuff? Happy? ls that what I'm supposed to be, vic? Happy? Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be, huh? Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.<br> I talk to you, and it's nothing.<br> You look at me, and nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.<br> -Well, that was.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -Better? Yeah, it was definitely.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>an improvement.<br> -Good night.<br> -Kate.<br> You forgot your shoes.<br> I'm probably gonna need those, huh? Hey, listen.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you feel like getting a cup of coffee? Kate.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you ready to go? very nice.<br> very nice.<br> -See you tomorrow? -Yeah.<br> Sure.<br> -Right.<br> -Good night.<br> Why isn't it "Spiderman"? Like Goldman, Silverman? Because it's not his last name.<br> It isn't? It's not, like.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Phil Spiderman.<br> He's a Spider-.<br> .<br> .<br> : : :man: You know, like, Goldman is a last name.<br> But there's no Gold Man.<br> There should be a Gold Man! -How was work? -Oh, great.<br> Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.<br> By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.<br> Oh.<br> Well, I guess I had that one coming.<br> I'm just gonna throw it out.<br> It's probably just shampoo and-- Something wrong? No.<br> Nothing.<br> So what kind of powers would "Gold Man" have? Okay.<br> Well, he would turn things to gold.<br> -And things that are already gold? -His work is done.<br> Let's play my game.<br> All right, you yellow-bellied, lily-livered-- Draw! Yeah, it's fun.<br>   <br>
