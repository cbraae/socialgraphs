                    			Any entertainment there? All right.<br> Here we go! We're very happy for you.<br> What's the matter? We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else will, so.<br> All right, I'll take care of it.<br> It's 30 seconds to midnight, what are you gonna do? Will you just trust me? Thirty-three, 32, 31 Who are you kissing at midnight? Rachel or Phoebe? You can't kiss your sister.<br> -Who's gonna kiss my sister? -Chandler.<br> Oh, man! Really? Would you rather have me or him kiss her? That's a good point.<br> Since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.<br> Phoebe! Listen.<br> Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.<br> So obvious.<br> Why doesn't he just ask? -Rach! I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.<br> -What? You can't kiss Ross.<br> You got the history.<br> So? -Would you prefer me or Chandler? -Good point.<br> Three, two, one! Happy New Year! -Happy New Year.<br> -Happy New Year.<br> -Happy New Year.<br> -You too.<br> Happy New Year, Joey.<br> So that do anything for you? The One with All the Resolutions You know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say "No divorces in '99!" But your divorce isn't final yet.<br> Just the one divorce in '99! I am gonna be happy this year.<br> I am gonna make myself happy.<br> Do you want us to leave the room? Every day I am gonna do one thing I have never done before.<br> That is my New Year's resolution.<br> That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.<br> Now you only have to find a planeload of people whose resolution is to plummet to their deaths.<br> Maybe your resolution should be not to make fun of your friends.<br> Especially the ones who might fly you to Europe for free.<br> She has a better chance of flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.<br> I'll bet $50 you can't go the year without making fun of us.<br> Better yet, a week.<br> I'll take that bet, my friend.<br> Paying me the $50 can be the "new thing you do" that day.<br> And it starts right now! My New Year's resolution is to learn how to play guitar.<br> Really? How come? You know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it if one of those was true.<br> Want me to teach you? I'm great.<br> Really? Who have you taught? Well, I taught me.<br> And I loved me.<br> That'd be great! Yeah, thanks, Phoebe.<br> My resolution is to be less obsessed with being neat and clean.<br> Really? Or something else.<br> Look.<br> Blaire forgot her glasses.<br> She'll need these to keep an eye on that boyfriend.<br> Who, from what I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I mean! Maybe your resolution should be to gossip less.<br> What? I don't gossip.<br> Maybe sometimes I find out things.<br> Or I hear something and I pass that information on.<br> You know, kind of like a public service.<br> It doesn't mean I'm a gossip.<br> Is Ted Koppel a gossip? If Ted Koppel talked about his coworkers' botched boob jobs, I would.<br> They were like this! Fine, my New Year's resolution will be not to gossip.<br> -It's easy.<br> -Easy? You have never kept a resolution.<br> -Yes, I have.<br> -Okay, let's see how you did last year.<br> No.<br> No.<br> Not my diary.<br> You cannot read my diary.<br> "Dear diary: I'm so excited.<br> My resolution is to write in you every day.<br> See you tomorrow.<br>" Nothing.<br> You know, not a lot happened last year.<br> All right, I will prove to you that I can keep it this time.<br> No more gossiping.<br> I hate gossip.<br> In junior high this girl said a lot of mean stuff about me and I set her bike on fire.<br> -Wow, what did she say about you? -She said I was crazy.<br> But I guess she got hers.<br> -I'll see you tomorrow.<br> -Okay.<br> I just asked that girl out.<br> Nice! Is that part of your "new thing" for today? Yes, it is.<br> See? "Elizabeth Hornswoggle"? That's right.<br> Elizabeth Hornswoggle.<br> You okay, Chandler? Something funny about that name? No, I just think I've heard it somewhere before.<br> Oh, really? Where? Somewhere funny, I'll bet.<br> Guess what.<br> I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.<br> Oh, this must be killing you! All right, see you later.<br> Not really.<br> -I haven't told you her middle name yet.<br> -Well, don't.<br> Just don't.<br> -See you later.<br> -See you.<br> All right, Phoebe, I am ready for my first lesson.<br> No, you don't touch the guitar.<br> First you learn here, then here.<br> Lesson one: Chords.<br> Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords.<br> But I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.<br> So then this is "Bear Claw.<br>" "Turkey Leg" and "Old Lady.<br>" What an interesting approach to guitar instruction.<br> You know, some might find it amusing.<br> I myself find it regular.<br> Hey, everybody! Rachel was so good today.<br> She didn't gossip at all.<br> I didn't.<br> Even when I found out Let's say I found out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.<br> Check this out.<br> You nailed the Old Lady! I thought I was getting better, so I stopped by this guitar store Did you touch any of the guitars there? Did you? No.<br> Give me your hands.<br> Strings.<br> Pick.<br> -Do you want to learn to play guitar? -Yes.<br> Then don't touch one! -Hi, Ben.<br> -Auntie Monica! Ross is wearing leather pants! Does nobody else see Ross is wearing leather pants? Someone comment on the pants! -I think they're very nice.<br> -I really like them a lot.<br> Not what I had in mind.<br> People like Ross don't wear these types of pants.<br> You see, they're very tight.<br> Maybe there's something in that area? I think they look really good.<br> Where'd you get them? I needed a new thing for today.<br> There's this leather store that always smells so good.<br> And I thought to myself: "Wow.<br> I've never owned a really good-smelling pair of pants before.<br>" Oh, come on! What do you think? You look like a freak.<br> Awful! What are you doing? -It's my New Year's resolution.<br> -To blind my child? To take pictures of us together.<br> It's the best resolution.<br> Everyone can enjoy them.<br> Everyone will enjoy my music as well.<br> My God, these pants! I'm burning up.<br> Oh God! She wants to snuggle now? Is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here! -Are you hot? -No.<br> It must just be me, then.<br> That was just the pants and the couch.<br> Do you mind if I use your bathroom? -Go ahead.<br> -Thanks.<br> My favorite part's coming up! Oh, my God! Tiger.<br> Dragon.<br> Iceberg! Joseph, did you even study at all last night? Yes, I did! Then do lceberg.<br> G-sharp.<br> G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords? Have you? Oh, my God! What? I didn't touch a guitar! But you're questioning my method! No, I'm not questioning it.<br> I'm saying it's stupid! What? Thank you.<br> You know, none of my other student thought I was stupid.<br> Your other student was you! Well, maybe you just need to try a little harder! Maybe I need to try a real teacher! Here! Andy Cooper.<br> He teaches guitar.<br> There's a picture of him with a kid.<br> And the kid's got a guitar! Fine! You learn from your "qualified instructor.<br>" But don't come crying when everyone is sick of hearing you play "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"! Oh, fine.<br> Take his side! I can't wait to be with you.<br> I'll sneak over as soon as I can.<br> I'll tell Rachel I'll be doing laundry.<br> Laundry.<br> Is that my new nickname? You know what your nickname is, Mr.<br> Big Would you stop looking at me like that? Phoebe was a terrible teacher.<br> I wasn't learning anything from her Look I feel bad, too Forget it, we're going around in circles.<br> Joey, it's Ross.<br> I need some help.<br> Chandler's not here.<br> You can help me.<br> I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.<br> Nice! No, I got really hot in my pants, so I took them off.<br> But they must have shrunk from the sweat.<br> Or my legs expanded from the heat.<br> I can't get them back on, Joey.<br> I can't! That is quite a situation.<br> Do you see any powder? Powder! Yeah, I have powder.<br> Good, good.<br> Sprinkle some on.<br> It'll absorb moisture.<br> Then you can get your pants on.<br> Yeah, hold on.<br> They're not coming on, man.<br> Okay, cut slits in the pants, right? Then put them back on go out there and tell her you're the lncredible Hulk.<br> Chandler's not there? That would have worked, but all right, fine.<br> You see any.<br> Oh, Vaseline? I see lotion.<br> I have lotion.<br> Will that work? Sure, throw some of that on there.<br> Hold on.<br> Sounds like it's working.<br> They're still not coming on, man.<br> And the lotion and the powder have made a paste.<br> Really.<br> What color is it? What difference does that make? If the paste matches the pants, you can make paste pants and she won't know! Do you have a minute? Dude, what am l Rachel's here, so good luck.<br> Let me know how it goes.<br> Joey, I have such a problem.<br> Your timing couldn't be better.<br> I'm putting out fires all over the place.<br> I have got to tell you something.<br> What is it? It's so huge! But promise me.<br> You cannot tell anyone.<br> No, no, no! I don't want to know.<br> You do want to know.<br> This is unbelievable! I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets and can't tell anyone.<br> You know secrets? You're not supposed to gossip! I can't keep this in.<br> So I pick up the phone I'm not listening to you! You've been in there for a long time.<br> I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.<br> All right, I'm coming out.<br> Hey, can you turn the lights off? Let's just leave the lights on.<br> Oh, my God! I had a problem.<br> I can't talk to you.<br> I don't have a fancy ad in the yellow pages.<br> I want to apologize for saying your method was stupid.<br> And maybe ask you to be my teacher again? I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.<br> You really think I'm ready? Wow, cool! -Was the chord at least right before -No.<br> Oh, my God! We heard about your pants.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> This year was supposed to be great.<br> It's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit! You're not a loser.<br> Look at me! Hey, look! Ben drew a picture of you.<br> You're a cowboy.<br> Because of the leather pants? He thinks you're a cowboy, not a loser.<br> That's something.<br> -lt really is something.<br> -Howdy, partner.<br> Maybe I should get another pair.<br> You know, they had some with fringe all down the sides.<br> Phoebe, you may know this.<br> You know strange things.<br> What is the boiling point of brain? I used to know this.<br> I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.<br> I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.<br> I would make a good cowboy.<br> Now that everything's wrapped up, I'll do my laundry.<br> Yeah, me too.<br> If this shirt is dirty.<br> I'm going to the airport.<br> If I hang around there long enough someone's bound to leave a plane unattended.<br> -Good luck, honey.<br> -Bye.<br> Remember that thing I was gonna tell you about? I won't tell you.<br> But if you found out on your own that would be okay and we could talk about it.<br> Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.<br> So that would be okay.<br> Would you mind going into Chandler's bedroom and getting that book he borrowed from me? Now? You want me to go over there now? -Do you know something? -Do you? -I might know something.<br> -I might too.<br> -What do you know? -You tell me first.<br> -I can't.<br> -Then I can't.<br> Okay, fine.<br> You don't know.<br> I'll walk into his bedroom and see the thing I think I know is actually the thing I think I know! -You know! -And you know! Yeah, I know! Chandler and Monica? Oh, this is unbelievable! -How long have you known? -Too long! I've been dying to talk to someone about this! You can't say anything to anybody.<br> They're so weird about that.<br> It's raining.<br> I don't like to fly in the rain.<br> I am gonna go for a walk in the rain.<br> Me too.<br> That's weird.<br> I bet they're doing it.<br> Okay, look.<br> I can't take it anymore.<br> So you win.<br> Okay?
