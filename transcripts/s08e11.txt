                    			Phoebe.<br> Look at that guy by the window.<br> Wow! He's awfully short.<br> And I think he's talking to himself.<br> And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.<br> What is wrong with me lately? It's like, every guy I see.<br> That guy, for example.<br> That's not someone I would be attracted to.<br> But right now, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.<br> Wait! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy.<br> This is normal.<br> Your hormones start going crazy.<br> - Really? This has happened to you? - Absolutely! And I was carrying triplets.<br> So in medical terms, I was thrice as randy.<br> This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store, sitting on Santas' laps.<br> Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield.<br> I'm seeing my doctor tomorrow.<br> Maybe she can give me a pill or something.<br> Yeah, that's what you need.<br> A good pill.<br> The One With Ross' Step Forward mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 - I got our pictures developed.<br> - Great.<br> Want to see pictures of us skating? Ordinarily, I would love to, but I am just swamped right now.<br> Where are the ones that pretzel vendor took of us? Oh, yeah.<br> Probably at the end.<br> Oh, my God! All he took were pictures of my breasts.<br> I'm missing picture time! You know, she has a face, Ross.<br> - Okay, here's a good one of us.<br> - That is a good one! It looks like a holiday card.<br> With the tree and the skaters and the snow.<br> I want to send out cards, but I never do.<br> Do you want to send this one out together? Together? Like, to people? Yeah.<br> "Happy Holidays, from Mona and Ross.<br> " lt'll be cute, okay? Okay.<br> I gotta go to work.<br> Call me later? - Bye, guys.<br> - Bye.<br> Congratulations! You just got married! Can you believe that? What's the big deal about a holiday card? Married couples and families send out cards.<br> People who just started dating don't send out cards.<br> Is she crazy? That's your wife you're talking about! Bing! And the Bingette! - You remember my boss, Doug.<br> - Yes.<br> Hi.<br> Good news! The divorce is final.<br> I signed the papers this a.<br>m.<br> You and Kara divorced? I'm sorry.<br> Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap.<br> - Congratulations to you guys.<br> - No leg-chewing for us.<br> Well, give it time.<br> The divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate.<br> We should all go out to dinner tomorrow.<br> I can't think of anything we're doing.<br> Why can't I think of anything? Tomorrow.<br> I'll be out of court by 6.<br> They keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me, and I knock them out! Okay, see you tomorrow.<br> We're not seeing him tomorrow.<br> I can't spend another evening with that man.<br> Remember how he behaved at our wedding? Because he wasn't invited.<br> He misbehaved at our engagement party.<br> Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through an ice sculpture, doesn't it? Hi! I went by the photo shop.<br> Take a look.<br> Here is a mockup of our card.<br> What do you think? Looks great.<br> Do you think it should say, "Love, Ross and Mona"? Well, we haven't said that to each other yet but I guess it's okay to say it to others.<br> - How many did you want? I'll get 100.<br> - A hundred? Well, I guess I'll take Mona? I'm not sure about the whole card thing.<br> Really? Why not? Sending out a holiday card together? I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.<br> I didn't think of it that way.<br> You're right.<br> - Can I ask you something? - Yes.<br> Where are we? You know, where are we? Where is this relationship going? I love spending time with you.<br> I just hope we're moving forward.<br> We should talk about that, don't you think? Let's do the card! - What? - The card! I think we're there! Okay.<br> But I still think we should have this talk.<br> Really? Even with the card? Dr.<br> Long can't be here today, so Dr.<br> Schiff will be seeing you.<br> Okay.<br> Can I ask you a question? Was it me, or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? You know who I'm talking about? Bowl haircut, hairy fingers? - Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr.<br> Schiff.<br> - Yes, you are.<br> So, how's it going? Really, really good.<br> But enough about me! Come on.<br> Where are you from? What do you do? - I'm a doctor.<br> - Right.<br> I meant in your spare time.<br> Do you cook? Ski? Or hang out with your wife, or girlfriend? I have no wife or girlfriend, but I do ski.<br> I love to ski! How amazing is this? - Are you experiencing any discomfort? - No, I'm very comfortable.<br> - Any painful gas? - No! Dr.<br> Schiff! What kind of question is that? Would you like to lie down on the table? Would you like me to lie down on the table? - Is there something going on here? - Do you feel it too? - Hi.<br> - How did your doctor's appointment go? Let's see, they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.<br> In the middle of the exam, I put my pinkie in his dimple.<br> - Oh, my God! - Why did you do that? Remember my problem during my fourth month of pregnancy? Oh, yeah! The Evander Holyfield phase.<br> Man! You were so hard up, you practically came on to me.<br> You wish.<br> I could have had you if I wanted you.<br> Oh, yeah? Come and get it.<br> Okay, even this is turning me on.<br> Ross! How's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together? Yeah, we're moving forward.<br> You'll be getting our card.<br> You're doing a holiday card? Not just a card.<br> She wants to talk about where the relationship is going.<br> Women! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation? No man would ask a woman, "So where is this going?" Ross, you asked me that.<br> You were a closed book, okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations.<br> I'm horrible at them.<br> Really.<br> Maybe I need some kind of a gesture that says we're moving forward without talking.<br> Like asking her to move in with you? Smaller than that.<br> - Making her a mix tape? - Bigger than that.<br> - Give her a key to your apartment.<br> - We were closer with the mix tape.<br> Have you said, "I love you"? I don't think I'm quite there yet.<br> But I could say, "I love spending time with you.<br>" - We hate that.<br> - It's a slap in the face.<br> Forget it.<br> You know what? I'll just have the conversation.<br> I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.<br> What do you think, Rach? I think if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.<br> Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.<br> We can't do it.<br> Monica has to work.<br> My ex-wife didn't work.<br> Unless you call turning into her mother "work.<br>" Fine.<br> Tomorrow night then.<br> - Tomorrow's no good for her, either.<br> - Why not? It's the semifinals of her bocce ball tournament.<br> What's going on, Bing? Does your wife have a problem with me or something? Well, now you're just talking crazy.<br> Then why can't we all go out together? Because we split up.<br> Monica and I split up.<br> Hold me.<br> Good God, Bing.<br> Well, I can't say I'm altogether surprised.<br> I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.<br> And the way she looked at me, pure lust.<br> What would really help me through this tough time is choking someone.<br> Bing, my boy, we're gonna get you over this.<br> Here's the plan: We're going to a strip club! Oh, no! Monica would freak.<br> But to hell with that bitch! Here we go.<br> Mona, it's time we had a conversation about where things are with us.<br> Yeah, I think I suggested that.<br> We are so Well, I really like you.<br> And I love hanging out with you.<br> And I'm having a lot of fun.<br> Okay.<br> There's no point in spending time with someone if it's just fun.<br> It's gotta be going somewhere, right? So where is it going? That's the real question.<br> And the answer is it's going somewhere fun.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.<br> But you're not getting any younger.<br> No! I mean, not you.<br> Not you.<br> You are getting younger! You're getting younger by the second.<br> What's your secret? - I'm sorry, so where are we? - Well, to sum up we're having fun.<br> You look young.<br> - Okay - But that's not enough.<br> So here's a key to my apartment.<br> - Really? - Really.<br> You don't think this is too fast? You gave her a key to your apartment? Not just a key.<br> I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship! - Ross, how did the conversation go? - Great.<br> I live on the street.<br> Where? - Hi.<br> - Okay, Monica, Rachel this is my friend Roger.<br> - Hi, Roger.<br> I'll get us some drinks.<br> Could you help me? Yeah, okay.<br> He's here to have sex with you.<br> - What? - You're welcome.<br> - Phoebe, no! - It's okay.<br> He's a virgin.<br> Rachel, I was talking to this guy.<br> I think he'll have sex with you.<br> Let's leave them alone.<br> No! I don't care what my hormones are doing! I won't do it with some guy! Fine! Then you tell Roger, because he was really looking forward to this! Bing! Look at those twin sisters dancing together.<br> Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls.<br> That's all right, sir.<br> And that's just one girl.<br> - Bing, what's this? - It's a hand.<br> You use it as a drink holder.<br> It's a wedding ring.<br> Get rid of it.<br> We'll throw it in the East River! - No! - Yes! I did it, and I felt a lot better! You might even hit a seagull in the head.<br> Okay.<br> I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys.<br> Apparently, I give them away for no reason at all.<br> Ross, what's going on? You're changing the lock? No.<br> That guy is.<br> You give me a key to your apartment, and then you change the lock? Good luck, buddy.<br> I thought we were moving forward.<br> Now you're sending me these mixed signals.<br> What are you trying to tell me? I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.<br> - What? - I love you.<br> And I love spending time with you.<br> - Hi, honey, I'm home.<br> - From the tequila factory? To avoid going to dinner with Doug, I told him you and I split up.<br> So he took me to these sleazy strip clubs.<br> When I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a can at a bird.<br> Come here.<br> I can breathe through my mouth.<br> - Sweetie.<br> - You know what the worst part was? I saw what my life would be without you.<br> It was like "It's a Wonderful Life" with lap dances.<br> Please promise that you'll never leave me that we'll grow old together, and be with each other always.<br> I promise.<br> How about we send out a holiday card together this year? I don't know if we're there yet.<br> I'd like to order a pizza.<br> Can I ask you a question? Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very "Abercrombie & Fitch.<br>" - I'll call you back.<br> - Who was that? - It's just the pizza place.<br> - You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.<br> - Sorry, I'm just having a rough day.<br> - What's wrong? - You don't want to hear about it.<br> - Then why did I ask? Okay, this is embarrassing.<br> Lately, with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself How do I put this? Erotically charged.<br> Is that college talk for "horny"? Yeah.<br> I have all of these feelings, and I don't know what to do.<br> I can't date a normal person.<br> I don't need a relationship.<br> All I really want is one great night! Just sex.<br> No strings attached.<br> No relationship.<br> With someone I feel comfortable with, and who knows what to do.<br> For just one great night.<br> I mean, is that really so hard to find? So how was your day? Good.<br> I saw a pretty big pigeon.<br> I gotta get up early, and it's almost 7:00.<br> - I gotta go to my room.<br> - Good night! Good night! - I can't do it! - I didn't ask you to! - You're Rachel! My friend! - You're Joey! Plus, it would be wrong, and weird and bad! So bad! But I didn't ask you to do anything! I know! - You wanna do it? - No! - I'm just testing you! - No more of this talk! - This talk never happened! - Good night! Good night! Get back in there! Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger.<br> It really wasn't right.<br> And I want to make it up to you.<br> So I brought you something I think you'll really enjoy.<br> Now this is just a loan, okay? I'm gonna want him back.<br> I'm gonna go now.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought I could do it, and I can't.<br>   <br>
