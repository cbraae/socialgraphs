                    			What time is it? Nine.<br> But it's dark out.<br> That's because you always sleep till noon, silly.<br> This is what nine looks like.<br> I guess I'll get washed up then.<br> Watch that sunrise.<br> I'm getting tired of always sneaking around.<br> Me too.<br> What if we went away for the weekend? No interruptions.<br> We could be naked the entire time.<br> All weekend? That's a whole lot of naked.<br> I'll say I have a conference and you can have a chef thing.<br> I wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey! Okay.<br> You know you're not, though.<br> - Let's go.<br> - Okay.<br> Wait.<br> What about Joey? The One with the Kips I'm going to a culinary fair in Jersey this weekend.<br> How weird! Chandler just said he's got a conference there.<br> That's funny.<br> Seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.<br> I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.<br> Do you want people to think it's fake? It's a real conference.<br> - Is Rachel here? - No, she's out shopping.<br> - Damn! - What's going on? I told Emily to come.<br> And I just need to, you know, talk to Rachel about it.<br> Wait a minute.<br> When Emily comes, you won't see Rachel anymore? I'm focusing on the "I get to see my wife" part and not on the part that makes me do this.<br> So you'll never be in a room together? How will that even work? I have no idea.<br> I mean But I assure you, I will figure it out.<br> It doesn't seem like it'll work.<br> Hi, guys.<br> What's going on? We're flipping Monica's mattress.<br> So I'm thinking, basically, we pick it up, and then we flip it.<br> That's better than my way.<br> Hey guys, would you flip mine too? Oh, man.<br> Oh, look! A letter from my mom.<br> So, Rach? You know how Emily's coming? Oh, yeah.<br> I know.<br> Can you hear anything? Yeah, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?" Hey, Joey's ass.<br> What are you doing? Remember when they fought and broke up and we were stuck here all night with no food? When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding, I figured it'd happen again.<br> So I hid this in here.<br> Candy bars, crossword puzzles "Mad Libs"! Mine! Condoms? You don't know how long we'll be in here.<br> We may have to re-populate the Earth.<br> And condoms are the way to do that? Anyway, it all boils down to this.<br> - The last time I talked to Emily - Oh, my God! Our dog died! - What? - Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog! LaPooh's still alive? It says he was hit by an ice-cream truck and dragged for nineteen blocks! - Oh, my God.<br> - Sweetie, we heard you crying.<br> - Please don't cry.<br> - It's LaPooh! I know, it's LaPooh right now but it'll get better.<br> I can't believe it! We're here! Chocolates on the pillows! I love that! You should live with Joey.<br> Rolos everywhere.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Oh, yes! Get in here.<br> It's a high-speed car chase on! We're switching rooms.<br> Oh, dear God! They gave us glasses! The glasses have lipstick on them.<br> Who knows what else they didn't change? Sweetie I just want this weekend to be perfect.<br> We can change rooms, can't we? Okay, but let's do it now.<br> Chopper Five just lost its feed! You know how there was something I wanted to talk to you about? Oh, yeah.<br> I'm trying to work things out with Emily.<br> Well, there's this one thing.<br> Here goes.<br> I made a promise that - What? - Your nose is bleeding.<br> Oh, God! You're bleeding.<br> Not again.<br> This happened when my grandfather died.<br> Sorry.<br> Gross.<br> Okay.<br> So I'm sorry.<br> What did you want to tell me? Sorry.<br> Sorry.<br> I can't see you anymore.<br> I know, it's ridiculous.<br> I can't see you, either.<br> - I think you'll like this room more.<br> - Okay, great.<br> They say he's only got half a tank left.<br> Half a tank? Still lots of high-speed chasing to do! - We're switching rooms again.<br> - What? Why? This has a garden view.<br> We paid for an ocean view.<br> Our last ocean-view room was unacceptable to you.<br> Excuse me.<br> Can I talk to you over here for just a second? These clowns want to take us for a ride.<br> I won't let them.<br> We're not a couple of suckers.<br> I hear you, Mugsy.<br> All these rooms are fine.<br> Just pick one so I can watch the Have a perfect, magical weekend together with you? - This one I like.<br> - Nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> It's over.<br> Damn it! This is regularly scheduled programming! Can we turn the TV off? Do we really want to spend the weekend like this? Am I getting in the way of the room-switching fun? Don't blame me for tonight.<br> Who should I blame? The nice bellman? Or the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on half a tank of gas? Do not speak ill of the dead.<br> We're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together.<br> What's the matter? I just want to watch a little television.<br> Jeez, relax, Mom.<br> What did you say? I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon.<br>" I've been wanting to tell you something and I just have to get it out.<br> Okay.<br> What's up? You know how you said to do whatever it takes to fix my marriage? Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.<br> And while that was good advice, you should know that what she wants is for me not to see you anymore.<br> That's crazy! You can't do that.<br> What are you going to tell her? Oh, my God! You've already agreed to this.<br> It's awful, I know.<br> But I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.<br> And I do.<br> I have to make this marriage work.<br> I have to.<br> But the good thing is, we can still see each other until she gets here.<br> Lucky me! Oh, my God! That is good news, Ross! That's the best news I've heard since LaPooh died! You have no idea what a nightmare this has been.<br> This is so hard.<br> Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross? - Let me make this easier for you.<br> - What are you doing? - Storming out.<br> - It's your apartment.<br> Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am! Damn Rolos! You're back! How was your conference? It was terrible.<br> I fought with my colleagues for the entire time.<br> Are you kidding with this? So your weekend was a bust? No, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.<br> You're back too.<br> Could I talk to you for a second? - How was your chef thing? - It was awful.<br> Some people don't appreciate good food.<br> Maybe the food tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.<br> How much was the room? I'll pay my half.<br> Fine.<br> $300.<br> $300? Just think of it as $25 per room.<br> What are you guys woofing about? Chandler stole a 20 from my purse! You know what? Now that I think about it I constantly find myself without 20s, and you always have lots.<br> You should've seen the look on her face.<br> I don't want Rachel to hate me.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> - You want my advice? - Yes.<br> Please.<br> - You won't like it.<br> - That's okay.<br> You got married too fast.<br> - That's not advice.<br> - I told you.<br> I'm going to the bathroom.<br> If anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.<br> Me neither.<br> Maybe I could do it.<br> I know you guys heard about me and Ross.<br> But I've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it.<br> I don't know if this falls under that category but Ross is right back there.<br> - That's not Ross.<br> - Not that guy.<br> He does look like him, though.<br> Ross is in the bathroom.<br> Oh, my God! It's happening.<br> It's already started.<br> I'm Kip.<br> Yeah, you're not Kip.<br> Do you even know who Kip is? Who cares? You're Rachel.<br> Who's Kip? My old roommate.<br> We all hung out together.<br> Oh, that poor bastard.<br> You told me the story.<br> He and Monica dated.<br> When they broke up, you all promised you'd stay his friend.<br> And what happened? He got phased out.<br> - You won't be phased out.<br> - Of course, I am.<br> It won't happen to Ross.<br> He's your brother, your college roommate.<br> It was just a matter of time.<br> I just assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.<br> You live far away, you're not related.<br> You lift right out.<br> Hey, Mr.<br> Bing.<br> That hotel you stayed at called.<br> Someone left an eyelash curler in your room.<br> Yes, that was mine.<br> I figured you met a girl and she left it.<br> That would have made more sense.<br> I don't even feel like I know you anymore.<br> All right, I'm just going to ask you this one time.<br> Whatever you say, I'll believe you.<br> Were you or were you not on a gay cruise? I'm sorry about the whole "lifting out" thing.<br> You got to come with me.<br> - Where? - Wherever I go.<br> You and me, we'll start a new group.<br> We're the best ones.<br> Okay, but try to get Joey too.<br> Pheebs, do you mind if I speak to Rachel alone? Sure.<br> Bye, Ross.<br> Forever.<br> Why are you here? Isn't this against the rules? I talked to Monica.<br> Look, I'm the one who made the choice.<br> I'm the one who's making things change.<br> So I should be the one to, you know, step back.<br> No, no, it's okay.<br> Really.<br> Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving their college roommates at reunions and Joey at Burger King.<br> Is that better? No, it's not better.<br> I still don't get to see you.<br> What would you do? If you were me, what would you do? First, I'd have said the right name at my wedding.<br> I can't believe this.<br> I know.<br> I am so sorry.<br> I know that too.<br> Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said you want to talk to me about a trip? I just came over to drop off nothing.<br> So that weekend kind of sucked.<br> Yeah, it did.<br> So I guess this is over? You know, you and me.<br> I mean, it had to end sometime.<br> Why exactly? Because of the weekend.<br> We had a fight.<br> Chandler, that's crazy.<br> If you always gave up after a fight you'd never be with anyone longer than This isn't over? You are so cute! No, no.<br> It was a fight.<br> You deal with it and you move on.<br> It's nothing to freak out about.<br> Really? Okay, great! Welcome to an adult relationship.<br> We're in a relationship? I'm afraid so.<br> I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.<br> Saw him waiting for an elevator.<br> Can I use your eyelash curler? I lost mine.<br> It's in the bathroom.<br> Can I talk to you for a second? Yes.<br> Yes.<br> You? And you? But you cannot tell anyone.<br> No one knows.<br> But how? When? - It happened in London.<br> - In London! We didn't want to make a big deal out of it.<br> But it is a big deal! I have to tell someone! You can't.<br> We just don't want to deal with telling everyone.<br> Please just promise you won't tell.<br> All right.<br> Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great! But I know.<br> It's great! I don't want to see that! We're so stupid.<br> Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey! "The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe.<br>" "If you win, slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe'!" That's cute.<br> We really all enjoyed it.<br> - But it doesn't count.<br> - For what? Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs.<br> - I got to go.<br> - Fun's over.<br> Wait, if we follow the rules it's still fun and it means something.<br> I'm going to take off.<br> Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun.<br>   <br>
