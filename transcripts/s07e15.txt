                    			Thanks for coming by.<br> We wanted to bounce some ideas off of you about the wedding ceremony.<br> - What's the matter? Are you okay? - It's just .<br> Monica said "wedding.<br> " We thought one of you could read something.<br> Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.<br> Too? I kind of have something else planned for you guys.<br> - Do you mind telling us what it is? - Sorry.<br> I'm kind of keeping this one on the QT.<br> Whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> I talked to one of the DOOL writers - What is DOOL? -Days Of Our Lives.<br>  You won't believe it.<br> My character is coming out of his coma! - That's wonderful.<br> - Wow, Joey.<br> And not only that.<br> I'm getting a new brain! So great things are happening at work and in your personal life.<br> You're getting a new brain? They're killing off one of the characters and her brain is being transplanted into my body.<br> What? A brain transplant? It's ridiculous.<br> It's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three months.<br> It's winter.<br> There are fewer people on the street.<br> Who are they killing off? Cecilia Monroe.<br> She plays Jessica Lockhart.<br> No! She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces.<br> I don't think I've ever seen her finish a drink.<br> The way she slaps people.<br> Wouldn't you love to? Don't do it.<br> And she's been on the show forever.<br> It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.<br> Help me out here.<br> When you come out of the brain transplant you are going to be her? Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.<br> Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist.<br> The One With Joey's New Brain Rach, so that guy there: Straight or gay? Oh, yeah, he's too cute to be straight.<br> Knockers will help us figure it out.<br> All right, straight.<br> And not subtle.<br> He left his cell phone.<br> We could have Gunther put it in lost and found.<br> Or we could use it to call China, see how those guys are doing.<br> What if he calls his own cell phone and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love? Would that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.<br> That does sound great.<br> I'm getting the phone.<br> What? Wait.<br> Why do you get the story? I haven't been out on a date in so long.<br> Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.<br> That wasn't a date.<br> That was friends getting together and having sex.<br> Okay.<br> Great.<br> I get the phone.<br> No way.<br> You just broke up with Tag a week ago.<br> Yeah, and until now, I didn't think I would love again.<br> - Nice try.<br> - Wait.<br> How do we fairly decide who gets the phone? I don't know.<br> Maybe we could .<br> Ah-ha! Too slow! Ah-ha! Too cocky.<br> I'm dating him.<br> There's nothing you can do.<br> Yes, there is.<br> Are you going to kill him like you did Charles? Oh, my baby.<br> Cut!  That was great.<br> And that slap looked so real.<br> How do you do that? - Oh, just years of experience.<br> - Can I get some ice here?! I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.<br> You're not the fan who's dying, are you? I'm Joey Tribbiani.<br> We did a scene together yesterday.<br> - I'm the guy in the coma.<br> - Oh, that was a real person? Since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show I was wondering if - I'm leaving the show? - Why? Did you hear something? Who told you that? - One of the writers.<br> - Was it bald or was it tall? You know, it doesn't matter, because it is not true.<br> Okay.<br> And if it were true, how dare you come to me and ask me for tips about a character I've played for 20 years! Miss Monroe Oh, there you go.<br> Okay, look, I have an idea.<br> Why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial and then whoever has more in common with him gets the phone.<br> - Fine.<br> All right.<br> - All right.<br> First name on the speed dial is "Mom.<br> " Oh.<br> I lost my mom to suicide.<br> You can't use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.<br> Did I use that already today? Sorry.<br> "Ben, Carlos, David" Oh, I win.<br> He's got Barney's on his speed dial.<br> You don't know it's Barney's the store.<br> That could be his friend's house, a bar Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial? His new girlfriend.<br> What is that? I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.<br> Sounds like it's coming from across the street.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - What? The thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding? He was hanging out with me and said, "You're half Scottish, right?" No.<br> There is no way.<br> It cannot be Ross.<br> Unbelievable.<br> Why is your family Scottish? Why is your family Ross? He cannot play at our wedding.<br> I mean, come on.<br> That is just noise! It's not even a song.<br> Wait.<br> If you listen very carefully I think it's "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang.<br> You're right.<br> They are writing me out of the show.<br> They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but soon and then that's it.<br> If it was up to me, you would never leave the show.<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> - I mean it.<br> I can't believe they'd do this to you.<br> And to your fans.<br> They're gonna be devastated.<br> Heartbroken.<br> They love you so much.<br> Oh, you're right.<br> Thank you.<br> What's your name again? - Joey.<br> - Thank you.<br> That is so sweet.<br> The only reason I came up to you before is because, well I'm really nervous about being you.<br> If you could help me capture the essence of the character .<br> Help me keep Jessica alive.<br> Please? Joey, I will help you.<br> Not because I owe it to this stupid show but because I owe it to Jessica.<br> - Oh, thank you so much.<br> - You're so welcome.<br> I've been watching some tapes.<br> How's this? Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Never! Jessica doesn't have an English accent.<br> I can do an English accent? That baby's going on my resume.<br> - Hi.<br> How are you? - Good.<br> Remember when we were in the coffeehouse we decided I was gonna keep the cute guy's phone? I was gonna keep it in my purse, so if it rang, I could just pick it up? Do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone? Ooh, now you lost me.<br> - You stole the phone.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> You're saying if I called it, it wouldn't ring? - No.<br> - Okay.<br> But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.<br> Oh, it does work.<br> - Phoebe.<br> - That is a different phone.<br> Oh, is it? Hello.<br> Yes, hi.<br> Is Rachel there? Yes, she is.<br> Just one moment, please.<br> It's for me! That is damning evidence.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I bet that's him.<br> My digital fairy tale's about to begin.<br> Would you stop doing that? Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.<br> - Phoebe, you can't - Shh, I'm on a call.<br> Yeah, you can pick it up tonight.<br> Say, 8:30? At my apartment.<br> It's 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.<br> And then maybe, you know, after, we can grab a bite to eat or whatever.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, I'll see you then.<br> Bye.<br> I will be here when he comes over.<br> How will you know what time to come over? You just said it.<br> Oh.<br> The essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.<br> So when Jessica enters a room, for instance she owns everything and every person in that room.<br> - You try it.<br> - Okay.<br> He's not mad at the room.<br> Try it again.<br> He owns it.<br> He owns the room.<br> It is his.<br> He owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it! It's a little weird, but it's getting better.<br> I'm gonna miss this woman so much.<br> I don't know what I'm gonna do.<br> It's been 20 years of my life.<br> Hey, hey.<br> Maybe this is a good thing.<br> It'll give you a chance to shake things up.<br> Play different characters.<br> You're so talented.<br> Probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in but I just got so comfy here and .<br> I turned down some amazing work.<br> Like what? Well, let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today.<br> Wow.<br> But, well, now .<br> Now's a different time for me.<br> Oh, hey, come on.<br> Don't do this.<br> Let me tell you something, okay? When I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "She is a great actress.<br> " But I'm also thinking, "She is hot.<br> " You think I'm hot? You own the room.<br> We should probably get the .<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Yeah, we should get So when Jessica kisses a man she usually puts both her hands on the man's face.<br> I notice that.<br> Is that because she's so passionate? No, it's because that way the camera only sees her.<br> You want to try it? Yeah, okay.<br> That was good.<br> That was really good.<br> But I think that maybe your hands are just a little off.<br> They should Well, I feel like a snack.<br> Do you want some shortbread? It's Scottish, like you are.<br> Oh, no, thanks.<br> I don't like anything from my Scottish heritage.<br> What? Well, it's just that my entire family was run out of Scotland by Vikings.<br> It sounds like your family's ready to rediscover its Scottish roots.<br> You can't play bagpipes at the wedding! How did you know? - We heard you play from our apartment.<br> - Were you the ones who called the cops? That's not really important right now.<br> What is important is, while we appreciate the gesture we just don't feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.<br> - Why not? - Because we hate them.<br> Just give me a chance to perform for you, then decide whatever you want.<br> I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play, either.<br> Let's just say when it's over I'll bet there'll be a wee bit o' celebration.<br> Hey, hey! Who is it? It's Tom.<br> I'm here to pick up the phone.<br> Why do you get to answer the door? - Why shouldn't I? - Because it's my apartment.<br> Then I get to give him the phone.<br> Okay.<br> Good luck explaining all the calls to China.<br> Hi.<br> Wow, how long were we arguing for? You're not the man who left the phone.<br> - No, that's my assistant.<br> - Is he coming? No.<br> - Could you give us one second? - Sure.<br> We'll be right back, sir.<br> - What do we do? - I don't know.<br> Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and a hotter one shows up.<br> I know What? Rachel, listen if you let me have him, then I will really owe you one.<br> All right.<br> All right, I will let you have him.<br> But you owe me.<br> You owe me big.<br> Which one of you will I take to dinner? Oh, that'd be me, sir.<br> Nice.<br>  Well, you certainly own that room.<br> Actually, I rent the whole place.<br> I just got what you meant.<br> Thank you.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, Jessica Lockhart! In my apartment! I am such a huge fan.<br> I am such a huge fan.<br> It's nice to know Monica! That's my roommate, Rachel.<br> That explains the women's underwear.<br> Sure.<br> Oh, my God, it's true! Can I just ask you to do me just one favor? Certainly.<br> Would you slap me right here in the face? I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.<br> All right, here we go.<br> No, wait.<br> Just one moment.<br> - You're a stupid bitch.<br> - I really can't slap you.<br> - My God, you're great.<br> - Thanks for stopping by.<br> - I am so sorry about that.<br> - Oh, no.<br> Being adored, I'm used to it.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - What? They sent me today's script.<br> They never send me the script.<br> - They don't? - I'm in a coma.<br> This must mean I have lines.<br> Oh.<br> How does it happen? You get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.<br> A what? Jessica hates horses.<br> After this she's not gonna be crazy about electricity, either.<br> Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse was brilliant, Fredrick.<br> And the electric fence, inspired.<br> Thank you, sweetheart.<br> I can't believe she's really gone.<br> Look around you.<br> All of this is ours.<br> I don't think so.<br> Who are you? What's the matter, Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother? Cut! That was great, everybody.<br>  Thank you.<br>  That was so wonderful! I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Of course not, but you were good.<br> Thanks.<br> Good news.<br> I got another job.<br> Great.<br> Hey, all right! What is it? A film in Guadalajara.<br> The airport? No, that's LaGuardia.<br> - This is Mexico.<br> - Oh, wow.<br> Well, how long will you be gone? Eight months.<br> - That's a really long time.<br> - Yeah, but you could come and visit.<br> I bet you could own a few places down there.<br> Oh, you know, I should probably buy a place in the city first.<br> And I just got what you meant.<br> That is - That's a tricky one.<br> - It's tricky.<br> Good luck.<br> You too.<br> Now, remember, I'm still learning.<br> One, two, three, four! You know this song.<br> Sing along.<br> So? No!   <br>
