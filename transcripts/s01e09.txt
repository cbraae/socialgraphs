Almost never.<br> -Got the keys? -Okay.<br> Anytime you' re ready.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, here we go.<br> Okay.<br> Where am I talking to here?

That tone won't make me go any faster.<br> -Joey.<br> -That one will.<br> And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major.<br> " So on a dare, I picked paleontology.<br> And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, face it, you' re a fetus.<br> You're happy you don't have gills anymore.<br> You don't have to talk to it.<br> You can sing Please.<br> I am not singing to your stomach, okay? How's it going? Here we come Walking down the street Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet Hey, hey -Hey, did you just feel that? -I did.<br> -Does it always? -That was the first.<br> IKeep singing!

No, I didn't! I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys! That's it! Enough with the keys.<br> No one say keys! Why would I have the keys?! -Aside from the fact you said you did? -I didn't! -You should've.<br> -Why? -Because! -Why? Everything's my responsibility? Isn't it enough that l' m making dinner? Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making them.<br> Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? No! No! No! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his T ots It's my first Thanksgiving, and l It's all burnt, and I can't.<br> Monica, only dogs can hear you now.<br> Look, the door's open.<br> Here we go.<br> -All right, Chandler, don't lose this.<br> -No Well, the turkey's burnt!

Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.<br> You got the bigger half! What did you wish for? The bigger half.<br> All right, I'd like to propose a toast.<br> A little toast here.<br> Ding, ding! This isn't the Thanksgiving you planned but for me, this has been really great.<br> I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.<br> If you'd gone to Vail or if you had been with your family or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be together.<br> I guess what l' m trying to say is that  I' m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.<br> -That's so sweet! -Thank you.<br> -Here's to a lousy Christmas! -And a crappy New Year! -Hear, hear! -Hear, hear!   <br>
