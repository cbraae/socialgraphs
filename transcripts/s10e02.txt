                    			Okay, Ross.<br> I realize that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but - Let me explain, okay? - We weren't doing anything! Rach, he just saw us.<br> But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.<br> - That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.<br> - Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados but we didn't plan it.<br> The only reason that that happened was because I saw you kiss Charlie.<br> Yeah, you started it! I have got to chill.<br> Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened.<br> - But - Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.<br> Yeah.<br> But it did happen.<br> So Ross? Ross? Can we just close the door? The One Where Ross Is Fine Ross, say something.<br> Anything.<br> So you two are? - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> And have you had? - No.<br> No, no, no.<br> - No.<br> No.<br> But if I hadn't walked in here, would you? Probably No.<br> No.<br> Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.<br> You have every right to go nuts.<br> I'm not going nuts.<br> Do you see me going nuts? No, but you know what I mean.<br> If you two are happy then I'm happy for you.<br> I'm fine.<br> - Really? - Absolutely.<br> I'm fine.<br> Totally fine.<br> I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky because, really, I'm fine.<br> I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing.<br> I mean, at first I was like: But now that I've had time to absorb it Loving this.<br> - Ross - It's all working out.<br> Me and Charlie.<br> And you two.<br> - You know what we should do? - Calm ourselves? No.<br> We should all have dinner.<br> Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.<br> I'll cook! Look, don't you think that would be a little weird? Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food because I'm making fajitas! I do like fajitas.<br> God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming.<br> There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.<br> There's so many ways to go, and this is, like, the biggest decision of our lives.<br> There's a hair in my coffee.<br> Hey, guys.<br> Have you seen Frank Jr.<br>? He's meeting me here with the triplets.<br> It's funny, every time you say "triplets" I think of three hot, blond 19-year-olds.<br> That's sweet.<br> Drink your hair.<br> Hey, what's all this stuff? They're brochures from different adoption agencies.<br> Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.<br> Get this one.<br> That's not really how it works.<br> - Oh, how does it work? - I don't know! If you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends Bill and Colleen.<br> They adopted a kid.<br> I'm sure they'd help you.<br> Thanks, that would be great.<br> Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great? All right, all right.<br> Remember what we talked about.<br> When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.<br> That's not what we talked about! - Hi, Frank.<br> - Hi.<br> - Good to see you.<br> - Good to see you too.<br> - Hi, Frank.<br> - Hi.<br> Hey, how you doing? Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big.<br> Which one is which again? Well, that's Frank Jr.<br> Jr pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse.<br> And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler.<br> That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.<br> "Willing to adopt triplets?" No.<br> Can I just say, I know we're doing this for Ross and that's cool.<br> But if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.<br> Well, what would we be doing? I'd take you out for a romantic night.<br> Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home.<br> Feel me up? In a carriage.<br> - Hey, Charlie! - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> So dreading this? - Oh, you bet.<br> So did you bring a little something for Ross? Actually, it's some stuff you left at my apartment.<br> Well, thanks.<br> And you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.<br> Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.<br> I thought I heard voices.<br> Hi, Charlie.<br> Hey, Joey.<br> And, oh, you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.<br> I'm just kidding.<br> I know Rachel.<br> I know Come.<br> Please come in.<br> Come in.<br> Okay.<br> Well, we brought you some wine.<br> That is so thoughtful.<br> She's a keeper.<br> - And what did you bring me, huh? - Actually, that's Underwear, a toothbrush and a Van Halen CD.<br> I can use all these things! Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little What? Fine? Because I am.<br> Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't? You see? Who else is fine? Come on.<br> Listen.<br> Why don't you try to relax.<br> Maybe have a drink.<br> You know what, that is a very good idea.<br> I'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.<br> Oh, God.<br> So adorable.<br> Look at them, sleeping there like angels.<br> Yeah, I really cherish these moments because before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.<br> Well, they may be a handful but they're so cute.<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, God, last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing.<br> I haven't slept in four years.<br> That's a long time.<br> You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe.<br> There's just so many of them.<br> You know, two I could handle.<br> Two's great.<br> You just hold one in each hand.<br> What do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on? I got no more hands to protect my area.<br> There's three of them, Phoebe.<br> Three.<br> Yeah, I know, Frank.<br> I counted them when they were coming out of my area.<br> Sometimes, I think that Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.<br> It's too horrible.<br> No.<br> What? No, no, I can't.<br> Oh, my God, Frank.<br> Are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could run out on them.<br> Oh, no, I would never do that.<br> No.<br> I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.<br> What? You can't separate them, that's terrible! Which one? Thank you so much for seeing us.<br> Phoebe has told us great things about you guys.<br> Please, we're happy to help.<br> We went through the same thing when we were adopting.<br> So a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh? I mean, you have a lovely home.<br> We appreciate anything you can tell us.<br> Well, actually, I think this might help.<br> It's pretty much all the information you need.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> Everything is broken into categories, then cross-referenced.<br> Then color-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.<br> Thank you.<br> I think I just had a tiny orgasm.<br> I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.<br> Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.<br> That's great.<br> Can I see the book? You want me to wash my hands first, don't you? Please.<br> It's just so pretty and white.<br> Bathroom is down the hall to your left.<br> I would have told him to do it too.<br> Can I adopt you? - Hey, you must be Owen.<br> - Yeah.<br> I'm Chandler.<br> Hey, I was in the Scouts too.<br> - You were? - In fact, my father was a den mother.<br> You know how to use a compass? I have a badge in it.<br> - You do? That's fantastic.<br> - You want to see it? I'd love to, but I gotta get back to your parents.<br> They're telling us about how they adopted you.<br> What? What? I'm adopted? I got nothing.<br> Well, that first batch of margaritas was not so great but this second batch is good.<br> Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.<br> Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it? You know, just the four of us.<br> Just hanging.<br> Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready? I'm fine, okay? I'm great.<br> I'm just I'm just proud of us.<br> You know? There's no weirdness, no tension.<br> No awareness.<br> We make a great foursome.<br> We should do more stuff together.<br> Let's take a trip! Okay, where do you think we can go? My fajitas! Look, Charlie, I just want you to know Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.<br> You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.<br> You know what, this is nothing.<br> My father is a raging alcoholic.<br> I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable? Fajitas! Be careful! Very hot plate! Very hot! Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on.<br> That is gonna hurt tomorrow.<br> Okay, well, this is crazy.<br> We can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we? Oh, no, of course we're not.<br> - That's insane.<br> - I know.<br> Alice would never go for it.<br> She's pretty tired too.<br> I think we could get her on board.<br> Well, just for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically which one would you be willing to give up? Frank Jr.<br> Jr.<br>? You'd be getting a really good one.<br> I mean, you know, he's really funny.<br> Like, the other day, he made up this joke: What's green and says, "Hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog.<br> Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.<br> Well, all right, that's fine.<br> What about Leslie? Oh, no, no, not Leslie.<br> No.<br> She's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.<br> All right, so that leaves Chandler.<br> No, no, you can't have Chandler.<br> No, no.<br> She's my little genius.<br> I got big hopes for her.<br> She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.<br> Wow, Frank, I think we just ran out of kids.<br> Oh, I think you're right.<br> Oh, wow.<br> Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up.<br> I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.<br> I'm sorry, Frank, I didn't realize things were so bad.<br> You know, I'll help out more.<br> I can babysit anytime you want.<br> You name the day and I'll be there.<br> - How about tomorrow? - Well, that's not good.<br> But I can move some stuff around and I'll be there.<br> You and Alice just take the whole day together.<br> You'd do that for us? Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.<br> Oh, look at them.<br> I love you so much.<br> Oh, crap, don't wake up! Don't wake up! - Where are Bill and Colleen? - Kitchen, getting something to eat.<br> Can you believe how nice they are? We have to leave.<br> Why? What did you do in the bathroom? I didn't get to the bathroom.<br> I bumped into Owen on the way.<br> He didn't know he was adopted.<br> There's a slight chance I may have told him.<br> Oh, my God, where's my purse? No, I can replace everything in there.<br> - Get that binder and let's go! - Hi.<br> Some little snacks for everybody.<br> You don't have to eat the sour worms.<br> Those are for Owen.<br> I'll go get him in a second.<br> By the way, you should know, we haven't told him he's adopted yet.<br> But kids are so intuitive.<br> Don't you think, on some level, he already knows? - I'm adopted? - See? Intuitive.<br> What? Where did you hear that? He told me.<br> And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.<br> Which, technically, now you should give back.<br> You told him he's adopted? I'm sorry.<br> You should have a sign out there or something.<br> Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.<br> "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks Santa is real.<br>" He isn't? We have to get out of here, baby.<br> Everyone, I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.<br> And to love.<br> Ah, love! L-O-V-E.<br> Love.<br> L is for "life.<br>" And what is life without love? Oh, my God, are we supposed to answer? O is for: "Oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events which I am still fine with, by the way.<br> E is for how extremely normal I find it that you two are together.<br> And that one day you might get married and have children of your own.<br> - Dude, are you okay? - Totally.<br> Ross, you don't seem okay.<br> I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining.<br> I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.<br> Wait, Ross.<br> Ross, l I have to take off.<br> - No! - I'm sorry.<br> I have an early class in the morning.<br> But this has been lovely.<br> Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey.<br> And that you never really liked Rachel.<br> You are on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay? - Okay.<br> - All right.<br> God, Rachel, what Ross just said, that's just That's okay.<br> Girls tend not to like me.<br> Fine.<br> Okay.<br> I guess it's just flan for three.<br> Hey, that rhymes.<br> You know what, Ross, I think we're gonna take off too.<br> Of course.<br> God, I'm so stupid.<br> You guys are a couple now.<br> I mean, you probably just want to be alone.<br> - No, it's just getting late - It's fine.<br> It's totally fine.<br> I've got plenty of margaritas.<br> It's all good.<br> I don't even know what that's for.<br> You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.<br> - That's probably a good idea.<br> - I'll see you in the morning.<br> Okay.<br> Yeah, you know, Joey, l I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.<br> It doesn't look good, does it? Morning.<br> - Here you go.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Did you stay here all night? - Yeah.<br> So you took off my pants and shoes? No.<br> No, no.<br> You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.<br> Look, Ross about Rachel and I.<br> Listen, you don't have to worry about that because nothing's gonna happen.<br> What do you mean? She and I said from the beginning we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it.<br> And clearly What are you talking about? I'm fine.<br> It's okay, Ross.<br> You know, I totally understand.<br> Of course you're not fine.<br> You're You're Ross and Rachel.<br> Yeah, except we're not.<br> I mean, we haven't been a couple in, like six years.<br> My God, is that right? Has it been that long? That's what I hear, yeah.<br> This is crazy.<br> I mean, six years and because of me, you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really what is this thing with you and Rachel? Come on, you know me.<br> You know Joey.<br> I'm crazy about her.<br> And she feels the same way? I think so.<br> Well, then maybe it's time we all moved on.<br> Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it, so No, but I want to be.<br> I will be.<br> Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh, my God, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? - She didn't see the dance, did she? - No, no, no.<br> No, that was That was just for me.<br> Hey, you? You sure about this? Yeah, I'm sure.<br> And we're okay? - Hey, Pheebs.<br> - Hey.<br> We just want to give you a heads up.<br> Bill and Colleen hate us.<br> Owen didn't know he's adopted and Monica told him.<br> What? Still, he had to find out sometime.<br> How would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them? I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.<br>   <br>
