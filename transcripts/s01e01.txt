                    			The One Where It All Began (Pilot) There's nothing to tell.<br> It's just some guy I work with.<br> You're going out with the guy.<br> There has to be something wrong with him.<br> All right, Joey.<br> Be nice.<br> So does he have a hump and a hairpiece? Wait, does he eat chalk? I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl.<br> Okay, everybody relax.<br> This is not even a date.<br> It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.<br> Sounds like a date to me.<br> I'm in high school, in the cafeteria.<br>.<br> and I realize I'm totally naked.<br> I've had that dream.<br> Then I look down and I realize there is a phone.<br>.<br> there.<br> - Instead of - That's right! Never had that one.<br> All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.<br> What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me.<br> They weren't looking at you before? Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.<br> And it turns out it's my mother.<br> Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.<br> Hi.<br> He says, "Hello," I want to kill myself.<br> You okay? I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth.<br>.<br> - and tied it around my neck.<br> - Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today.<br> - Let me get you some coffee.<br> - Thanks.<br> No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.<br> - Just leave my aura alone, okay? - Fine, be murky.<br> - I'll be fine.<br> I hope she'll be happy.<br> - No, you don't.<br> No, I don't.<br> To hell with her.<br> She left me! You never knew she was a lesbian? No! Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know.<br> How should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.<br> Did I say that out loud? I told Mom and Dad last night.<br> They took it pretty well.<br> Oh, really? So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing.<br>.<br> "I'll never have grandchildren," was what? A wrong number? Sorry.<br> Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.<br> You're angry.<br> You're hurting.<br> Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joints! Hey, you're single.<br> Have some hormones.<br> But I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again.<br> And I just want a million dollars! - Rachel? - Oh, Monica! Thank God! I went to your building.<br>.<br> and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.<br> - Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf.<br> Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor.<br> This is everybody.<br> Chandler and Phoebe.<br>.<br> Joey.<br> Remember my brother, Ross? Sure! You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.<br> I was in the room with all the presents.<br>.<br> and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.<br> When all of a sudden Sweet 'N Low? I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.<br> I got freaked out, and it hit me: How much Barry looks like Mr.<br> Potato Head.<br> I always knew he looked familiar, but.<br>.<br> I had to get out of there, and I started wondering.<br>.<br> "Why am I doing this," and "Who am I doing it for?" I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart.<br>.<br> but you're the only person I know here.<br> - Who wasn't invited to the wedding.<br> - I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.<br> I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.<br> "Tuna or egg salad! Decide!" "I'll have whatever Christina's having.<br>" Daddy, I just I can't marry him.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I just don't love him.<br> Well, it matters to me! "If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.<br>" She should not be wearing those pants.<br> Push her down the stairs! Push her! Push her down the stairs! Come on, Daddy, listen! All my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe!" "You're a shoe!" What if I don't want to be a shoe? What if I want to be a purse? Or a hat? No, I don't want you to buy me a hat! It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where he'd have trouble.<br> Look, Daddy, it's my life.<br> Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.<br> I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.<br> Well, maybe that's my decision.<br> Maybe I don't need your money.<br> Wait! I said maybe! Just breathe.<br> That's it.<br> Try to think of nice, calm things.<br> Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens La la la something And noodles with string I'm all better now.<br> I helped.<br> This is probably for the best.<br> Independence.<br> Controlling your life.<br> The whole hat thing.<br> You can always come to Joey.<br> Me and Chandler live across the hall.<br> He's away a lot.<br> Stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day.<br> Like there's a rule, or something? I got it.<br> Please don't do that again.<br> It's a horrible sound.<br> It's Paul.<br> Oh, God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in.<br> - Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy? Maybe.<br> Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy? - He finally asked you out? - Yes! It's a "Dear Diary" moment.<br> - Rach, I can cancel.<br> - Please, go, I'll be fine.<br> Ross, are you okay? Do you want me to stay? That'd be good.<br> - Really?- Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy! Does he sell it, drink it? Or he just complains a lot? Hi, come in! Paul, this is.<br>.<br> everybody.<br> Everybody, this is Paul.<br> - The wine guy.<br> - I didn't catch your name.<br> Paul? I'll be right back.<br> I've just gotta go A-wandering? Change.<br> Sit down.<br> Two seconds.<br> I just pulled out four eyelashes.<br> That can't be good.<br> Hey, Paul, here's a tip.<br> She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot.<br>.<br> until it starts to get red.<br> Shut up, Joey! What are you up to tonight? I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon.<br>.<br> so, nothing.<br> Right.<br> You're not even getting your honeymoon.<br> Although, Aruba.<br> This time of year? Talk about your.<br>.<br> big lizards.<br> If you don't want to be alone tonight.<br>.<br> Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.<br> We're very excited about it.<br> Thanks.<br> But I'm just going to hang out here.<br> - It's been a long day.<br> - Oh, sure.<br> Phoebe, wanna help? I wish I could, but I don't want to.<br> Love is sweet as summer showers Love is a wondrous work of art But your love Oh, your love, your love Is like a giant pigeon Crapping on my heart Thank you.<br> I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things.<br>.<br> using a bunch of these little worm guys.<br> I have no bracket-y thing.<br> I see no worm guys whatsoever.<br>.<br> and I cannot feel my legs.<br> - We got a bookcase.<br> - It's beautiful.<br> What's this? I would have to say that is an L-shaped bracket.<br> - Which goes where? - I have no idea.<br> - Done with the bookcase.<br> - All finished.<br> This was Carol's favorite beer.<br> She always drank it out of the can.<br> I should have known.<br> - Start with that, we're out of here.<br> - Please don't spoil all this fun.<br> Let me ask you.<br> She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.<br> What did you get? - You guys.<br> - You got screwed.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - I know.<br> I'm such an idiot.<br> I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week.<br> I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that.<br> How did you get over it? He might accidentally break something valuable of hers.<br> - Say her - Leg? That's one way of doing it.<br> I went for the watch.<br> You actually broke her watch? The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel.<br> - Steer clear of you.<br> - That's right.<br> Barry, I'm sorry.<br> I am so sorry.<br> You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.<br> It's about me.<br> And I just The machine cut me off again.<br> Anyway.<br>.<br> I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs.<br> Barry Finkel.<br> But it isn't me.<br> It's not me.<br> Not that I have any idea who "me" is right now, but you just I'm divorced.<br> - I'm only 26, and I'm divorced! - Shut up! That only took me an hour.<br> We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento.<br> You have had the love of a woman for four years.<br> Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out.<br> That is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point! Know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody? I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it? Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.<br> What are you talking about? One woman.<br> That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> There's lots of flavors out there.<br> Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.<br> You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.<br> It's the best thing to happen to you! You got married.<br> You were like, what, 8? Welcome back to the world.<br> Grab a spoon! - I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.<br> - Then stay out of my freezer.<br> Ever since she walked out on me.<br>.<br> What? You wanna spell it out with noodles? It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.<br> So there's going to be a fifth date? Isn't there? Yeah, yeah.<br> I think there is.<br> What were you going to say? Ever since she left me.<br>.<br> I haven't been able to perform.<br>.<br> sexually.<br> Oh, God! I'm so sorry.<br> Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.<br> How long? - Two years.<br> - Wow.<br> I'm glad you smashed her watch.<br> So you still think you might want that fifth date? Yeah.<br> Yeah, I do.<br> We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham.<br>.<br> and Charles.<br> Chachi, Chachi, Chachi.<br>.<br> in the bonds of holy matrimony.<br> See! But Joanie loved Chachi.<br> That's the difference.<br> "Grab a spoon.<br>" Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon? Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you? Great story.<br> But I gotta go.<br> I got a date with Andrea.<br> Angela.<br> No, Andrea.<br> Andrea's the screamer.<br> Angela has cats.<br> Right, thanks.<br> It's Julie.<br> I'm out of here.<br> Here's the thing.<br> Even if I could get it together enough.<br>.<br> to ask a woman out.<br>.<br> who am I going to ask? Isn't this amazing? I've never made coffee in my life.<br> - That is amazing.<br> - Congratulations.<br> If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.<br> I think it's, "If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do.<br>" If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something.<br>.<br> Although, actually I'm really not that hungry.<br> Oh, good.<br> Lenny and Squiggy are here.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Morning.<br> - Morning, Paul.<br> - Hello, Paul.<br> - Hi.<br> Paul, is it? - Thank you so much.<br> - Stop.<br> Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations.<br>.<br> plus the barn-raising scene in Witness.<br> We'll talk later.<br> Thank you.<br> That wasn't a real date.<br> What the hell do you do on a real date? Shut up and put my table back.<br> I've got to get to work.<br> If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.<br> So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs.<br> That's how we buy stuff.<br> - Yeah, I'm an actor.<br> - Have I seen you in anything? I doubt it.<br> Mostly regional work.<br> Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.<br>.<br> at the little theater in the park? It was a job! "Look, Geppetto.<br> I'm a real live boy.<br>" - I will not take this abuse.<br> - You're right, I'm sorry.<br> Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy You should both know that he's a dead man.<br> Oh, Chandler! How are you doing today? Sleep okay? Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.<br> I see that.<br> You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.<br> I know.<br> He's just so.<br>.<br> - Remember you and Tony Demarco? - Oh, yeah.<br> Well, it's like that.<br> With feelings.<br> - Wow, are you in trouble! - Big time! Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.<br> I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.<br> I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day.<br> Or else I'm going to get up and go to work.<br> - Wish me luck! - What for? I'm gonna go get one of those job things.<br> - Hi, Monica.<br> - Franny, welcome back.<br> - How was Florida? - You had sex, didn't you? - How do you do that? - I hate you.<br> I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.<br> So, who? You know Paul? Paul, the wine guy? Yeah, I know Paul.<br> You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul? What? I take credit for Paul.<br> Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.<br> Of course it was a line.<br> Why would anybody do something like that? I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than: "To get you into bed.<br>" I hate men.<br> Don't hate.<br> You don't want to put that out into the universe.<br> Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs.<br>.<br> and men with emotional problems can hear? Come here.<br> Give me your feet.<br> I just thought he was nice, you know? I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.<br> - Guess what? - You got a job? Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing.<br> - I was laughed out of 12 interviews.<br> - You're surprisingly upbeat.<br> You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale.<br>.<br> How well you know me.<br> They're my "I don't need a job.<br>.<br> I've got great boots" boots.<br> - How did you pay? - Credit card.<br> And who pays for that? My father.<br> Is this really necessary? I can stop charging any time.<br> You can't live off your parents.<br> I know that.<br> That's why I was getting married.<br> Give her a break.<br> It's hard being on your own.<br> Thank you.<br> I remember when I first came to this city, I was 14.<br> Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail.<br> I didn't know anybody here.<br> I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.<br> And then he killed himself.<br> Then I found aromatherapy.<br> So I know exactly how you feel.<br> The word you're looking for is: "Anyway.<br>.<br>" - You ready? - No, how can I be ready? "Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?" - I can't do this.<br> - I know you can.<br> - No.<br> - You made coffee, you can do anything.<br> Cut.<br> Cut.<br> Cut.<br> You know what? I think we can leave it at that.<br> - Kind of a symbolic gesture.<br> - Rachel, that was a library card.<br> If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.<br> Welcome to the real world! It sucks.<br> You're gonna love it.<br> That's it.<br> Are you going to crash on the couch? - No, I gotta go home sometime.<br> - Are you gonna be okay? Look what I just found on the floor.<br> What? That's Paul's watch.<br> Just put it back where you found it.<br> Oh, boy! All right.<br> - Good night, everybody.<br> - Good night.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> Have it, I don't want it.<br> - Split it? You probably didn't know this, but in high school.<br>.<br> I had a major crush on you.<br> I knew.<br> You did? I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.<br> I did.<br> Listen, do you think.<br>.<br>? Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here.<br> Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime? Yeah.<br> Maybe.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, maybe I will.<br> - Good night.<br> - Good night.<br> See you.<br> Wait, wait.<br> What's with you? I just grabbed a spoon.<br> - I can't believe what I'm hearing.<br> - Can't believe what I'm hearing - What? I said -  What? I said - Would you stop? - Was I doing it again? Yes! I said you had a nice butt.<br> It's just not a great butt.<br> - You won't know a butt if it bit you.<br> - There's an image.<br> Would anybody like more coffee? You made it, or you're serving it? - I'm just serving it.<br> - I'll have a cup of coffee.<br> Kids, new dream.<br> I'm in Las Vegas.<br> Miss, more coffee? Could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead.<br> Thank you.<br> Sorry.<br> Okay, Las Vegas.<br> I'm in Las Vegas.<br> I'm Liza Minnelli.<br>.<br>   <br>
