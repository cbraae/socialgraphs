                    			- I'm ready.<br> - You sure? Let me just straighten out your helmet there.<br> - Thanks, Daddy.<br> - No, no.<br> One daddy, two mommies.<br> - All right, it's all yours.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> There you go, there you go.<br> Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike.<br> This is so exciting! Oh, yeah, I remember mine.<br> It was my sixth birthday.<br> I went to the park and I got on it and it bent.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I never had a bike of my own.<br> - What? We didn't have a lot of money.<br> But the girl across the street had the best bike.<br> It was pink and it had rainbow-colored tassels hanging off the handles and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.<br> That sounds like my first bike.<br> My dad gave me his old one.<br> - Did the girl ever let you ride it? - No.<br> But she gave me the box that it came in.<br> It had a picture of the bike on the front.<br> So I would sit on it and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard.<br> That is so unfair.<br> Not really, I got to drag him around too.<br> The One With All the Candy Hey, what are you guys doing? Making candy for the neighbors.<br> I'm sorry, who? I'm gonna hang a basket on the door.<br> When the neighbors walk by, they can take a piece.<br> - But we don't know the neighbors.<br> - I do.<br> There's, let's see, the guy with the mustache smokes-a-lot lady, some kids I've seen and the red-haired guy who does not like to be called Rusty.<br> See, this is exactly why I'm making this candy.<br> We can get to know our neighbors.<br> Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved? Good morning! - Somebody's in a good mood.<br> - Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends.<br> I have a wonderful job Where you can make out with your assistant.<br> It's not a big deal.<br> We stayed up creating a plan so that us dating won't be a problem.<br> Oh, yeah? What's the plan? We We are not going to let it be a problem.<br> It took you all night to come up with that plan? Well, you know, we did other stuff too.<br> Did you two? Oh, I don't sleep with guys on the first date.<br> - Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise - Anymore! Hi, Tag, I have a conference call today, is that correct? - Yes, at 4.<br> - Okay, thank you, that'll be all.<br> Wait, wait.<br> Did you see that? He had no idea there was something going on between us.<br> - I'd better get back to my desk.<br> - Okay, hard worker.<br> I'll put that in your evaluation.<br> - My what? - You've been here for two months now.<br> And your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.<br> But you know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.<br> - Are you serious? - No, but I've always wanted to do that.<br> Can you help me clean this up? The basket is totally empty! The neighbors ate it all! Well, either that or .<br> Joey! Yeah? - Did you eat all the neighbor candy? - That was the plan.<br> When I got to it, there was only a few pieces left.<br> They've come by all day.<br> They love it.<br> They love my candy? - Oh, man, I gotta go make more.<br> - Hey, Mon.<br> Make some more lasagna too.<br> Something might have happened to a chunk of it.<br> Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.<br> Mine stole my newspaper.<br> It's like a crime wave.<br> Pheebs, you got a second? Sure.<br> Ever since you told me about that bike I couldn't stop thinking about it.<br> I mean, everyone should have a first bike, you know? So .<br> Oh, my God, Ross! - You like it? - I love it! - Yeah? - Oh, oh, God And I love you.<br> Not that way.<br> But the bike got you a lot closer.<br> Well, take it downstairs.<br> You know, give it a test drive.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, my God.<br> My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.<br> You're welcome.<br> Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.<br> Am not.<br> Who is that? Don't worry, I'm brave.<br> l I am brave.<br> No, no, no, no! Can you tell me who is there, please? My name's Gary.<br> I live upstairs.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - Do you know what time it is? - It's candy time.<br> My roommate says they taste like little drops of heaven.<br> Oh, please.<br> Did you hear that? "Little drops of heaven.<br> " Four a.<br>m.<br> So can I get some candy? I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work.<br> He does not know that I am not "some of us.<br> " I'm sorry, but I'll put some out in the morning.<br> Okay, I'll swing by later.<br> You live in this building? Seems like I'd remember you.<br> Night, Gar.<br> So did you read your evaluation yet? No, it was marked "confidential.<br> " I just sent it to human resources.<br> Please, you're kidding, right? I wrote that one as a joke for you.<br> A joke they would appreciate? I'm thinking, no.<br> - What did you say? - I said you were a good kisser and that I liked your teeny, tiny tushy.<br> No, not my tushy.<br> It gets worse.<br> About your initiative, I wrote: "He was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision.<br> " Under problems with performance, I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not.<br> " And then And then I drew a little smiley face.<br> And then a small pornographic sketch.<br> That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike.<br> When I heard the story, I almost cried.<br> Almost cried, huh? Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.<br> Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic.<br>  Those two had only each other.<br> She really likes it, huh? Oh, yeah.<br> I saw her walking it down the street.<br> She had these flowers in the basket.<br> It was so cute.<br> I saw her this morning, walking it by the park.<br> Wait, she was walking the bike? Both times? - Hey, Pheebs.<br> - Oh, hi! - Hey, so you enjoying the bike? - Oh, uh-huh, so much.<br> Pheebs, you do know how to ride a bike, don't you? Of course.<br> Can we see you ride it? Okay.<br> See? I told you not to get involved with your assistant.<br> There's no such thing as a secret when it comes to affairs.<br> Did you hear that, Chandler? No such thing.<br> What happened? I'm just eating candy.<br> Maybe it's not that bad.<br> They might not take it the way I meant it.<br> Absolutely, you know? Because "tushy" can mean both ass and good worker.<br> I just gotta get the thing back.<br> Rach? That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little like this? Oh, my God, Joey! - What is the matter with you? - God! This little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.<br> Hi, I'm sorry.<br> I know it's after hours, but I really need candy.<br> I'm sorry, I can't help you.<br> See? Rules are rules.<br> Please, I have people coming from out of town today.<br> - I told them all about your candy.<br> - You're kidding.<br> Out-of-towners, huh? What did you tell them? I told them your candy was absolutely indescribable.<br> Some people have said it's "little drops of heaven.<br> " But whatever.<br> - Please, can't you help me out? - Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady? Isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud? All right, I'll do it just this once.<br> - But you can't tell anyone.<br> - Please, just give it to me.<br> Yeah, that's her.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Unbelievable! I can't believe that sign didn't work.<br> You know what would work? Stop making candy.<br> But they like it.<br> You mean they like you.<br> Maybe.<br> Is that why you became a chef, so people would like you? You want to talk about getting people to like you, huh, funny man? Just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine.<br> Okay? Here we go.<br> Ready, set Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.<br> Maybe before we start we should just get another one.<br> Perhaps like an airplane seat, or a beanbag chair! You can't get out of this.<br> You have to learn how to ride a bike.<br> Why? Why do I have to learn? - Well, in case of an emergency.<br> - What kind of emergency? Well, what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says: "You ride this bike or I'll I'll shoot you.<br> " I would ring the bell to distract him.<br> Then I would knock the gun away with a Chinese throwing star.<br> Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike and, hey, I'll hold you up and push you.<br> Okay? You won't let go? - No.<br> - You swear? I swear.<br> - Okay.<br> - Come on.<br> Here we go.<br> All right? All right? Feel good? All right, try pedaling.<br> That's it, you're doing great.<br> Yes, take control.<br> Yes, yes, yes! Oh, no! You swore! - I just thought you were doing so well.<br> - I am shocked.<br> Shocked! It's a legitimate learning technique.<br> Wow.<br> Hey, there's some people outside asking about candy.<br> They'll just have to wait, okay? I only got two hands! - Need some help? - No, you don't know the system.<br> I don't need nobody messing with the system! By the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see a lot of me.<br> Oh, hello, liar.<br> Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.<br> I could've been killed, you know.<br> I know, I know.<br> But can we please try it again? I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.<br> Well, I would love to but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.<br> - Phoebe.<br> - What? What the hell? You know what? If you won't learn how to ride, then I'm sorry I have to take it back.<br> - But why? Because it's .<br> It'd be like you having this guitar and never playing it.<br> Okay, this guitar wants to be played.<br> And this bike wants to be ridden.<br> And if you don't ride it you're killing its spirit.<br> The bike is dying.<br> All right.<br> If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.<br> Great.<br> You're making the bike very happy.<br> Okay, Ross.<br> Please don't die! To get the evaluation before they see it we gotta get into Zelner's office.<br> He doesn't get in until 10.<br> But his assistant, Betty, comes in early to eat breakfast at her desk.<br> - That's kind of sad.<br> - Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.<br> Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.<br> While I distract her, you go in.<br> - Got it.<br> - Let's roll.<br> Hello, Rachel.<br> You got a minute? Yeah, sure, Mr.<br> Zelner.<br> For you? Anything.<br> Minute.<br> Okay, great.<br> Abort the plan.<br> Actually, I'd like to speak to both of you.<br> Okay.<br> Well, can we get you anything, Mr.<br> Zelner? Maybe some chocolates.<br> No, thanks, but I'll give these to Betty.<br> So, I read your evaluation of Tag.<br> Or, to use his full name, Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones? Is something going on with you two? Oh, my God, can you imagine if there was? I mean, what would happen exactly? Well, I'd be forced to file a report.<br> I'd have to consult with the legal department.<br> And your future at the company would be in jeopardy.<br> - Well - Mr.<br> Zelner .<br> I filled in that evaluation.<br> - Oh, no - Yeah, yeah.<br> I thought it would be funny.<br> You wrote that you have a cute tushy? Yes.<br> I have a weird sense of humor.<br> And I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.<br> It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.<br> What is this drawing? I can't figure it out.<br> It's upside down, you gotta It doesn't matter.<br> It's not like I don't have a sense of humor.<br> Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then.<br> There's a time and a place.<br> Unless you have a limerick right now.<br> No? Okay.<br> Well, you've got my fax number.<br> I can't believe you did that.<br> That was sweet.<br> - Don't worry about it.<br> - You could've lost your job.<br> Are you kidding me? With this cute butt, I'd find work.<br> Thank you, you're great.<br> - You know what? - What? I feel great.<br> In fact .<br> What? It's just It took me so long to get that desk organized.<br> I'm sorry.<br> There it is.<br> What is going on? We're waiting for the candy.<br> Bring out the candy! Yeah, lady, give us candy.<br> Joey! - What's up, buddy? - What are you doing? Waiting to get candy.<br> Get in here.<br> Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.<br> Merry Christmas.<br> The candy is coming! I need another 15 minutes for it to cool.<br> All right, everybody, just be quiet.<br> Be quiet! Be quiet! Pipe down! What is the matter with you people? This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you.<br> She was making candy so she could get to know all of you and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name.<br> Am I right? Candy Lady? No, not "Candy Lady.<br> " If we know it, can we have candy? All right, you know what? Forget it, you've ruined it.<br> Go home.<br> You've ruined it.<br> That's all wrong! You guys ruined everything.<br> You ruined it! - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> Did you smoke? No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.<br> Are you okay? Fine, but it was really scary for a while.<br> Someone slipped a threatening note under the door! Oh, yeah.<br> Sorry about that.<br> Mob mentality or whatever.<br> I can't believe it.<br> I did it.<br> I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, hey, don't thank me.<br> Thank yourself.<br> You're the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them.<br> Don't be so corny, Ross.<br> It's not an After School Special.<br>   <br>
