Hey, who is that guy? I think I know him.<br> No, you don't.<br> Oh, my God! Monica, he's the stripper from your bachelorette party! Her what? Your secret bachelorette party.<br> - Bachelorette party? - She untied his G-string with her teeth.<br> Somebody stop me! We weren't gonna have parties.<br> We agreed that it's a silly tradition.<br> It's a grand tradition! They surprised me.<br> There was nothing I could do.<br> You could've untied it with your hands.<br> This is so unfair.<br> I wanted to throw a bachelor party but I wasn't allowed.<br> All we got was dinner.<br> You went home with the waitress.<br> Yeah, that was a good night.<br> Why didn't you tell me? The two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty.<br> I knew giving you that book would come back and bite me in the ass.<br> The One With the Stripper mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 - I'll order everyone the chicken.<br> - Oh, I don't eat meat.<br> It's chicken! - I don't eat that either.<br> - I never understand you lesbians.<br> - So, what's new with you? - Well, actually Your '74 Lafite, sir.<br> I ordered the '75.<br> That's a magnificent wine.<br> '74 is sewage!

So he can get mad at the baby? - That's the baby's problem.<br> - Everything okay with the waiter? - I don't know.<br> I went to the bathroom.<br> So, sweetie, you were starting to tell me what's new with you.<br> I got TiVo.<br> - What's TiVo? - It's slang for "pregnant.<br>" Are you pregnant? Well, yes and no.<br> Except, not no.<br> So to sum it up, yeah.<br> Who is the father? Please don't tell me it's her! No, it's Ross.<br> You like Ross.<br> I hope you're okay with this.<br> This is a good thing.<br> This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy! That's true.<br> I'm a poppy!

Thanks for showing me your semiprecious stone collection.<br> It was amazing.<br> My God, you must be good in bed.<br> So you and Mona.<br> It's been a while.<br> How is it? It's going good.<br> I mean, we get along great.<br> She's so - Hot? - I was gonna say sweet, but yeah! She's okay with the baby? I haven't actually told her yet.<br> I don't wanna scare her off.<br> You have to be honest, or you may think you're on the same path but you're on different ones.<br> I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.<br> You are gonna love me so much.<br> I felt bad about the bachelorette party so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.<br> I got this number from a guy at work and I hired a stripper for you.<br> I'm going in the wife hall of fame! - Honey, I don't want a stripper.<br> - Will you let the lady talk? Come on, it'll be fun.<br> It'll make me feel better.<br> I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy.<br> I'm not a bachelor anymore.<br> Just think of it as a two-month anniversary present.<br> Sure.<br> One year is paper, but two months is lap dance.<br> Please, I feel so bad.<br> Just watch the hot woman get naked! - Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.<br> - Yeah! And Joey.<br> - Who else do you wanna invite? - Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.<br> I can't make it.<br> I'm seeing Mona tonight.<br> Why cancel a real date to go to a fake bachelor party? I'm sorry.<br> I gotta cancel tonight, baby.<br> I'm sorry I won't make it to your imaginary wedding.<br> I'm busy that day.<br> I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.<br> I know.<br> I panicked.<br> I didn't want him yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.<br> It's Lafite.<br> The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.<br> I'm gonna tell him.<br> I'm gonna be strong.<br> I just called a friend.<br> I think I may be able to book the Plaza on short notice.<br> Really? The Plaza? Oh, Daddy! - Daddy, I need to talk to you.<br> - What is it, sweetie? Ross and I aren't getting married.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - I don't believe this! - Stay calm, please.<br> - How do you expect me to stay calm? This is unacceptable, Rachel.<br> And I wanna know why! Is it because that punk won't marry you? - Is that it? - Yes.<br> He says I'm damaged goods.<br> You nervous about getting married? What are you doing? Pretend it's a real bachelor party.<br> It'll be more fun.<br> All right.<br> I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.<br> You're never gonna be with another woman.<br> You have to wake up to the same face every day until you finally have the sweet release of death.<br> You're right.<br> This is more fun.<br> That's her! Okay, come on! Which one of you is Chandler? That's me! That's me.<br> Joey Tribbiani.<br> Big fan.<br> - Is that a bedroom? - Yeah, right over there.<br> Whenever you're ready.<br> That was weird.<br> - Why would she go in the bedroom? - I'm waiting.<br> - So she's a - Yeah, that's one naked hooker.<br> I love your place.<br> Where is this guy from? That's an 18th-century artifact from Calcutta.<br> Oh.<br> Wow.<br> So you're more than just dinosaurs.<br> So much more.<br> Oh, my God! I am so sorry! Forget it.<br> It's from Pier 1.<br> Sorry.<br> Think you can knock up my daughter and not marry her? I ought to kill you! This is actually not a great time for me.<br> So come on.<br> Explain yourself, Geller.<br> - You got Rachel pregnant! - You got her pregnant? - Who did? - You did! Yes, but it was a one-night thing.<br> It meant nothing.<br> Oh? Really? My daughter means nothing? No, sir.<br> She means a lot to me.<br> I love Rachel.<br> - What? - But not that way.<br> I'm not in love.<br> I love her like a friend.<br> So you get her in trouble and refuse to marry her? I offered to marry her.<br> But I didn't want to.<br> Why not? You wanted to be with this tramp? Tramp? I'm sorry.<br> Dr.<br> Green, Mona.<br> Mona, Dr.<br> Green.<br> I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper but she got confused about what to do.<br> Maybe.<br> Technically, she stripped.<br> We just missed it.<br> Ma'am? Are you also a stripper? No, but I can pretend to strip.<br> Costs extra.<br> Here's the extras: Handcuffs, spanking Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.<br> Getting her husband a hooker.<br> That's pretty funny.<br> That is funny.<br> Maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.<br> I'll bet Ross was in on it.<br> He was conveniently busy.<br> - You mind if I smoke in here? - Actually, I'd rather Go ahead.<br> We're gonna have to burn that room, anyway.<br> - How could you hide this? - I wanted to tell you, but You'd get what you wanted, then dump her, like Rachel.<br> Hey, I did not dump Rachel.<br> Nor are we still together.<br> Can l? We'll just let the machine get that.<br> "Ross", "it's Joey.<br>" There's a hooker here.<br> We thought you'd know something about it.<br> No! No! No! No! I need to lie down.<br> Tonight's the bachelor party? - Thanks for that number.<br> - No problem.<br> Who's the party for? - My husband.<br> - You hired your husband a hooker? - She's a stripper.<br> - No, a hooker.<br> - Is that a name for strippers? - Lf they're hookers.<br> Stu, I can't believe you did this.<br> You're sure she's a hooker? Either that, or she's the best, most expensive date I ever had.<br> - Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.<br> - Why would she do that? Maybe she wants you to learn something.<br> Is there anything you're really bad at, sexually? This is the worst bachelor party ever.<br> - What's taking you boys so long? - In a minute! What's gonna happen in a minute? You should ask her to leave.<br> - Why me? - It's your party.<br> - Which is why you should do it.<br> - No, you do it.<br> Rock, paper, scissors for who tells the whore to leave.<br> - What? - I miss this.<br> I don't think we've done this before.<br> No, I miss hanging out with you.<br> - We still hang out.<br> - Not like we used to.<br> Remember? We used to be inseparable.<br> You know, now it's like things are different.<br> Well, you know, things are different.<br> I'm married now.<br> Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for you guys.<br> I just miss hanging out.<br> Just us, you know? Yeah, I miss that too.<br> From now on, we'll make time to hang out.<br> You got it.<br> Come here.<br> Oh, God.<br> Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.<br> She's a hooker! She's a Hi.<br> We spoke on the phone.<br> So your dad dropped by.<br> He's a pleasant man.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - I better go.<br> Just over here.<br> I can't miss the fight.<br> Ross, I am so sorry.<br> I'll straighten this out tomorrow in person.<br> Or via e-mail.<br> I don't care about your dad.<br> Mona is totally freaked out! I'll fix that too.<br> What's her e-mail? I'll fix this.<br> I swear I'll talk to her.<br> Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> That's it? You call that a fight? "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two? Thank you so much for coming back over.<br> Oh, good.<br> You're here.<br> And I was worried that it would be uncomfortable.<br> Mona, just hear me out.<br> I'm sorry about my father yelling at you.<br> But you held your own.<br> You have to tell me how.<br> - Focus.<br> - Okay.<br> Yes, Ross and I used to date.<br> And yes, we are gonna have a baby.<br> But we are definitely not getting back together.<br> - How can I be sure? - We drove each other crazy.<br> He was possessive, jealous.<br> He couldn't let the little things go.<br> Trying to date this woman.<br> None of that compared to how kind and gentle and thoughtful he is.<br> You probably shouldn't touch me.<br> I don't want something so complicated.<br> But what relationship is not complicated? We all have our baggage.<br> You must too.<br> Why else would you still be single? I'm so gonna leave right now.<br> Should I leave this open? I'm not sure.<br> Why didn't you just tell me? It has nothing to do with how I feel.<br> - You still should have told me.<br> - I was going to but I thought you should hear it from Rachel's father.<br> I made a mistake but it's only because I really like you.<br> Really.<br> Okay.<br> I guess you can close the door now.<br> Forgot my purse.<br> Oh, you guys made up.<br> Good kisser, isn't he? I'm going! I swear I didn't know she was a hooker.<br> You let her smoke? Her ass-print is still on our quilt.<br> Really want to talk about smoking? I'm gonna make this up to you.<br> I promised a stripper and you're gonna get a stripper.<br> - Monica, wait.<br> - What? Carry on.<br> These tennis shoes are so tight.<br> - I think I'll take them off.<br> - Could you not narrate? Gotcha, sailor.<br> Just because you're not in love - You told your dad the truth.<br> - An hour ago.<br> - Wanna go see a movie? - Yes.<br> Bye, Dad.<br> It's unacceptable! What does love have to do with it? There are more important things than love.<br> You have to think about the consequences of your decisions! I do think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to? Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.<br>   <br>
