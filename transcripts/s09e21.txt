                    			It's so weird.<br> How did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? - I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.<br> - I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too.<br> But surprise! I missed most of the party.<br> Charlie's a girl, right? Yeah, she's this new professor in my department that I did not kiss.<br> I don't know why Joey had to kiss her.<br> Of all the girls at the party, God! - Why do you care so much? - Yes, Rachel.<br> Why do you care so much? Because Ross is the father of my child.<br> You know, and I want him to hook up with lots of women.<br> All I'm saying is, I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.<br> I don't know.<br> They seemed to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils.<br> Wow.<br> Joey and a professor.<br> Can you imagine if they had kids? And if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism those nerds would get laid! All right.<br> So, Ross, you're okay with all this? I mean It's no big deal.<br> I just met her.<br> I'm fine with it.<br> God, I forgot how hot she was.<br> I'm gonna get some more coffee.<br> - Oh, you know, I'll come with you.<br> - Okay.<br> - So a professor, huh? - Yeah.<br> She is cool.<br> And she's so smart.<br> Her mind is totally acrimonious.<br> Guess that's not how she used it.<br> I feel like I owe you an explanation.<br> I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties.<br> I'm Well, I'm kind of embarrassed.<br> I really hope you don't think less of me.<br> Think less of you? No.<br> I don't think less of you.<br> I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them.<br> Those people who like someone and don't kiss them those people are stupid.<br> I hate those people.<br> Actually, I'm a little surprised at myself.<br> I mean, Joey's so different from the guys I usually date.<br> They're all professors, intellectuals.<br> Paleontologists mostly.<br> - You know, very cerebral - Yeah, I know the type.<br> If we want to grab a bite before work, we'd better get acrimonious.<br> No? Am I getting close? The One With The Fertility Test mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 - Hey! - Hi.<br> Hey, you guys.<br> Look what I just got.<br> Oh, wow! I love those! Where did you get them? I bought them off eBay.<br> They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.<br> Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.<br> Oh, then I overpaid.<br> Hey, what's this? Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in SoHo.<br> You can't show Phoebe this.<br> She hates those corporate massage chains.<br> What, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of.<br> I can't eat veal.<br> I can't wear fur.<br> I can't go hunting.<br> - Do you want to go hunting? - I would like to have the option.<br> What's that? Hey, Rachel? No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these big massage places.<br> They're putting people like me out of business.<br> She wants to go hunting too! Phoebe, come on, I don't want to waste it.<br> It would be like throwing away 100 bucks.<br> Okay, this is not about the money.<br> Okay? It's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us hollow shells.<br> I don't care about any of that.<br> Well, do you care about friendship? I feel really strongly about this.<br> Please don't use this gift certificate.<br> I'm asking you as a friend.<br> Oh, not as a friend.<br> Phoebe! Fine.<br> I won't use it.<br> - Promise? - I promise.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Well, I am going hunting.<br> Hey, honey.<br> I missed you today.<br> - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.<br> Hey.<br> - What do you wanna do tonight? - Oh, well, maybe we could Okay, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience.<br> Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests.<br> Until then, you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.<br> Do we really need to take those tests? We've been trying to have a baby for a year.<br> I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's okay.<br> - Just a few routine tests.<br> - But I don't want to do it in a cup.<br> - What is the big deal? - It's weird! You're in a doctor's office.<br> It's not okay to do it in a doctor's office but it is okay to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell? I cannot believe Ross told you that.<br> And in my defense, it was a Wendy's.<br> Look, I don't want to do these tests either.<br> But I really do think it's a good idea.<br> I'm sure a doctor's office can't be worse than on a class trip to the Hershey factory.<br> Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too! Who says wine has to cost more than milk? - Hey! - Hi.<br> - Come on in.<br> How are you? - I'm good.<br> - Can I offer you a drink? - Please.<br> I have been crazed all day.<br> I had a meeting with the dean, my syllabus for summer school's due and I'm writing the foreword for a book.<br> I had a pretty hectic day at work too.<br> Today I had to open a door and go: So I am just so excited to be here.<br> - I can't wait to explore the city.<br> - Lf you need a tour guide Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun.<br> Oh, yeah, definitely.<br> Definitely.<br> Okay.<br> What do you want to see first? We could go see the Kronos Quartet at Avery Fisher Hall.<br> Okay.<br> There's a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.<br> I know.<br> - But first, I have to see the Met.<br> - Okay, let me stop you right there.<br> The Mets suck, okay? You wanna see the Yankees.<br> No.<br> No, not the Mets.<br> The Met.<br> Singular.<br> Which one? They all suck.<br> The museum.<br> I don't think so.<br> - Hi there.<br> - Hello.<br> Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.<br> How may I help you? Hi.<br> I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green.<br> - Okay.<br> - And here is my gift certificate.<br> - This has been torn up.<br> - And taped back together.<br> Okay.<br> Well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.<br> - Okay.<br> - Have a seat through the glass doors.<br> - Through the glass doors.<br> - Through the glass doors.<br> Alrighty then.<br> Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.<br> Do we have to talk like that when they're not around? Oh, no.<br> No, no.<br> Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me? - Sorry.<br> Everyone is booked.<br> - That woman can't know I work here.<br> She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful these massage chains are.<br> - Then why do you work here? - Because it's good money.<br> But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil, bloodsucking corporate machine.<br> Well, I think this is a great place to work.<br> Okay, are they listening? - Ross.<br> Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> I need to talk to you about Charlie.<br> Oh, do you? Do you really? Yeah, I'm kind of having a little problem.<br> Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it.<br> Look, you know Charlie, right? - She's cool, funny, her body is so - Get to the problem.<br> Right.<br> She's just so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated.<br> Combined.<br> You know? And I just I don't want her to think I'm stupid.<br> Are you wearing two belts? Hey, what do you know? You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.<br> Well, she wants to go to all these cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff.<br> You gotta help me out.<br> I don't want to get involved in your guys' relationship.<br> Oh, dude, please.<br> Come on, you're the smartest person I know.<br> And I really like this girl, okay? I don't want to lose her.<br> - Fine.<br> - Thanks.<br> Okay.<br> Let's see.<br> - Oh, you should take her to the Met.<br> - The Mets.<br> No, no, no.<br> The Met.<br> The Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br> Oh, that's what she meant.<br> If they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the "Muse," you know? Short for "museum" and avoid all the confusion.<br> Yeah, most days the place is packed with confused, angry baseball fans.<br> Okay.<br> All right, so I'll take her to the Met.<br> Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> There's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue.<br> You know what? She loves architecture.<br> You should take a walk down Fifth to the St.<br> Patrick's Cathedral.<br> And there, there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.<br> Jeez.<br> Sounds like you should be going on this date.<br> But I'm not.<br> - And you know what? - Okay, slow down.<br> You're going way too fast.<br> Okay? Just go back to the Met.<br> So you gotta tell me exactly what to do there.<br> When you walk into the museum, take a right, okay? That's the antiquities wing.<br> Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.<br> Okay.<br> So I walk in the door and make a right.<br> I have a weird feeling about this place.<br> How do I know they won't secretly videotape me and put it all over the Internet? Because, honey, and I mean this in the sweetest way possible nobody's gonna wanna watch that.<br> Mr.<br> Bing? Here you are.<br> Go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.<br> Deposit my specimen? I usually have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk.<br> Thanks.<br> Got it.<br> All right.<br> Honey, my tests are down the hall.<br> - Are you sure you're gonna be okay? - Yeah, I guess.<br> Look, I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares.<br> No one here even knows you.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, come on! How great is this? We're probably fertile.<br> Let's go home.<br> Why are you here? Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time No, no, no.<br> I mean, why? Why is she here? Oh, someone's a little cranky today because they have to do it in a cup.<br> Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.<br> What? This was fun.<br> But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to.<br> I'd love to stay but I've got a hot date.<br> Please go.<br> Just let me know if you need a hand.<br> I think it just fell off.<br> Hello, "ja".<br> It's time for your massage, "ja"? Put your face in the hole.<br> A Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.<br> Okay, then I'm Swedish.<br> So, what's your name? It's a normal Swedish name.<br> Ikea.<br> - Wow.<br> What an interesting name.<br> - Yeah.<br> - You know, l - Time for your scalp massage.<br> Wow.<br> I really love your - Is something wrong? - No, it's just It just feels so good Ikea.<br> Hey, say, you'll know this.<br> What's the capital of Sweden? Stockholm.<br> Damn.<br> I wish I knew if that was right.<br> Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas.<br> Monet painted quickly, and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.<br> Now, do you have any idea what you just said? No, no.<br> My mouth says the words, my brain is thinking "monster trucks.<br>" Now, remember, when you get to the museum Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y.<br> I just - I wrote that out phonetically for you.<br> - Phonetically? Yeah, that means We just don't have time for this.<br> I gotta say, I'm really impressed you were able to memorize all this so quickly.<br> I'm an actor.<br> I can memorize anything.<br> Last week on "Days", I had to say: "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy.<br>" - Wow.<br> What does that mean? - No idea.<br> But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means, "You'll get eaten by a bear.<br>" Okay.<br> - So let's move on to the Renaissance.<br> - Okay.<br> Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure.<br> Touch it.<br> It's really bumpy.<br> No, no, no.<br> No ad-libbing.<br> And, dude, you can't touch the paintings.<br> - Come on.<br> - No.<br> No! My specimen's in the room.<br> I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there.<br> Really helped speed the process along.<br> Janice, you're not gone? Sid is still in his room.<br> I don't allow porn at home, so this is like a vacation for him.<br> So did you do it? Did you make your deposit? - Yeah.<br> The hard part's over.<br> - That's not the hard part, honey.<br> The hard part's what comes next.<br> Aren't you worried about the results? I haven't even thought about the results.<br> I just assumed everything would be okay.<br> Well, you know what? It probably is.<br> But what if it's not okay? I mean, what if there's a reason we can't have a baby? Chandler.<br> Look, you and Monica are meant to have children.<br> I'm sure it's gonna be just fine.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> Thanks.<br> I can't believe I didn't even think of that.<br> I guess I was so worried about having to come here and do that.<br> You can do it in a Taco Bell parking lot but you can't do it at a doctor's office? It was a Wendy's! And that's the Swedish national anthem.<br> Thank you for asking.<br> Wow, lkea.<br> What a rich culture.<br> You know what? I have a friend who's a masseuse.<br> - Oh? "Ja", "ja"? - "Ja".<br> She's not very good, though.<br> - And why do you think that is? - I don't know.<br> Maybe it's because she's got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar.<br> Or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high-maintenance tight-ass.<br> - Phoebe! - You know it's me? Well, for like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden! How can you come here? - Why didn't you tell me you work here? - I don't have to tell you everything! You do if you're gonna make me feel guilty for getting a free massage.<br> Tip's not included.<br> Why did you lie to me about working here? Because I was ashamed, okay? I sold out for the cash.<br> And they give me benefits, like medical and dental and a four-oh-wunk.<br> But, you know, you pay a price.<br> Now I'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and paying taxes! Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much you should walk out there right now and quit.<br> Be true to what you believe in.<br> Honey, you have principles, and I so admire that.<br> I don't have any.<br> You know what? You're right.<br> I am gonna quit.<br> - It's time I took my life back.<br> - Good for you, Pheebs.<br> If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that.<br> I love you.<br> Got you! Die! Die! Die! Respectfully, Professor R.<br> Geller.<br> Hey, how was the Met? The museum was amazing.<br> Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh? Not so much, no.<br> He had clearly memorized all this stuff to say and some of it didn't even make any sense.<br> - What do you mean? - Well, for one he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.<br> Wait a minute.<br> When you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right? - No.<br> No, we went to the left.<br> - Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.<br> Still, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, it's fun.<br> What? Actually, Joey's your friend and you don't know me that well.<br> It'd be weird.<br> Well, I mean, a little.<br> But no, what? Go on.<br> Well I'm thinking that maybe Joey isn't the right guy for me right now.<br> You know, maybe I should be with someone I have more in common with.<br> You know what I mean? Yeah.<br> Yeah, but you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance.<br> I mean, he's a great guy.<br> And sure, he doesn't know that much about art but you can always talk about that with someone else.<br> - I guess that's true.<br> - Lf you think about it he memorized all that stuff because he thought it was important to you.<br> You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.<br> He is very sweet.<br> Plus, he is hot! That was gonna be my next argument.<br> - You ready? - Yeah.<br> Let's go.<br> Wow! - Thanks, Ross.<br> - Yeah.<br> Hey, Ross.<br> That art stuff worked.<br> You hooked me up.<br> Glad I could help, man.<br> Some of the stuff wasn't where you said it would be, but I made it work.<br> It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.<br> Hello? Oh.<br> Hi, Dr.<br> Connelly.<br> No.<br> Well, she's not here but I can tell her.<br> Should I be sitting down for this? Well, so, what does that mean? Okay.<br> Okay, thank you.<br> Thanks.<br> Hey, sweetie.<br> Dr.<br> Connelly just called.<br> With good news? Of course it's not good news.<br> You said, "Dr.<br> Connelly just called.<br>" If it was good, you'd have said, "Dr.<br> Connelly just called!" So, what is it? Is it? Is there a problem? Is there a problem with me, or with you? Actually, it's both of us.<br> What? Apparently, my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.<br> Well, what does that mean? It means that my guys won't get off their Barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.<br> - It means - Wait, Chandler.<br> It means that we can keep trying but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry too.<br> Well we're gonna figure this out.<br> I know.<br> - Good morning, Phoebe.<br> - Good morning, receptionist.<br> Here's your schedule for the day.<br> Your first client is in Room 1.<br> "Rachel Green.<br>" Son of a bitch! She came back? Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassie!   <br>
