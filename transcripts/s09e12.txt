Okay.<br> I don't want to freak you out or anything but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> No, that's Bob.<br> Well, he's your pet rat? Well, not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for.<br> Kind of like Santa.<br> Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.<br> You can't keep a rat in your apartment.<br> They're unsanitary.<br> I mean, they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.<br> - What are those? - I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments.<br> - You have to get rid of it.<br> - Okay, fine.<br> If it means that much to you, I'll get rid of Bob.<br> Thank you.<br> It's so weird you think he's so gross, yet you're willing to eat his crackers.<br> - Hello.<br> - Hello.<br> Gavin, I just want to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation.<br> I really owe you an apology.<br> - For what? - When we first met, you know I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious.<br> Is this your first apology? No, I just mean, you know, first impressions don't mean anything.<br> And I think you're a really good guy.<br> And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.<br> - Morning.<br> - Hello.<br> But you know what? Hey, new day, new leaf.<br> I am just really, really happy I'm sorry.<br> Obviously, Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait till it's finished.<br> - What? - I was giving you an apology and you were totally checking her out.<br> I wasn't.<br> I'm in fashion.<br> I was looking at her skirt.<br> Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.<br> Wow, you are really You're really a creep.<br> What do you care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous? Oh, yeah.<br> I'm jealous.<br> "Oh, Gavin.<br> Please, please look at my ass.<br>" Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate.<br> Okay? This is a work environment.<br> She's your subordinate.<br> But it was okay when you slept with your old assistant, Tag? That is totally different for two reasons.<br> One: I didn't know that you knew that.<br> And two: I wasn't some creep staring at his ass.<br> We had a We had a deep, meaningful relationship.<br> What was Tag's last name? It was Oh, my God.<br> He didn't He didn't He didn't have a last name.<br> It was just Tag, you know, like Cher or you know, Moses.<br> But it was a deep, meaningful relationship.<br> You know what? My first impression of you was absolutely right.<br> You are arrogant.<br> You are pompous.<br> Morgan! Morgan! - Tag's last name was Morgan! - It was Jones.<br> What are you, his boyfriend? - Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.<br> - You mean when you were a baby? Sure.<br> Would you stop staring at her? I wasn't staring.<br> I was leering.<br> What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.<br> Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.<br> You know, when it's right there in your face.<br> Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive.<br> Makes me feel like I earned it.<br> Looks like Joey's doing all right with her.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.<br> - I'm gonna take her to the apartment.<br> - Okay.<br> I'll be home right after work.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay, bye, Emma.<br> I love you.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk.<br> It's not so good.<br> I think it's sweet.<br> Bye, Emma! Hey, listen, Joey.<br> About Molly, I would really prefer if you didn't go after her.<br> - Why not? - It took months to find a good nanny.<br> And I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.<br> So you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again, and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, that sounds about right.<br> Come on, there are plenty of other women out there.<br> Just forget about her, okay? She's off-limits.<br> Oh, man! What'd you have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have her, makes me want her even more! - What are you, a child? - Yes! Look, Joey, come on now.<br> For me, please.<br> Just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.<br> Fine.<br> Take me home.<br> - Hey, Mikey.<br> - Hey, Pheeb.<br> - What are you doing? - Setting rattraps.<br> - To kill Bob? - No.<br> No, to test his neck strength.<br> No, I don't want to kill him.<br> I thought we were gonna capture him and, you know, set him free in the countryside where he could meet a friendly possum and a wisecracking owl.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> I'll throw away the traps.<br> - All right, I'll find Bob.<br> I'll get him.<br> Bob? Bob? Robert? Wait, I think I hear him.<br> Oh, my God! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom! We'll have to think of a new name.<br> I don't know, I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.<br> No, no.<br> I mean, I'm not sure that we Oh, my God.<br> We killed Bob? Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.<br> Maybe it was a mouse.<br> Susie? What's up? Seriously, dude.<br> Three years ago.<br> Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today.<br> Can you keep an eye on Joey make sure nothing happens between him and Molly? - You don't trust him? - Well, no.<br> Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny.<br>" Is this your long-term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.<br> You do appear right on the cusp of something.<br> Look, come on, man.<br> I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two but for now, could you please just do this for me? Fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work.<br> Because you know once Joey sets his mind on something more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.<br> Well, I mean, we've gotta do something.<br> Okay? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.<br> - Picturing that tree? - I am, yes.<br> Where you going, Joe? For a walk.<br> You mind if I join you? Actually, I'd rather be alone.<br> You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.<br> Your thoughts? Plural? All right, fine.<br> I only have one thought.<br> It's about the hot nanny! I gotta see her! - I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.<br> - Now you're saying I can't see her? You're killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like, like like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy.<br> Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there? Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.<br> So I can't let you go.<br> Interesting.<br> Now there are obstacles.<br> Hot nanny and me against the world! This is the stuff great novels are made of.<br> - Great novels? - Fine.<br> Mediocre porn.<br> - Gavin Mitchell's office.<br> - Rachel Greene's office.<br> Give me that phone.<br> Hello, this is Rachel Greene.<br> How can I help you? Okay then.<br> I'll pass you back to your son.<br> Hey, Mom.<br> No, that's just my secretary.<br> Excuse me, Gavin.<br> I have a question I need to ask you.<br> Mom, I'll call you later.<br> Yeah.<br> - Yes? - Lf you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look in a mirror? Thank God you finally said that.<br> I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.<br> - Man, I really bug you.<br> Don't I? - Oh, no.<br> Please I don't care about you enough to bug me.<br> In fact, from now on, I'm going to take the high road and I'm going to be very, very nice to you, you mama's boy starting right now.<br> - Hey, Rach.<br> - Hi.<br> - Ready for your birthday lunch? - I am.<br> But first, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleague and more importantly my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.<br> - Pleased to meet you.<br> - Pleased to meet you.<br> Are you coming to Rachel's party? Oh, no, no, no, no.<br> Gavin can't.<br> He already has plans most likely with his mother.<br> I don't mind.<br> I'll cancel them.<br> I would never miss my secretary's birthday.<br> Why did you invite him? I can't stand that guy! - You were being so nice to him.<br> - I was faking it.<br> Can't you tell when I'm being fake? Hey, Mr.<br> Phillips.<br> Nice suit.<br> Right there.<br> That was so fake! I still can't believe you invited Gavin.<br> He is just the last person I want to see.<br> You're welcome for the party.<br> I'm glad you're having a good time.<br> I hope he doesn't show up.<br> Of course he won't, the guy hates me.<br> - Does he? - What? Maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he likes you.<br> It's like in first grade when Skippy Lange would push me because he secretly had a crush on me.<br> Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those boys had a bet to see if he could knock you over.<br> - She's out.<br> I'm gonna take her home.<br> - Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> Bye, sweetheart.<br> Do you see what all the guys see in her? Wouldn't kick her out of bed.<br> No more vodka for me.<br> Hey, Rach.<br> So can I sing "Happy Birthday" to you now? - Yeah, sure.<br> - All right.<br> See you later.<br> Hey, Rach.<br> Somebody got you shoes.<br> Give me! - Wow.<br> Wow.<br> Oh, my God! - Careful! Careful! These are my rat babies! Yeah.<br> We have rat babies now.<br> You brought rats to my birthday party? So this is what a stroke feels like.<br> Well, I had to bring them.<br> We killed their mother.<br> They're our responsibility now.<br> You know, they require constant care.<br> You should know that, you're a mother.<br> Are you comparing my daughter to a rat? No.<br> Seven rats.<br> We should take them home.<br> We need to feed them.<br> You're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats? Well, I'm sorry, Rachel, but I'm not like you.<br> Okay? Not everyone can afford help.<br> Hey, where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I got a little preoccupied.<br> Look, we have to stop them before something happens.<br> Right behind you, big guy.<br> So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline.<br> It takes a lot of hard work.<br> - So where'd you study? - I didn't go to college.<br> - No, where'd you study acting? - Molly, people don't study acting.<br> Molly, do you mind giving us just a minute? - Sure.<br> I'll go check on Emma.<br> - Thanks.<br> Will the stable boy never get the princess? What do you think you were gonna do, have sex with her here on my couch? No.<br> The leather sticks to my ass.<br> This isn't fair.<br> What makes you think I'm gonna sleep with her and then blow her off, huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actually like her and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel.<br> Okay? I didn't think I could ever love again.<br> - Come on! - Joe! Hi.<br> Is Molly here? Yeah, yeah.<br> Come on in.<br> Molly? - Hey.<br> Guys, this is Tabitha.<br> - Hey.<br> - I'll see you tomorrow.<br> - Okay.<br> Well, Joey, I guess we have no problem.<br> It's like my favorite fairy tale come true.<br> The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, you start preparing the formula and I'll start changing the box.<br> And then we gotta put them straight to bed.<br> When did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats? Well, you know what? They're our responsibility now.<br> Okay, fine.<br> These rats are our responsibility.<br> What happens when they mate and there are hundreds? Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.<br> Yeah, not such a problem with rats.<br> No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animal.<br> No.<br> Really? Oh, my Get off your sister! Oh, my God.<br> What are we gonna do? The We have seven rats.<br> So, what if each of them has seven rats and then each of those has seven rats? That's like That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do? Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy but we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> I guess you're right.<br> All right, so we should just give them away.<br> But to nice families with children and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.<br> Those were Bob's favorites.<br> It's gonna be okay.<br> - You must think I'm crazy.<br> - No, I think you're sweet.<br> Good.<br> This is just so hard.<br> It's hard for me to let them go.<br> I guess it just brings back memories, you know from when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up.<br> I haven't told you about that yet, have I? Thanks for the party, honey.<br> Should I help you clean up? No way.<br> You had your party.<br> Now I have mine.<br> - Is everything all right? - I just get bummed when my birthday's over.<br> Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about.<br> That jerk, Gavin, from your office didn't show up.<br> Yeah, I hate him.<br> We weren't talking about you.<br> We were No.<br> No way to recover.<br> No.<br> Okay.<br> - Fun party.<br> - Well, it was.<br> And you would have seen it if you didn't show up at Again, you're welcome! - Look, I'll just give you this and go.<br> - You bought me a present.<br> Why? Let me explain how birthday parties usually work.<br> There are presents and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person.<br> Okay, I I got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you.<br> Well, okay.<br> Well, that's very nice.<br> And you wrote a card.<br> - "From Gavin.<br>" - I really mean it.<br> It's beautiful.<br> If you don't mind? Let me.<br> Well, what do you know, it fits.<br> See, Gavin.<br> You're capable of being a nice guy.<br> Why do you give me such a hard time? I'm not sure.<br> Well, Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.<br> I do have feelings for you.<br> - You do? - Yes.<br> I feel that you're a little annoying.<br> See, why? Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you And you do that.<br> Hey.<br> Listen, I think I left something here.<br> Well, somebody left this.<br> Is this yours? No, but I like it.<br> No, I think I left one of my rat babies.<br> Well, no.<br> I haven't seen it, but if I do, I'll let you know.<br> Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby! Maybe that's him.<br>   <br>
