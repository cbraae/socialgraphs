                    			I just saw Kathy naked.<br> It was like torture.<br> If we go to war and you're captured, you're in for a surprise.<br> It keeps getting worse.<br> It bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend.<br> Every time we're in the same room, there's weird energy between us.<br> Call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.<br> And now I have seen her naked.<br> At least with her clothes on I could imagine her body was covered in boils.<br> But there are no boils.<br> She's smooth.<br> Smooth! -Could everyone see up his robe? -Oh, my God! The One Where Chandler Crosses the Line -Here you go.<br> -I'll call you.<br> Great! Hey, hey.<br> Who was that? Casey.<br> We're going out tonight.<br> Going out? Wow! It didn't work out with Kathy? Bummer.<br> No, things are fine.<br> I'm having a late meal with her after an early one with Casey.<br> -What? -Yeah.<br> The craziest thing is, I just ate a whole pizza myself.<br> You're going out with Kathy! Yeah.<br> Why are you upset? Well, I'm upset for you.<br> Sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be unfulfilling.<br> What's the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.<br> Look, Joey.<br> Kathy's clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.<br> But, Casey.<br> Granted, I just saw the back of her head.<br> But I got this sense that she's smart and funny and gets you.<br> You got all that from the back of her head? I think it's time for you to settle down.<br> Make a choice.<br> Pick a lane.<br> Who's Elaine? Little Tony Tarzan Swinging on a nose hair Swinging with the greatest of ease I don't know the next verse.<br> You could just go: Greatest of ease Then go right into it.<br> I like that.<br> How do you know about? You know, I used to play.<br> That's right.<br> The keyboards? A little in high school.<br> I got into it in college.<br> That's when I really found my sound.<br> Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was worth it.<br> Oh, my God! I completely forgot about your sound.<br> He'd lock himself in the basement for hours.<br> No one was ever allowed to hear the sound.<br> I want to hear the sound.<br> No, I mean, I haven't played in so long.<br> Well, it's really personal stuff.<br> Play that funky music, white boy.<br> -Yeah, come on.<br> -No, you guys.<br> My keyboards are all the way Yeah, okay.<br> Who wants to get dinner later? I wanna try that new ltalian restaurant.<br> Supposed to be really good.<br> Saw a lot of Chinese people eating in there.<br> What are you talking about? You said some restaurant must be good because Chinese people were eating there.<br> That's because it was a Chinese restaurant.<br> I still wanna go.<br> Who wants to come? Oh, I can't.<br> I got two dinner dates tonight, so I gotta get ready.<br> All right, girls' night out.<br> Sorry, but we have to prep that catering thing for tomorrow.<br> Oh, that's right.<br> I wish I could eat in restaurants alone.<br> You should try it.<br> It's a really good thing to do.<br> I just think I'd feel really self-conscious.<br> Like I was on display or something.<br> I was on display once.<br> Nothing like eating alone.<br> I just had a great time with myself.<br> Well, this could be a good story.<br> At dinner.<br> It was so liberating.<br> You know, I don't need people to have fun.<br> I'm fun.<br> I'm a fun girl.<br> Are you a naughty girl? No, just fun.<br> Fun.<br> Good.<br> Fun.<br> -See, I told you you'd have fun.<br> -I know.<br> Although I must say that I totally judge any woman I see eating alone.<br> -Why? -What's wrong with a woman eating alone? Well, obviously something.<br> She's eating alone.<br> Okay, guys.<br> All right! Bring it on, you! Here we go.<br> You know, I've never played my stuff for anyone before.<br> So it's important that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions.<br> You know.<br> You should think of my work as wordless sound poems.<br> -That's what -Oh, my God, play.<br> Well, you know, that was terrific! Really bitchen.<br> Wow! It was so wow! Really? Yeah! I mean, you should play in public.<br> Wow, thanks, you guys.<br> That's I want to play you another piece.<br> I left my helicopter sounds on another disk.<br> I'll be right back, okay? This is so nice.<br> I mean, I am so.<br> God bless my dad for soundproofing the basement.<br> I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.<br> What are you guys talking about? I loved it! It was so moving.<br> It's so different from the stuff you usually hear.<br> You mean, music? I know what you think.<br> Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.<br> Come in.<br> Oh, God! Is that Baywatch? Yes, but I just watch it for the articles.<br> -So is Joey around? -No, he's not back yet.<br> Come in, have a seat.<br> Bow or stern? I don't have a preference.<br> You? I like it in the stern.<br> Of the boat.<br> It's me.<br> Casey and l had a little car trouble.<br> -What happened? -We broke down.<br> I have to get transmission fluid.<br> Tell Kathy that I'm sorry and I'll be there soon.<br> -Why can't you tell her? -I think my time is about to I thought your time ran out.<br> Me too, but I guess I do have Joey's running a little late, and he says he's sorry.<br> I guess it's just you and me, then.<br> -Okay.<br> -Yeah, I think it is.<br> So, what'd you do today? I had an appointment to cut my hair.<br> -Looks great! -And then it got canceled.<br> -I could cut it.<br> -Really? Do you do that? Yeah, I learned at my aunt's dog-grooming shop.<br> What do you say? Dog grooming? Don't make my tail too poofy.<br> You have really great hair.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> I grow it myself.<br> You know who also has great hair is Joey.<br> Yes, Joey has great hair.<br> I'm basically done here.<br> Let me get this hair off your neck.<br> What are you doing? Checking to see if it's even.<br> Looks good.<br> The phone! The phone's making sounds! Hey, dude, it's me.<br> Hey, it's Joey! It looks like we'll be stuck here.<br> I got the fluid.<br> The transmission wasn't there.<br> -What? -It fell out.<br> I just figured we hit a dog.<br> Could you put Kathy on? I want to apologize to her.<br> It's Joey.<br> No, it's fine.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Yeah, no, stop apologizing.<br> It's okay.<br> I'll talk to you tomorrow.<br> I should probably go.<br> I forgot my purse.<br> I really did.<br> I forgot my purse.<br> -This is bad! It's bad! -Horrible! Wait, the kiss or the situation? The kiss was good.<br> -But that's bad! -Here's what we do.<br> -We forget it happened.<br> -What? We swallow our feelings, even if we're unhappy forever.<br> Sound good? Can you really do that? I have to.<br> He's my best friend.<br> And you're seeing him.<br> Chandler, I like Joey a lot.<br> -But with you -No, don't! Don't, see? You're getting me confused.<br> I'm starting to yearn.<br> I'm sorry.<br> If you want to pretend that nothing happened, I can try.<br> I think we have to.<br> Are you still out there? Electrifying Infinite time There's a Starbucks about three blocks down.<br> He's so inspired.<br> Just look at him.<br> Look at him go! Thank you very much! Hey, aren't you up next? -I'm not playing tonight.<br> -Why not? I can't follow Ross.<br> It'd be like those poor bicycle-riding chimps who had to follow the Beatles.<br> No.<br> Ross sucks.<br> The place has emptied because of him.<br> Oh, my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time.<br> I'd give anything to not be appreciated in my own time! You suck too.<br> You're awful.<br> You guys! You suck too! Man! I can't believe I locked myself out again! Hang on, buddy.<br> Oh, my God! What happened? -Did you do all this? Why? -I sure did.<br> It made me feel good to do something nice for my friend.<br> You're amazing.<br> No, this is amazing.<br> A TV that appears as if from nowhere! That's the dream! How did you afford all this? I'm 29.<br> I mean, who needs a savings account? You're the best friend anyone has ever had.<br> I don't know.<br> No, you are.<br> You do this, you give me advice.<br> What you said about focusing on one woman? I'll do that.<br> With Casey? I'll see how things go with Kathy.<br> She's cool.<br> -Or Casey.<br> -No, Kathy.<br> -Could be Casey.<br> -No, Kathy.<br> Consider Casey.<br> I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey.<br> I'll fix you two up.<br> What do you think? That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place.<br> You were really great.<br> You were really, really great.<br> Thanks.<br> Monica tells me you don't want to play anymore because of me and, you know, my talent.<br> Is that true? Well, kind of, yeah.<br> I was trying to be really okay and upbeat about it but I just feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.<br> See, but.<br> Pheebs, that is the exact opposite intent of my music.<br> You know, my music is meant to inspire.<br> If it bothers you this much then I won't play anymore.<br> No, don't do that.<br> How could I live if I knew I was depriving the world of your music? Yeah, okay.<br> -I'd love to, but I have plans on Sunday.<br> -Well, maybe some other time.<br> -Sure.<br> Just give me a call, I'm in the book.<br> -Okay.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> See you.<br> What are you doing? He is cute, and he's a doctor.<br> -How do you know? -Honey, I eavesdrop because I care.<br> -Well, I have plans on Sunday.<br> -With who? -Me.<br> -Oh, God.<br> You are the one who told me how important it is to spend time alone.<br> I can't just go out with that guy when I have plans with myself.<br> Wouldn't be fair to me.<br> So basically you're saying you don't want to cheat on yourself.<br> Well, if you wanna make me sound crazy.<br> Saw the new furniture.<br> Very nice.<br> Joey has the best boyfriend ever! I kissed Kathy.<br> Are you serious? -Does Joey know? -No.<br> Is there any way you think he will understand this? You obviously haven't screwed over your friends.<br> Which we all appreciate.<br> If you'd told him how you felt before you kissed her knowing Joey, he'd have stepped aside.<br> Don't say that! That's not true, is it? Yeah, he loves you.<br> Then why didn't you tell me to do that? I said something to Phoebe.<br> And I thought it was a really good idea.<br> -Yeah, I remember.<br> -Oh, my God! What am I going to do? -You'll have to tell him.<br> -Why do I have to tell him? -Because you do.<br> -Yeah, I know.<br> Would it be okay if I wrote a song about this? I don't know if this is working out.<br> I think.<br> I think I wanna see other people.<br> Wow.<br> Didn't see that coming.<br> It's not that I don't enjoy this.<br> I do.<br> I just wanna see what else is out there.<br> Hey, Guy.<br> What are you doing here? I work across the street.<br> -lt turns out I'm gonna be free Sunday.<br> -I wish you had called me.<br> I just told them I'd work this weekend.<br> Okay, well, maybe next weekend.<br> -Definitely.<br> I'll see you.<br> -Okay.<br> Yeah, you'll be talking to me never, because you're a freak who eats alone.<br> Sambuca margarita? It that a real thing? Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.<br> Listen, Joe.<br> I need to I need to talk to you about something.<br> What's up? It's about Kathy.<br> I like her.<br> I like her a lot, actually.<br> -You do? -Yeah.<br> Your timing couldn't be better.<br> She's not my girlfriend anymore.<br> What? -Yeah, she broke up with me.<br> -When? Just now, after acting class.<br> I thought she was doing some scene, so I let people watch.<br> Man, I am so sorry.<br> Are you okay? I've been better, but I'm all right.<br> So you like her? Yes, but I don't have to.<br> No, it's okay.<br> You know why? Because you came to me first.<br> I thought that would be the best thing to do.<br> You might have your work cut out for you.<br> When I talked to her, I got the feeling she's into some other guy.<br> See, that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.<br> I think I know who the other guy is.<br> Who? It's me.<br> I'm the other guy.<br> What? When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking and one thing led to another, and.<br> And what? Did you sleep with her? -No, I just kissed her.<br> -What? That's even worse! -How is that worse? -It's the same! There's nothing I could do.<br> I think I'm in love with her! Who cares? You went behind my back? I'd never do that to you! I have no excuses.<br> I was totally over the line.<br> You're so far past the line, that you can't even see the line! The line is a dot to you! Yes, right! And I feel horrible.<br> You have to believe me.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Is that why you bought all this stuff? You know what? I will not watch your TV.<br> I won't listen to your stereo.<br> And there's a loaf in the new bread maker I won't eat.<br> Know why? -Probably because -It's all tainted with your betrayal! This apartment is empty to me! I'm not happy about you either.<br> And just so you know I made that bread for you.<br> Oh, my God! He's lost it.<br> He's totally lost it.<br> What? This cannot get any worse.<br> Rats in the basement are hanging themselves.<br> Thank you.<br> Thanks.<br> I lost it.<br> I won't play anymore.<br> Would you? Can you finish my set? After that? Yeah.<br> No, I mean, if I can help.<br> Yeah, like I could lose it.<br> What? I played bad on purpose, guys.<br> Okay, you were trying to play bad this whole time.<br> No.<br> Just that last song.<br>   <br>
