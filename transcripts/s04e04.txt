                    			Hey, new wallet? It was time.<br> The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say "cool" anymore.<br> Rachel, you just put an empty carton back in the fridge.<br> I know, but the garbage was full.<br> Have you ever taken out the trash? Since you've lived here? Well, I thought you liked doing it.<br> -Third door on the left.<br> -Right! Hey, Mr.<br> Treeger.<br> What are you doing? I'm sorry.<br> It's a little old but.<br> You're clogging up the chute I just unclogged.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I don't come in here a lot.<br> Of course not.<br> You're a little princess.<br> Daddy, buy me a pizza.<br> Daddy, buy me a candy factory.<br> Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing "Happy Birthday" to me.<br> You think you can come here make a mess and a big man in coveralls will clean it up? Think of someone else for a change.<br> Okay, I'm sorry.<br> God, if you're going to cry about it! The One With Ballroom Dancing Treeger made you cry? He said really mean things that were only partly true.<br> I'll teach him a lesson.<br> Joey, don't.<br> Let's forget about it.<br> That's easy for you to say.<br> You weren't almost just killed! All right, that's it.<br> School is in session! Is this a gym card? Oh, yeah, gym member.<br> I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.<br> So why don't you quit? You don't think I've tried? You think I like having $50 a month taken from my account? They make you go all the way down there.<br> They use all these phrases and peppiness to confuse you.<br> And then they bring out Maria.<br> -Who is Maria? -Oh, Maria! You can't say no to her.<br> She's like this lycra, spandex-covered, gym treat.<br> Do you need me to go with you and hold your hand? You're strong enough to face her? Oh, no.<br> You'll have to come.<br> Tribbiani.<br> Hold on.<br> I'll get the plunger.<br> You hold on.<br> You made my friend Rachel cry.<br> So you'll go and apologize to her unless you want me to call the landlord.<br> And tell him what? Maybe you haven't heard of "not making girls cry.<br>" Maybe you haven't heard of the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.<br> I have actually not heard of that.<br> Your friends are violating it.<br> I've been nice until now, but I don't need this grief.<br> I'm telling the landlord Monica's illegally subletting her grandmother's place.<br> Your friends are out of here, pal.<br> Why don't you tell me something I don't know? Somebody tell me I don't have to work today.<br> What's the matter? My first massage is this incredibly gorgeous guy.<br> Every time I see him, I want to do things to him I can't charge for.<br> So do them for free.<br> No, it is forbidden.<br> Mrs.<br> Potter fires people for messing around with clients.<br> And it's against my oath as a masseuse.<br> -They make you take an oath? -No, I made myself take one.<br> No fooling around with clients and always be prepared.<br> That one's from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.<br> Why not give him to someone else? No, I can handle it.<br> I'm a professional.<br> Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet? You got a pedicure.<br> Your feet are all dressed up.<br> That's the only part he can see when he's on the table! You're going to do some feet flirting! I don't know what you're talking about.<br> How do you explain the toe ring? It's Arabian Princess Day at work.<br> Leave me alone! My hero! What happened? I told him no one treats my friends like that.<br> And he better apologize.<br> See you! Wait a minute.<br> What did he say? He wouldn't apologize because you're living here illegally.<br> Instead, he'll evict you.<br> See you later! -You got us evicted? -I told you not to go down there.<br> He made Rachel cry! Rachel always cries! That's not true! You go down there, and you suck up to him.<br> You suck like you've never sucked before! All right, I'll try.<br> If I can't, you stay with us till you get settled.<br> -Go! -All right, all right.<br> I'll have to check first, but he'll be cool.<br> Remember what we talked about.<br> You got to be strong.<br> Now one more time.<br> Don't you want a washboard stomach and rock-hard pecs? No, I want a flabby gut and saggy man-breasts.<br> That's good.<br> I want to quit the gym.<br> You want to quit? I want to quit the gym.<br> You do realize you won't have access to our new Swedish spa? I want to quit the gym.<br> Dave in the membership office handles quitters.<br> Excuse me.<br> Are you a member? Me? Sorry.<br> Members only.<br> I want to quit the gym! It's okay, man.<br> Be strong.<br> Are you a member of any gym? No, and I'm not going to be.<br> So save your little speech.<br> Okay, no problem.<br> Could you come here? Hi, I'm Maria.<br> You have really pretty feet.<br> These old things? Would you spend time on my sciatic area? It's killing me.<br> You mean.<br> By sciatic, you mean the towel-covered portion? Sure, I can do that.<br> Because the muscles in the sciatic area can get real nice and tight.<br> So tell me, Rick, how did you injure the area? A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.<br> -Did you just bite me? -No! Please don't kick the girls out.<br> This was my fault.<br> You want me to kick you guys out instead? You can't.<br> Where would the chick and the duck live? You have pets? Those are nicknames.<br> I'm the "chick," and Chandler's the "duck.<br>" I would've thought it was the other way around.<br> Come on.<br> Let the girls stay.<br> I'll do whatever you want.<br> Really? You'd do anything? Yeah, absolutely.<br> I got something.<br> What is it? Can you be my dancing partner? That's not prison lingo, is it? I want to quit the gym.<br> Can you honestly tell me that you're Yes, yes.<br> Most of the time.<br> I mean, sure, I have my bad days, but then I remember what a cute smile I have.<br> We were voted "Best-equipped Gym in New York" two years running.<br> -Do you really want to give that up? -Yes, I hate it here.<br> Everything that you have in here is very heavy.<br> Really? Okay? You want to make your friend work out alone? -What friend? -Your friend Ross.<br> Just joined.<br> His dancing partner? There's this superintendents' dance, "The Super Ball.<br>" He wants to impress Marge, this lady super he likes.<br> Why not practice with a girl? He's too shy.<br> He's not good enough to dance with girls yet.<br> Yeah, right.<br> He almost danced me right down that garbage chute.<br> Would you let it go already? You're fine.<br> So did you quit? I almost did.<br> Couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter.<br> Wait, now, so you joined the gym? And that's funny, why? I was just, you know, picturing you working out, and.<br> Well, that's it.<br> We're doomed.<br> They'll take $50 a month from our accounts for the rest of our lives.<br> What are we gonna do? You could actually go to the gym.<br> Or we could go to the bank close our accounts and cut them off at the source.<br> You're a genius.<br> Oh, man! But then, we won't be bank buddies.<br> Now there's two reasons.<br> You guys, remember that cute client I told you about? I bit him.<br> -Where? -On the tushy.<br> And that's not against your oath? I know, but the moment I touch him I want to throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.<br> Next time, try to distract yourself.<br> Like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't want to get too excited.<br> I try and think of other things.<br> Like sandwiches and baseball and Chandler.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Oh, no, thank you.<br> All right, I'm here.<br> Let's get this over with.<br> Okay, well just follow my lead.<br> Don't we need to do some kind of preparation first? Like get really drunk? Come on.<br> Hey, just put your arms around me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> No.<br> It's okay.<br> But if I'm Marge my breasts are coming out my back.<br> Forget it! I'm not being any good at this.<br> My mom was right.<br> I'm just a big potato with arms and legs and a head.<br> Come on, man.<br> You're not a potato.<br> I'm sure as hell not a dancer.<br> It's no use.<br> Marge will never go for me.<br> Come on, Treeger.<br> Don't say that.<br> You just need more practice.<br> Come on.<br> Let's try it again.<br> Plus, it was probably mostly my fault anyway.<br> I'm not that comfortable dancing with a So how goes the dancing? Gay yet? You guys owe me bigtime.<br> What was that? You just did a little dancy thing.<br> -No, I didn't.<br> -Yes, you did.<br> -You did a little hop.<br> -You are so enjoying this.<br> No, I'm not.<br> And it wasn't a hop.<br> It was a pas de bourree.<br> You know the words! You are so into this! Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.<br> I'm getting pretty good at it.<br> This is so sweet.<br> Joey, our little twinkletoes.<br> This isn't some kind of girly dance.<br> It's like a sport, it's manly.<br> -Show me some "manly" moves.<br> -All right.<br> I don't know how to lead.<br> Hello.<br> We'd like to close our accounts.<br> Close your accounts? Is there a problem? No, we'd just like to close them.<br> Ms.<br> Lambert handles all our closures.<br> Would you come over here, please? Hi, I'm Karen.<br> I want to quit the bank! Okay.<br> Baseball.<br> Rick playing baseball.<br> He slides into second.<br> Maybe even his pants come down a little.<br> Okay, sandwiches.<br> Sandwiches.<br> Okay, on a plate.<br> Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.<br> Chandler.<br> Okay, Chandler.<br> That's working! Chandler's knees.<br> Chandler's ankles.<br> Chandler's ankle hair.<br> Oh, no! Okay, you're all set.<br> Wow! That was amazing! Was that really just an hour? In really long-hour world.<br> What? I have an enormous crush on you.<br> But since you're a client, I can't ask you out even though you give me the feelings.<br> I had no idea.<br> I can always find another masseuse.<br> Really? Yeah, really.<br> What? Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.<br> Quiet down.<br> Mr.<br> Simon's been waiting Oh, my God! Why wasn't I offered that? I'd definitely pay more for that.<br> We have rules here.<br> This is not that kind of place.<br> I know, but this isn't how it looks at all because Rick is my husband.<br> Oh, really? You'd better tell his other wife.<br> She called three times asking where he is.<br> Yes, I will tell her.<br> So you didn't leave the bank? And somehow we ended up with a joint checking account.<br> What will you ever use that for? To pay for the gym.<br> So I had a great day.<br> Rick and I hit it off.<br> We were making out.<br> Then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.<br> -You got fired? -Oh, my gosh! It's so weird.<br> I have never been fired from anything.<br> Sweetie.<br> I started walking around, not knowing what to do next.<br> I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages.<br> Then these policemen thought I was a whore too.<br> It's really been a bad day, whore-wise.<br> Hey, Duck.<br> Is Chick here? Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.<br> Ready for our last practice? We're not getting that spin right because my place is too small.<br> -Want to use our place? -No, I had another idea.<br> We did it! That was incredible! That was amazing! We totally nailed it! Hey, listen.<br> Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.<br> Oh, my God! Look at the time.<br> I got to catch the bus to the ball.<br> Good luck.<br> Unless you want to practice the fox trot.<br> Or the tango? Thanks, but no.<br> You see, I think I'm ready to dance with girls.<br> -Go get them, Treeger.<br> -Right.<br> You want to come? Marge has a friend.<br> Really? You'd dance good with her.<br> She's the same size as me.<br> No, I'm good.<br> It looks like you've got great experience.<br> Let's see.<br> Reason for leaving last job? They thought I was a whore.<br> Okay.<br> We'll give you a call if anything comes up.<br> Great.<br> Thank you very much.<br>   <br>
