                    			Hey, hon? Would you help me get the plates down? Hey, here's an idea.<br> Why don't we use our wedding china today? No, I think we should save our china for something really special.<br> Like if the queen of England comes over.<br> Honey, she keeps canceling on us.<br> Take the hint.<br> What if something breaks? They're expensive.<br> What is the point of having them if we never use them? Okay.<br> But if something breaks and then the queen comes over - I will explain it to her.<br> - Like I'd let you talk to the queen.<br> The parade is really good this year.<br> Man, those horses can crap.<br> Next up is a marching band "from Muskogee", "Oklahoma.<br>" Muskogee? That's like four hours from Tulsa! Here's the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of our Lives.<br> Oh, my God! Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap "Days of our Lives"? I forgot! I'm supposed to be there! I can't believe I forgot! I usually write stuff like this down on my arm! Stupid long sleeves! - What are you gonna do? - I'll come up with a good reason why I wasn't there.<br> The producers are gonna be mad.<br> They sat us down and said: "Everyone has to be there, 6 a.<br>m.<br> Sharp.<br> That means you, Tribbiani.<br>" Like I was some kind of idiot.<br> Well, you proved them wrong.<br> The One With Rachel's Other Sister mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Oh, Emma.<br> This is your first Thanksgiving.<br> What are you thankful for? Mommy's boobies? A lot of people are thankful for those.<br> Hello? Rachel? Who is it? It's your favorite sister.<br> - Jill? - Amy! Hide my rings.<br> Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.<br> Do you have a hair straightener? Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Hair straightener.<br> - I haven't seen you in, like, a year.<br> - I know.<br> I know.<br> I've just been crazed.<br> Well, me too.<br> I had a baby.<br> I decorated Dad's office.<br> Yeah? Well, unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing.<br> About that hair straightener, honey, I really need one.<br> I'm gonna have dinner at my boyfriend's house.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Is this Emmett? It's Emma.<br> It's a girl? - Hey, Amy.<br> - Amy, you remember Ross? Not really.<br> But you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date.<br> That was me.<br> No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since, like, the ninth grade.<br> Still me.<br> No, I'm not talking about you.<br> It was your fat friend's brother with that bad Afro.<br> Okay, Amy, I'm gonna save you some time, okay? All me! Careful.<br> Careful.<br> Careful! I'll tell you what.<br> For the rest of our lives I'll be careful until told otherwise.<br> - This isn't the china we picked out.<br> - I know.<br> After you left the store, I chose different ones.<br> - Why? - Your taste is a little feminine for me.<br> Suddenly flowers are feminine? Hey, everybody! Happy Thanksgiving! - Happy Thanksgiving.<br> Pheebs! - What's going on, Joe? Listen, I need a good lie.<br> Okay.<br> How about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing, you know? You can see the strings, people! No, no, no.<br> I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.<br> - Honey, you stink at lying.<br> - I do not.<br> Really? Let me ask you something.<br> Yesterday at the coffeehouse I went to the bathroom.<br> When I came back, my muffin was gone.<br> Who took it? Somebody opened the door to the coffeehouse and a raccoon ran in and went straight for your muffin.<br> I said: "Hey, don't eat that! That's Phoebe's! " And he said He said, "Joey, you stink at lying.<br>" What am I gonna do? Don't worry.<br> We'll come up with a lie.<br> I'll help you.<br> - Great.<br> That'd be great.<br> Thank you.<br> - Sure.<br> What was the work thing? - "Pick up Grandma at the airport.<br>" - Oh, man! She's precious.<br> Do you ever worry that she's gonna get your real nose? Amy Yes, I do.<br> I really do.<br> Hello? Yeah, hang on, one sec.<br> Can I take this upstairs? Sure.<br> We don't live there, but Seriously? It's just these rooms? - I thought you were a doctor.<br> - Yeah.<br> No, Ross has a Ph.<br>D.<br> God, she is unbelievable.<br> I know.<br> I mean, a Ph.<br>D.<br> Is just as good as an MD.<br> Sure, Ross, yeah! If I have a heart attack at a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.<br> - Stupid Thanksgiving.<br> - What? - What? What happened? - My boyfriend canceled on me.<br> I mean, I finally find a real relationship.<br> Someone that I can spend this day with, and then his wife comes back into town! I swear, it's almost not even worth dating married guys.<br> Don't say that.<br> God, I was so looking forward to this.<br> It was gonna be such a beautiful Thanksgiving.<br> We were gonna have sushi.<br> Amy, don't cry.<br> - Ross, can I talk to you in private? - Sure, you wanna go upstairs, or? Look, I was thinking, if it's okay with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.<br> I think that's a great idea.<br> It'll be like the Pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.<br> Look, I know she's a little tough to take.<br> But she has nowhere else to go, and she's my sister.<br> She's Emma's aunt.<br> - And I would like them to bond.<br> - I don't want them bonding too much.<br> I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.<br> Ross, she may need one.<br> We're just gonna have to make our peace with that! - Hi! - Hey.<br> Hey, you guys.<br> This is my sister, Amy.<br> This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and you know Mon.<br> Oh, my God.<br> You're on "Days of our Lives"! Yeah.<br> Wow! They must put a lot of makeup on you.<br> Happy Thanksgiving.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> So welcome.<br> Is this the first time you're seeing Emma? Yeah, I think so.<br> It's nice to meet you, Emma.<br> - Phoebe.<br> - That's a funny noise.<br> - Pheebs? I still need some help here.<br> - Right.<br> Okay.<br> So it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it.<br> For example if you look at the ground when you talk, people know you're lying.<br> I don't know why this is so hard for me.<br> Lying is basically just acting and I am a terrific actor.<br> - You are a terrific actor.<br> - Hey.<br> Where's the baby? - We just put her down for a nap.<br> Listen, I was just thinking.<br> You know what would be incredible? If you guys died! Thank you, Amy.<br> No, no, then I would get the baby.<br> It would be just like a movie.<br> At first I wouldn't know what to do with her.<br> And then I would rise to the occasion.<br> Then I'd get a makeover and get married.<br> That's a great movie! Yeah.<br> Listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything because you know, you'd be dead.<br> But I was thinking about changing her name.<br> I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.<br> Emma.<br> Emma? Ross wants you.<br> Phoebe! Why does she keep making that noise? Honey, I don't know how to tell you this but if something were to happen to Ross or myself you wouldn't get the baby.<br> - Well, who would? Well, we haven't officially asked them yet but we would want Monica and Chandler.<br> I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.<br> Oh, my God, I'm so moved.<br> I don't believe this.<br> Hold on a second.<br> You guys die and I don't get your baby? Amy, see, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.<br> We see them every day.<br> And truthfully, you don't seem connected to the baby.<br> Connected? To what? She's a lump.<br> You know, guys, I've gotta say this means so much to me.<br> I mean, that you would trust me with your child.<br> I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own.<br> You know, I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but That you two - That you two - This guy? Seriously? Okay, it's time for dinner.<br> Everyone, we're using our fancy china and it's very expensive, so please be careful.<br> Okay, just to be clear, comedy with the plates will not be well-received.<br> Hey! How come my plate's less fancy than everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate? No, honey.<br> That's a special plate.<br> See, it's a game.<br> Whoever gets that plate wins.<br> I can't believe I won! You know, this is such a slap in the face.<br> I mean, I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.<br> Monica is Ross' sister.<br> No, Ross' sister was really fat.<br> That was me.<br> No, she was this dorky girl in school who followed Rachel around like a puppy Amy, you've got to stop doing that! Okay, listen, I know you're having a bit of a family crisis but you don't have to take it out on the plates.<br> I mean, in fact, I think that everyone should cut their food like this: Now, see? This way, you protect the plates and let's face it, you have fun.<br> Okay, how about this? If you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies then do I get the baby? - No, if crazy plate lady If Monica dies, then I would get Emma.<br> Right? - Well, actually - Actually what? It's just It's just that in that case then Emma would go to my parents.<br> - What? - Hurts, doesn't it? Who has to die for me to get her? So if Monica's not around, I'm not good enough to raise Emma? No, that is not what we're saying.<br> Yeah, he's lying.<br> He looked down.<br> Well, what's wrong with me? Am I incompetent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you! You're taking this the wrong way.<br> We think you'll be a wonderful parent.<br> It's just You're more the, you know, fun parent.<br> Yeah, and we wanna make sure Emma also has someone like Monica who's more of a disciplinarian.<br> Someone who can be firm and strict.<br> That's not how you see me, is it? No, you're all about the fun.<br> I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable? No.<br> You both are equally capable.<br> It's just you're strongest when you're together.<br> Okay.<br> So if we both had Emma, and I died she'd have to give her up.<br> Sure.<br> Monica would have to give her up.<br> I lie better than that, right? Let me just get this straight.<br> So my two friends die, I get Emma.<br> Then my wife dies.<br> Then Emma, the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me? - There's your movie.<br> Hey, there you are.<br> - You disappeared after dinner.<br> - Did somebody miss me? Was there a child to raise poorly? Ross and Rachel don't know what they're saying.<br> It's not like they're so responsible.<br> Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five-year-old condom.<br> No, but they're right.<br> I'm not a strong father figure, and I never will be.<br> No, you learn these things.<br> You grow into it.<br> Yeah, but it's not who I am.<br> Everything they said is exactly why I was worried about having a kid.<br> And it's true.<br> - And look, everybody knows it.<br> - I don't know it.<br> I wanna have a kid with you because I think you'll be an amazing dad.<br> At the fun parts and at the hard parts.<br> Well, can you picture me saying, "Go to your room, you're grounded"? Can you hear me say, "You're grounded"? You said that to me last week.<br> How hard is it? "No shoes on the furniture!" The producer from "Days" left a message asking why I wasn't at the parade.<br> They said everybody's really pissed off at me.<br> And they all got to meet Santa! It's okay.<br> I thought of the perfect lie for you.<br> It's easy to remember, and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.<br> You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.<br> I like that! Yeah! I wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.<br> What happened? - My sister's raccoon came - No, nothing with a raccoon! - Wait, what are you doing? - Setting the table.<br> We thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.<br> How nice.<br> Maybe later we can all blow our noses on my wedding dress.<br> Hey, dude, you okay? Sorry about before.<br> That's okay.<br> You're totally right.<br> I don't know anything about disciplining a child.<br> But it did hurt my feelings, and I want you to know that if I die you don't get Joey.<br> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.<br> You know, this is just This is classic Rachel.<br> Right.<br> Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby? This might be my one chance to have a child, Rachel.<br> I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my career - What career? - I'm a decorator.<br> You decorate Dad's office and now you're a decorator? Okay, I went to the zoo yesterday, now I'm a koala bear.<br> - Why can't you ever be supportive? - You want to talk supportive? You didn't come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby! You didn't come see me in the hospital when I was getting my lips done! I did the first time.<br> You know what? You want to know why I am not giving Emily to you? - Emma.<br> - Whose side are you on?! I'm not giving you Emma because you can't handle the responsibility of a child.<br> Well, how hard could it be? You do it.<br> You wanna know why you don't want me to have the baby? Because you don't want me to be happy.<br> - You have always been jealous of me.<br> - Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsibility? Your immaturity? Your total disregard for other people's feelings? To name a few.<br> You've always been like this.<br> You had to have everything, and I couldn't have anything.<br> Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me.<br> I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me? Timmy was my boyfriend, and you made out with him! Come on, that was 20 years ago.<br> Get over it.<br> I cannot believe that I invited you here today! Yeah, well, you know what I cannot believe? That my so-called sister gets a 30%"%" discount from Ralph Lauren, and I still have to pay retail? It's 45.<br> You bitch.<br> You just think you're so perfect with your new baby and your small apartment.<br> Well, let me tell you something.<br> Your baby isn't even that cute.<br> Too far, Amy.<br> Too far.<br> - You take that back.<br> - No.<br> - Take it back! - No.<br> What are you gonna do? Make me? Hey, man, I work out! - So do I.<br> - I do Pilates.<br> - I do yoga.<br> - Bring it on! Put the plates in the boxes! Put the plates in the boxes! - Did you just push me? - Yeah, I think I did.<br> All right, that's it.<br> Forget the bubble wrap! There isn't time! Frizzy, frizzy, frizzy! - Shouldn't we stop this? - Are you out of your mind? Let's throw some Jell-O on them! Gross! All right, that is it! This is our apartment, and you cannot behave this way! If you can't act your age, you shouldn't be here at all.<br> Those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones that I picked out but they're important to Monica.<br> And I want you to apologize to her, now.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Mon, I'm so sorry.<br> Okay.<br> That's better.<br> Now, I want you to apologize to each other and mean it.<br> - Sorry.<br> - Sorry.<br> By the way, that fight was totally arousing.<br> Dude, well done.<br> If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies, you can totally take care of Emma.<br> Yeah? Well, thanks.<br> So So now do I get Joey? Okay.<br> But you should know he eats a lot and shoves pennies up his nose.<br> Are you okay, Mon? I mean, these things happen.<br> I mean, it's just a plate.<br> - It's not like somebody died.<br> - It's all right.<br> You can mourn.<br> Thank you.<br> It was so beautiful! I'm gonna go to Joey's and get the pies.<br> Actually, not pies.<br> It's just pie.<br> I don't care.<br> Oh, my God, I've lost the will to scold.<br> Look, Amy we got a little a little out-of-control over there.<br> And I'm sorry.<br> You're my sister and if it really means that much to you - So you're gonna give me the baby? - No, I was I was gonna let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.<br> You are not gonna regret this.<br> - She needs changing.<br> - No, no, no.<br> I'll get her.<br> I am super confident, totally responsible and fourth in line to raise Emma.<br> I'll be right there, Emma! Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here.<br> Well, what do you know? I guess I'll be the one who dies first.<br> - Does Monica know about her plates? - Nope.<br> - Broke them all, huh? - Yep.<br> - You gonna tell her? - Nope.<br> Hey.<br> So I'm gonna put the plates back.<br> I think you're right.<br> We shouldn't use these plates for a long time.<br> - Like only if the queen comes? - Maybe not even then.<br> Hey.<br> I did it.<br> I told my producer I had a family emergency.<br> He totally bought it.<br> - Thanks for teaching me how to lie.<br> - No problem.<br> Next week, stealing.<br> - Bye, plates.<br> - You told her you broke all the plates? What?! Something happened with the plates? Yeah, this raccoon came in   <br>
