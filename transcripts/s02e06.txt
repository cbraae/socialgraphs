You did pretty well.<br> $8.<br> 27.<br> But not really, because I put in the first two.<br> Just to get the ball rolling and to make myself feel better.<br> Do you? You know, this whole playing for money thing is so not good for me.<br> I don't know, when l sang "Su-su-suicide"  I got, like, $ 1.<br> 75.<br> But then "Smelly Cat"? I got 25 cents and a condom.<br> So, you know, now I just feel really bad for "Smelly Cat.<br>" Honey, I don't think everybody gets "Smelly Cat.<br>" I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then whoosh! But it's not even that, you know? I used to do my songs because it made me happy.<br> Now it's just all about the money, you know? Well, people missed you in there.<br> In fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat.<br>" Really? From who? Well, me.<br> And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.<br> Did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Thanks a lot.<br> Hey, Christine! I got it! I want to thank you for being there for me.<br> And I'm sorry I almost broke your hand.<br> That's okay.<br> I'm sorry I poisoned you.<br> Remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand? Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? What about the time I hit you in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin? Remember when I stuck that broom in your spokes and you hit your head on the curb? But I remember people telling me about it.<br> I hope Ben has a little sister.<br> And I hope she can kick his ass.<br> I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.<br> How about the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
