                    			So, what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for? Our news.<br> My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa.<br> So as of Monday, I'm being officially relocated.<br> - Oh, my God! - What? Monday? - How long do you have to go for? - They said it could be up to a year.<br> - A year? - Well, do you have to go? Well, I kind of have to, don't I? Because of this stupid thing.<br> There's nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh? Wait a minute.<br> Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.<br> Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets to the Jets game next week! I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be able to make it.<br> But we were gonna go see the Jets! You can't go.<br> I mean, you're the glue that holds this group together.<br> - Really? - Not you.<br> I can't believe you guys are moving.<br> - I call their apartment! - No! The One With the Pediatrician mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 - Here you go, Rach.<br> - Thank you, Joey.<br> You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.<br> I went through this with Ben and Carol.<br> One coffee won't affect your milk.<br> Just to be sure, I'm gonna call Dr.<br> Wiener.<br> Every time? You don't have to call him whenever you have a question, okay? - Trust me.<br> I know this.<br> - All right.<br> I trust you.<br> I can see you dialing.<br> I don't understand why I'm on the phone! Dr.<br> Wiener? It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.<br> It's just so grownup.<br> I know, yeah.<br> I feel like we're all growing up.<br> A person named "Wiener.<br>" God, that kills me.<br> - Look at you all grownup.<br> - Well, actually, you know what? I am, you know? Well, that whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship, you know? Like, I'd like to meet a nice, mature, commitment-minded lady.<br> And looks aren't as important as Nah, she's gotta be hot.<br> You know, I might know somebody.<br> How about you set me up with someone, and we double-date? I can do that.<br> Yeah.<br> How's Friday? - Done! - All right.<br> Good, really? Okay, let's see.<br> All right.<br> You know who's great? Sandy Poopack.<br> "Poopack"? Yeah.<br> All right.<br> Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.<br> - I've got good news.<br> - You got out of the whole Tulsa thing? Okay, I have news.<br> You don't have to move to Tulsa.<br> You can stay here and keep your job.<br> That's great! How? My boss and I worked out a deal where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.<br> So the other three, I can be here with you.<br> So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.<br> I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that? No.<br> I can't be away from you for that long.<br> - Really? - Yeah, you're my husband.<br> I won't live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.<br> That's fast math.<br> We could use you in Tulsa.<br> Thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you go to Tulsa, I go with you.<br> You said that without gagging.<br> I know! Well, excuse me? Oh, yeah? Well, up yours too! - Who the hell was that? - Dr.<br> Wiener.<br> Rach, you can't call people at 3:00 in the morning.<br> You know what? You sound just like his wife.<br> Was there anything even wrong with Emma? Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane.<br> What was it? Hiccups.<br> I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.<br> Well, not anymore I can't.<br> He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician.<br> Wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up you liked your doctor.<br> What was his name? Dr.<br> Gettleman? Yeah, no, I don't think that's a good idea.<br> In fact, I think he's dead.<br> Why does everything happen to me? I promise, first thing tomorrow, we'll find another doctor.<br> But I gotta get up early, and I'm not feeling well.<br> You're not feeling well? What do you have? Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.<br> You know, come to think of it, it does feel rubella-like.<br> Wiener! Wiener! Wiener! Wiener! Rachel! Great! Now he's gonna know it was me! So how is this for our big double date tonight? Oh, my God.<br> Great.<br> Just the reaction I was hoping for.<br> Yeah, so you found someone for me? You didn't forget? Of course not.<br> And you'll love Mary Ellen.<br> She's really smart and cute and funny and I can't tell you how I know this, but she is not opposed to threesomes.<br> All right.<br> - So tell me something about my guy.<br> - No.<br> Come on, give me something.<br> What's his name? - Mike.<br> - Mike.<br> Okay, what's his last name? Damn it! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore?! We'll see you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.<br> All right, great.<br> See you.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said? There's no guys in there! It's impossible to find a good doctor.<br> How do you know the good ones from the ones who'll push their penis against your knee? Excuse me? I know what she's talking about.<br> Well, we've gotta find a new pediatrician.<br> Ross was getting sick last night, and Emma may have caught it.<br> - Why don't you see Dr.<br> Gettleman? - Ross said he died.<br> He didn't die.<br> I just saw his daughter last week.<br> She said he was fine.<br> Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.<br> Great.<br> Well then, I'm gonna take Emma to see him.<br> I wonder why Ross said that he died? Maybe he confused him with his childhood therapist.<br> He saw a therapist? He used to have a recurring nightmare.<br> It freaked him out.<br> Wow, what was it? That I was going to eat him.<br> Mike! Yeah? Okay.<br> I can't believe I'm doing this with you.<br> Although I did just end a nine-year relationship so I should be open to taking some risks.<br> It'll be fine.<br> Follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.<br> - I am Mike.<br> - Attaboy.<br> Here they come.<br> - I'm Phoebe.<br> - Phoebe.<br> Mike.<br> How you doing? - Nice to meet you.<br> - Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.<br> So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other, anyway? How do Joey and I know each other? If I had a nickel for every time somebody's asked me that.<br> - From school.<br> - We met in college.<br> I mean high school.<br> You guys go way back, then.<br> So, what are you up to these days? - Well, I'm a lawyer.<br> - Mike, attorney at law! - Actually, I just gave up my practice.<br> - What? That's the kind of thing you usually run by me.<br> I want to play piano professionally.<br> If I don't do this now, I never will.<br> Great.<br> I like that better than the lawyer thing.<br> Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.<br> You thought he was still a lawyer.<br> No, that's not what I meant.<br> Let's get you a cocktail.<br> What are you doing? Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.<br> That's so sweet.<br> Did you find anything? - Slim Pickins.<br> - Nothing, huh? No.<br> Slim Pickins.<br> It's a barbecue joint.<br> They're looking for a cook.<br> Actually, "cook" may be a bit of a stretch.<br> They're looking for somebody to shovel mesquite.<br> "Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.<br> Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.<br> Honey, that's okay.<br> I know this woman, Nancy who's a restaurant biz headhunter.<br> She may know something.<br> Can I say how much I appreciate you coming with me? When we get to Tulsa, I am taking you for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.<br> So Cheesy? Whole Hog? It's gonna be tough to keep kosher in Tulsa.<br> Hi, Nancy? Hi, it's Monica Geller.<br> I'm good.<br> Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa.<br> Yeah, well, my husband's been relocated.<br> Because I love him.<br> No, I don't want a job in New York.<br> Javu's looking? Oh, my God! He asked for me personally? Oh, my God! Wow, this is really, really flattering.<br> But I'm moving to Tulsa.<br> So, just, if you would tell Javu I'll take it! My name's Rachel Greene.<br> I have an appointment for Emma.<br> Dr.<br> Gettleman is finishing up with a patient.<br> He'll be out shortly.<br> I think you just have a cold.<br> It's definitely not strep.<br> Thanks, doctor.<br> - Would you like a lollipop? - Do you even have to ask? He is alive! It's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.<br> That's because we had a bit of a falling out.<br> Mike hit my mom with a car.<br> - No, I didn't.<br> - That's okay.<br> I have forgiven you.<br> Now we're friends again, and everything's great.<br> Well, wait.<br> Is your mom okay? Please, we're trying to have a conversation.<br> You're a lot nicer on "Days of Our Lives.<br>" "Days of Our Lives"! That's why you look so familiar! - What? - What? What? Do you not know each other? Of course we do.<br> He's playing a game we used to play in high school.<br> We pretend we don't know each other.<br> We played all kinds of games.<br> You remember that one where I punch you in the face for not being cool? Let me ask you something: How many sisters does Joey have? - Six.<br> - What are you doing? I said seven! Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger? Because I forgot about our date.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I'm sorry too.<br> And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.<br> You are unbelievable.<br> I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you.<br> Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.<br> Who are you kidding? You find some guy off the street for me? God, this is humiliating! I'm so sorry.<br> If you don't like this guy, I can find you a better one.<br> Mike? Mike? I'm out of here.<br> It was nice meeting you.<br> - You're leaving too? - I'll stay if you can tell me my name.<br> Have a good night.<br> We leave tomorrow, and you still have a lot to pack.<br> You're right.<br> Maybe I shouldn't go.<br> What? So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javu? But it's just a little outside of Tulsa.<br> Well, how far outside? Manhattan? And you're thinking of taking it? Before, you said that being with me was more important than any job.<br> But I guess now it's old job, me, new job.<br> I'm gonna miss this hand! I know this is a lot to ask but, my God, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<br> What happened to "you can't live without me four days a week"? Well, if you really think about it, I mean, four days is not that long.<br> I see you Monday before you go to work and Thursday when you get back and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it it's really just one day.<br> And well, if we can't make it one day, we got real problems, my friend.<br> - I think you should take the job.<br> - Really? I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.<br> That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me.<br> - How was the pediatrician? - I really liked him.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> It was really, really, really good.<br> - You promised not to say anything.<br> - I know.<br> Ross still sees his pediatrician! I don't care.<br> Are you serious? You still see Dr.<br> Gettleman? He is a brilliant diagnostician! Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer? Seriously, you gotta go to an appropriate doctor.<br> Why? I know it's a little weird, but he is a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history.<br> And every time I go in there, he makes a big deal.<br> You know, "Look, it's my favorite patient.<br>" Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your tushy? I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college.<br> That was not a security blanket.<br> That was a wall hanging.<br> It didn't spend much time on the wall! Excuse me.<br> Hi.<br> I was hoping to run into you.<br> Can we talk? Sure.<br> I'm sorry, really.<br> I'm so embarrassed that our Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.<br> Just ask my parole officer.<br> Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.<br> Well, why did you go along with that? Because I was told that I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't.<br> And that I'd meet a pretty girl, which I did.<br> That's true.<br> Well, is anything you told me about yourself true? My name is Mike.<br> And I do play piano.<br> - Prove it.<br> - There isn't a piano here.<br> That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.<br> Okay.<br> You are really good.<br> - I play a little guitar myself.<br> - Really? That's great.<br> - What kind of music do you play? - Like acoustic, folksy stuff, you know? But right now I'm working on a couple Iron Maiden covers.<br> Do you think that, maybe, sometime, I could It's okay.<br> Go ahead, ask me out.<br> Okay.<br> You think, maybe, sometime I could take you out? You just caught me off guard.<br> Yeah, that would be nice.<br> Look at this! My two best friends! Excuse me.<br> I don't mean to be a jerk but the baby with the rash came in after me.<br> The doctor will be right with you, sir.<br> Mommy, I can't find Waldo.<br> What, the circus? He's behind the elephant.<br> Wow.<br> So your child's a big fan of the Waldo books too? Yeah, that's how I know.<br> - I'm Ross, by the way.<br> - Hi, I'm Sally.<br> So no ring.<br> Can I assume you're also a single parent? - I am a single parent.<br> - It's hard, isn't it? There's no time for a social life.<br> Where are you gonna meet someone? Let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.<br> Rossie? We're ready for you.<br> Yeah Come on, Ross Jr.<br> It's time to go in.<br> Mommy.<br> Mommy, what's wrong with that man? Hey, I helped you find Waldo! - Good, you haven't left yet.<br> - Where have you been? I got held up at Dr.<br> Gettleman's office.<br> There was some guy that freaked everybody out.<br> You got here just in time.<br> I really have to go, buddy.<br> Oh, man.<br> - Promise to call me when you land? - Of course I will.<br> I love you.<br> I love you too.<br> Watch the tongue, people.<br> We got a baby over here.<br> - Bye, Chandler.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye, honey.<br> - Bye.<br> - What's the matter, Joe? - I'm mad at you for leaving.<br> You know, you're nothing but a big leaver.<br> A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.<br> Any chance you're trying to pick a fight to make all of this easier? Dude, you see right through me! Okay, well Bye, Mon.<br> Bye, Ross.<br> Rachel.<br> - Bye, Emma.<br> - Okay, bye-bye.<br> Have a good trip.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Wait.<br> It goes old job new job and you.<br> This is just something I have to do.<br> I know.<br> I love you so much.<br> I know that too.<br> Don't worry.<br> I'll be back before you know it.<br> Yes, it will be the same.<br> Because I know, that's how.<br> I promise.<br> You double promise? Call me when you land.<br> - Can I talk now? - Okay, bye.<br> - Joey! - He had to board.<br>   <br>
