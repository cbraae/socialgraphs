Calling from Rome! So he's calling from Rome.<br> I could do that.<br> Just gotta go to Rome.<br> Your Dad just beeped in.<br> Can you make it quick? I'm talking to Rome.<br> I'm talking to Rome.<br> Hey, Dad.<br> What's up? Oh, God.<br> Ross, it's Nana.<br> -How you doing? -Hey, Dad.<br> So how is she doing?

The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.<br> Yeah, they were gross.<br> You know what I love? Her Sweet 'N Lows.<br> How she was always stealing them from restaurants.<br> Not just from restaurants, from our house.<br> Mrs.<br> Geller? She looks so small.<br> I know.<br> Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phylis now.<br> Aunt Phylis is dead? Yeah, for like six years.<br> Where were? Can we focus, please? Goodbye, Nana.<br> Bye, Nana.<br> Nurse! What is going on? You know how the nurse said Nana had passed? Well, she's not quite.<br> What? She's not passed! She's present! She's back! What's going on? She may have died.<br> She may have died? We're looking into it.<br> I'll go see.<br> This almost never happens.<br> Now she's passed.<br> I just have to know, okay? Is it my hair? Yes, that's exactly what it is.<br> It's your hair.<br> Yeah, you have homosexual hair.<br> So did she? Twice.<br> -Twice? -Oh, that sucks.<br> -You guys okay? -I don't know.<br> It's weird.<br> I know she's gone, but I just don't feel.<br> Maybe she's not really gone.<br> No, no, she's gone.<br> We checked.<br> A lot.<br> No, I mean, maybe no one ever really goes.<br> Ever since my mom died, every now and then  I get this feeling that she's right here, you know? And Debbie, my friend from junior high got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course.<br> I always get this strong Debbie vibe when I use a little yellow pencil.<br> -I miss her.<br> -Here, Pheebs.<br> Want this? -Oh, thanks.<br> -Sure.<br> I just sharpened her this morning.<br> I don't believe any of that.<br> When you' re dead you' re dead.<br> You' re gone.<br> You' re worm food.<br> So Chandler looks gay, huh? I don't know who this is, but it's not Debbie.<br> Dad, let's just make a decision.<br> You're right.<br> It's going into the ground.<br> We should get the most basic thing.<br> "The non-protective corrugated fiberboard with white laminate.<br> " Dad, we can't bury Nana in a dresser from kea.<br> This is why your mother buys my clothes.<br> I hate to shop.<br> I hate it.<br> Isn't this more about the fact that once you decide, it's like acknowledging Nana's actually gone? No, I really hate to shop.<br> -I thought it'd be a closed casket.<br> -lt doesn't mean she can't look nice.<br> Sweetie, you think you can get in there? I don't see why not.<br> Here's my retainer.<br> I was just thinking -when my time comes -Dad.<br> Listen to me.<br> When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.<br> You what? I wanna be buried at sea.<br> It looks like fun.<br> Define "fun.<br> " Come on.<br> You'll make a day of it.<br> You'll get a boat, pack a lunch.<br> And then we throw your body in the water.<br> Gee, that does sound fun.<br> Everyone thinks they know me.<br> Everyone says I'm so predictable.<br> Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, " Buried at sea? Huh? " That's probably what they'll say.<br> I'd like that.<br> -Hey, gorgeous.<br> -Hey.<br> Look, l' m sorry about yesterday.<br> Don't worry.<br> Apparently, other people have made the same mistake.<br> Okay.<br> Phew! So, what do you think it is about me? I don't know what.<br> You just have -a quality.<br> -A quality.<br> Great.<br> It's a shame.<br> You and Lowell would've made a great couple.<br> Lowell? Financial Services Lowell? That's who you saw me with? What? He's cute.<br> Well, yeah.<br> He's no Brian in Payroll.<br> Is Brian? I don't know.<br> If you were gonna set me up  I'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him.<br> Brian's a little out of your league.<br> Excuse me.<br> You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian.<br> Believe you me.<br> I'm really not.<br> This one? I've shown you every dress we have.<br> Unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit go with the burgundy.<br> Whatever we pick, she'd say it's the wrong one.<br> Right.<br> We'll go with the burgundy.<br> A fine choice.<br> I'm coming out.<br> Wait! We need shoes.<br> -How about these? -That's really a day shoe.<br> Where she's going everyone else will be dressier? Could we see something in a slimmer heel? I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.<br> I can show you something silver that may work.<br> -No, it really should be burgundy.<br> -Unless we go with a different dress.<br> No, no, no.<br> Watch this.<br> Wait, I may have something in the back.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Is everything all right? Just Nana's stuff.<br> You guys ready? Mom called to tell me not to wear my hair up.<br> -Know my ears aren't my best feature? -Some days it's all I can think about.<br> I' m sorry l' m late.<br> I couldn't find my bearings.<br> You mean your earrings? What did I say? -Are these the shoes? -Yes.<br> Paolo sent them from ltaly.<br> What? We don't have shoes here? -Morning.<br> We ready to go? -Don't we look nice all dressed up? It's stuff like that, isn't it? -lt was a really beautiful service.<br> -lt really was.<br> Come here, sweetheart.<br> You know, I think it's time for you to start using night cream.<br> What? Nothing.<br> Just that your coat sounds like Brent Musberger.<br> -Check it out.<br> Giants-Cowboys.<br> -You're watching football at a funeral? No, it's the pre-game.<br> I' m gonna watch it at the reception.<br> You're a frightening, frightening man.<br> Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes! I hope they're not ruined.<br> God, what a great day! What? Weather-wise.<br> I know.<br> The air, the trees.<br> Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost life Ross, are you okay? No, l' m fine.<br> Just  having my worst fear realized, but.<br> I' m just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm.<br> -What? What is it? -You missed a belt loop.<br> Okay, it's in spasm.<br> Here, sweetie.<br> I took these when I had my gall thing accident.<br> Thanks, Mom.<br> Sorry.<br> Hi, l' m Andrea.<br> I'm Dorothy's daughter.<br> Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.<br> Look who's up! -How do you feel? -I feel great.<br> I feel great.<br> I feel great.<br> Wow, those pills really worked.<br> Yeah.<br> Not the first two, but the second two.<br> I love you guys.<br> You guys are the greatest.<br> I love my sister.<br> I love Pheebs.<br> That's so nice.<br> I love you, man.<br> And listen, if you wanna be gay, be gay! It doesn't matter to me.<br> You were right.<br> I do love you.<br> Oh, Ross.<br> I love you too.<br> Oh, no, I really love you.<br> I really love you.<br> Oh, you don't get it! -What do you got there? -Just a hearing disability.<br> What's the score? Three minutes to go in the third.<br> Beautiful! Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? Your grandmother would've hated this.<br> Sure.<br> What with it being her funeral and all.<br> No, I'd be hearing about why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham.<br> Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.<br> Or she'd say: "Why waste your money? I don't need flowers, l' m dead.<br> " That sounds like Nana.<br> Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say? I can imagine.<br> It's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person she is.<br> That is a wonder.<br> So tell me something, Mom.<br> If you had to do it all over again  I mean, if she was here right now would you tell her? T ell her what? How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail.<br> Like your hair, for example.<br> I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.<br> Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth? Some things are better left unsaid.<br> It's nicer when people just get along.<br> More wine? Oh, I think so.<br> Those earrings look really lovely on you.<br> Thank you.<br> They're yours.<br> Actually, they were Nana's.<br> Now l' m depressed! Even more than I was.<br> Oh, look.<br> My first grade picture.<br> Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T -shirt.<br> -Hey, who's this little naked guy? -That little naked guy would be me.<br> Look at the little thing! Yes, fine.<br> That is my penis.<br> Can we be grownups now? Who are those people? -Got me.<br> -That's Nana right there in the middle.<br> Yeah, let's see.<br> " Me and the gang at Java Joe's.<br> " You look just like your grandmother.<br> How old was she? Let's see, " 1 939.<br> " Twenty-four, twenty-five.<br> It looks like a fun gang.<br> Look, look, look! I got Monica naked! Let me see! No, no.<br> That would be me again.<br> I'm just trying something.<br> Hey, Lowell.<br> Oh, hey, Chandler.<br> So how's it going in Financial Services? It's like Mardi Gras without the papier-mache heads.<br> How about you? Good.<br> Good.<br> Listen I don't know what Shelly told you about me, but  I' m not.<br> I know.<br> That's what I told her.<br> Really? So you can tell? Pretty much.<br> Most of the time.<br> We have a kind of radar.<br> So you don't think I have a quality? Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no.<br> By the way, your friend Brian, from Payroll? He is.<br> -He is? -And way out of your league.<br> Out of my league! I could get a Brian.<br> If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.<br> Hey, Brian.<br>   <br>
