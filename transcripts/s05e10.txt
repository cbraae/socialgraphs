                    			-What are you doing? -I reorganized the fridge.<br> See? Bottom shelf, meats and dairy.<br> Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.<br> And top shelf, expired products.<br> Why are you doing this? Because I'm bored out of my mind.<br> I've already been to the bank, post office and dry cleaners.<br> Dude, you just described seven days' worth of stuff.<br> Spread it out a little.<br> Haven't you ever been unemployed? I'm not unemployed.<br> I'm on sabbatical.<br> Hey, don't get religious on me, okay? A guy in your position needs to be better at relaxing.<br> That's why we have comfortable chairs.<br> Here, sit down.<br> Ready? Watch.<br> And then.<br> -So, what? We just sit? -Oh, no, no.<br> We're not gonna just sit.<br> Watch.<br> -Hello, Chandler Bing.<br> -Hello, Mr.<br> Bing.<br> I love you.<br> All right, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been 6 months! It's not funny! I can see you, Mr.<br> Bing.<br> You look sexy in your new suit.<br> Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone! And that's Wednesday.<br> The One with The lnappropriate Sister Hey, you guys! Guess what? The British are coming? Oh, you and your ways.<br> Since it's Christmas, I'm going to be collecting donations.<br> I have my bell and later on I get my bucket.<br> I'll be spreading joy to the people.<br> Last year I spread a little joy, but not enough.<br> So this year I'm doing the whole city.<br> I knew a girl in high school who did that.<br> She was very popular.<br> It's weird, you're starting to sound a lot like Chandler lately.<br> That is so not true.<br> So, Phoebe, where are you doing your bell-ringing? They gave me a great spot right by Macy's.<br> They never give a good spot to a rookie but I'm the only one who can say "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.<br> I lied! Oh, my God.<br> Here's Danny.<br> Just watch this.<br> See? Still pretending he's not interested.<br> He's coming over.<br> Pretend we've forgotten who he is.<br> -Hey, guys.<br> -Hey, Danny.<br> Oh, Danny! Hey! You know Rachel.<br> She's nice.<br> She's not bad to look at, right? Thanks, Mon.<br> Of course.<br> Do you want to go out on a date with her? Absolutely.<br> Is Friday okay? Friday is perfect.<br> She can't wait.<br> On the date, I'll be able to talk to her directly? See you Friday.<br> Okay, what the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me.<br> I have a date with Danny! All right, it's 4:30, I guess my lunch break is over.<br> -What are you guys gonna do? -lf you're going back to work I'll probably just hang out.<br> You know, make some calls.<br> How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old ltalian actor from Queens! Well, Talia Shire suddenly became available.<br> She's a woman! What can I say? She nailed it! Is there anything else? You'll just say no again, but gay porn? Happy holidays! Feliz Navidad! Allo and Merry Christmas! Oh, thank you, sir! Here's some joy.<br> -How's it going? -It's going okay.<br> Good.<br> Let me help you out.<br> Oh, thanks! Is that a new suede jacket? It looks really expensive.<br> Yeah.<br> I guess.<br> Just get your nails done? Yes, Phoebe, but this is all I have, okay? Thanks.<br> Happy holidays! Here's your joy.<br> Thank you! Happy holidays and Wait.<br> -You can't take money out.<br> -I'm making change for the bus.<br> Can't you leave the dollar for the poor? I'm poor.<br> I gotta take the bus.<br> Okay, season's greetings and everything, but still Bite me, blondie! I'm going to give him something besides joy.<br> Just I can't believe I didn't get that part.<br> I'm sorry, man.<br> What you should do is make something happen for yourself.<br> You know, like write a play.<br> Or a movie.<br> What about those Good Will Hunting guys? Be realistic, you know? If I did write something what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it? Wait a second.<br> I could star in it! Or that.<br> I can't write.<br> I mean, I'm an actor.<br> I could act like a writer.<br> Here.<br> But see? Nada.<br> I don't have the discipline that it takes.<br> I can't do it.<br> I'll help you.<br> Yeah.<br> I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.<br> Plus, it'll give me something to do.<br> You'd do that for me? Thanks.<br> We'll start slow.<br> All you have to come up with tonight is the name of your main character.<br> -Done.<br> -And it can't be Joey.<br> -It's not.<br> -Or Joseph.<br> What's up? I just saw Danny on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.<br> Honey, I'm sorry.<br> You should be.<br> This is all your fault.<br> You meddled in our relationship! You had no relationship! But I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan! Oh, God, stop with the plan! So what if you saw him with a girl? That doesn't mean anything.<br> You'll go out with Danny and be so charming he'll forget all about that stupid subway girl.<br> She was kind of stupid.<br> You're right.<br> I'm just going to go on the date.<br> I'm just going to go on the date.<br> That is the new plan.<br> Hurry! -How do you spell "suspicious"? -Why? I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.<br> Chandler Bing, seven! Chandler Bing, zero! You're driving me crazy with that.<br> -I'll stop.<br> -Don't stop.<br> Move the bowl further away.<br> Ross could make that shot.<br> Well, you suck.<br> But at least you suck at a man's game now.<br> -Want to play? -I can't play games.<br> Ross'll be home soon.<br> I have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.<br> So play for 30 minutes, then write until he gets home.<br> All right.<br> But listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch? I'm intrigued.<br> All right.<br> All we need is a little lighter fluid.<br> But be careful.<br> I want our security deposit back.<br> We said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.<br> Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle? Thank you! Happy holiday.<br> No, that's trash, young lady.<br> You can't Stop that young lady! She donated trash! The charity's on fire! Help! Thank you.<br> I need that! What is this? It's 9:00 in the morning! All right.<br> "A room.<br> A man enters.<br> He looks suspicious.<br>" That's it? You're supposed to have five pages done by now including an exciting incident.<br> What is all this? "The Official Rulebook of Fireball.<br>" That's the game we played.<br> It's great.<br> You take a tennis ball, a bowl and lighter This is helping your career? You wanted to be an actor.<br> Not the creator of "Crazy Lawsuit Game.<br>" You're right.<br> I'll get back to work.<br> Shame on you! You should know better! Joey needs to work.<br> Now come on.<br> You can have this back when the five pages are done.<br> -I had a nice time tonight.<br> -So did l.<br> I'm really glad Monica asked us out.<br> I'd love to ask you in, but my sister's visiting.<br> -I think she's asleep on the couch.<br> -Your sister? Your sister's asleep on the couch? I saw you with her on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch! -I thought I heard you.<br> -Hey, great, you're up.<br> Rachel, my sister Krista.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> I wish you'd warned me.<br> I'd have fixed myself up.<br> -Like it would help.<br> -You are so bad.<br> -You are.<br> -You are.<br> -You are.<br> -You are! You are so dead.<br> I'm gonna get you.<br> Come here! It's very nice to meet you.<br> Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Does this look like a garbage can to you? Does it look like an ashtray? Does it look like a urinal? -So you going back out there? -Yeah, but I won't take any more crap.<br> No more Mrs.<br> Nice Bucket.<br> Good.<br> You're tough.<br> You lived on the street.<br> I'll go back to being Street Phoebe.<br> But not totally back.<br> Street Phoebe wouldn't be friends with you guys.<br> Can I ask you guys something? I don't have brothers, so I don't know, but did you guys wrestle? -Oh, yeah.<br> -All the time.<br> In fact, I was undefeated.<br> Well, you weighed 200 pounds.<br> Still, I was quick as a cat.<br> I met Danny's sister yesterday.<br> -That was the girl on the subway.<br> -You're kidding.<br> They were very, you know wrestle-y.<br> But I guess that's normal? We don't wrestle now.<br> Not since I got too strong for you.<br> Too strong for me? You wanna go right now? I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go? Oh, fine.<br> Ready? Wrestle! Okay, you know what? Actually, that helps a lot.<br> Thanks.<br> Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Joey's not going.<br> I didn't finish my five pages.<br> Finish them tomorrow.<br> Tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.<br> Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.<br> Cut him some slack.<br> If he relaxes, he'll get some work done.<br> I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.<br> If you think Fireball's relaxing, you've never played.<br> You're doing this because you're bored.<br> It's not his fault you're unemployed.<br> I am not unemployed.<br> I'm on sabbatical! Guys, don't fight.<br> And I'm doing this because I am Joey's friend.<br> If you were a friend, you'd be doing the same.<br> So being a friend means being a jerk? If it does, then you're an amazing friend of mine.<br> Let's settle this over a game of Fireball.<br> -I'll unhook the smoke detectors.<br> -Let's settle this right now.<br> There.<br> Now no one's going to the game.<br> -I paid for those! -You said you would, but you didn't.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> We finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera.<br> The same thing happened to me one time.<br> When did that happen to you? Remember? We were jogging and saw that bird.<br> I wanted to take a picture, but I didn't have my camera.<br> Chasing the churro guy is not jogging.<br> Oh, this is so good.<br> You have got to try it.<br> -Damn.<br> I got it on my pants.<br> -Here, I'll get it.<br> We better take them off or the stain will set.<br> -I want to wear them tonight.<br> -Oh, great.<br> Okay, bye.<br> Oh, my God! -That was unbelievable.<br> -See? I told you.<br> Yeah.<br> Sorry.<br> I don't believe they're brother and sister.<br> They're brother and sister?! I guess you'll have to cancel your date.<br> And call their mother.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Open your hand.<br> Let me take a look.<br> Quarter, dime.<br> Lint? Not interested in that.<br> What's this? A Canadian coin? Get out of here! No drinks near the bucket.<br> Set it down there and then you can make a contribution.<br> You can leave the "hurt bunny" look over there too.<br> Hi, Bob.<br> I thought I told you to get out of here! Phoebe, we've been getting complaints.<br> We're moving you to a less high-profile spot.<br> -Ginger's taking this corner.<br> -That chick can't handle my corner.<br> Look, either you leave or we remove you.<br> Fine.<br> I'll give you one pointer.<br> Look out for that bitch.<br> -I thought we said 7.<br> -You know what? Let's skip it.<br> What? Why? You and your sister seem to have a very special bond Oh, great.<br> That "special bond" again.<br> Why do women have a problem with my being close to my sister? -I don't know, but -Do you have brothers? No, I have two sisters.<br> But one has a very masculine energy.<br> -Are you close? -No.<br> They're not very nice people.<br> I like you.<br> I think this could go somewhere.<br> So I'm close to my family.<br> Don't let it stand in our way.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> When you put it that way Danny? Hurry up.<br> The bath's getting cold.<br> I'll see you later.<br> There's some kids playing in the street.<br> Want to go give them a project, ruin their day? If they have a ball, you could stick razors in it and teach them a new game: "Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball.<br>" Hey, guys! I was at the library.<br> I already finished my five pages.<br> Now we can go to the Ranger game last night! No, dude.<br> Ross tore up the tickets.<br> I guess without so many distractions it's easier for you to focus? Also without somebody breathing down your neck all the livelong day! The important thing is, I finished it.<br> And I think it's really good.<br> But it would help if I could hear it.<br> Would you guys read it for me? -Yeah, all right.<br> -All right.<br> "It's a typical New York apartment.<br> Two guys are hanging out.<br>" "Hey, man.<br>" "What is up?" "About yesterday.<br> I was really wrong.<br> I am sorry.<br>" "No, it was me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I overreacted.<br>" "Maybe it was both of us.<br> But we had our best friend's inter But we had our best friend's interest at heart.<br>" "Could I be more sorry?" "l don't know.<br> I am one sorry polontologist.<br>" All right, Joey, we get it.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> -I'm sorry too.<br> Keep reading.<br> The good part's coming up.<br> "l am sorry, Chandler.<br>" "l am sorry, Ross.<br>" "A handsome man enters.<br>" "l don't know what you're talking about, but I'd like to thank you both.<br> You.<br> You wouldn't let me give up on myself.<br> And you.<br> You co-created Fireball.<br>" "The End.<br>" This took you all day? No, this took five minutes.<br> I spent the rest of the day coming up with new Ultimate Fireball! It's a typical New York apartment.<br> Two girls are just hanging out.<br> Go.<br> -"Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?" -"I'm doing just fine.<br> God, Tiffany, you smell so great.<br>" "It's my new perfume.<br> Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?" -Joey, you are sick.<br> -This is disgusting.<br> I'm not reading this.<br> Wait, wait, wait! The handsome man was about to enter!   <br>
