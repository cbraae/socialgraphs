                    			Monica? Hey, can I borrow the Porsche? - Okay.<br> - All right! But what is it not? A place to entertain my lady friends.<br> - And what else is it not? - A place to eat spaghetti.<br> Very good.<br> What do you need it for anyway? The Powerball lottery is up to 300 million and they don't sell tickets here.<br> - So you're driving up to Connecticut? Yeah, Connecticut.<br> Not West Virginia.<br> Maybe I'll drive you up there.<br> I'd like to buy some tickets myself.<br> Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use $300 million.<br> Yes, because if I was at my old job, we'd say, "300 million? No, thank you.<br>" - Will you get me tickets too? - Yeah, me too.<br> - Sure.<br> - I have an idea.<br> Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it.<br> - That's a great idea! No, thanks.<br> - You don't want to win the lottery? - Sure I do.<br> I also want to be king of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.<br> - Still on Amelia Earhart? - The woman just vanished! Seriously, you don't want in on this? No.<br> Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I mean, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.<br> But there's six of us, so we'd only have to get struck 7 times.<br> I like those odds! Seriously, you guys, I can't believe you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.<br> I mean, that's such a bunch of boo-hockey.<br> I'll ask.<br> "Boo-hockey"? Oh, we think Emma's about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.<br> So get ready to hear a lot of boo-hockey gosh darn it and brother pucker.<br> How do you know she's gonna start talking? When I talk to her, I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.<br> Kind of like Joey.<br> What's that now? The One With the Lottery mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 God, look at all these tickets.<br> It's so exciting.<br> I haven't won anything since sixth grade.<br> Pie-eating contest? You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something? No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.<br> - That was a good day.<br> - Yeah.<br> - They're towing your car! - I'm parked in a garage on Morton.<br> They're towing a car.<br> And I am seeing spots.<br> Ross, you don't have Emma! Rachel, you don't have Emma! - Where's Emma? Who has Emma? - Joey, relax.<br> My mother picked her up two hours ago.<br> You were there.<br> - I was? - Yes, and you talked to her.<br> - I did? - She dropped off a casserole.<br> Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.<br> Did you come by to watch us win the big bucks? Yeah.<br> And then I figured after you win, we can all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it.<br> Don't touch the phone! I'll get it! - You think he washed his hands? - Hello? - Hey, Charlie, what do you know? - What's going on? Chandler's supposed to find out if he's getting a job at his agency.<br> But out of 15 interns, they're only hiring three.<br> - Tough odds.<br> - Yeah.<br> If only it were a sure thing like your 24-state lottery.<br> Yeah, look who's coming around! Damn it.<br> All right, call me when you know more.<br> - Did you get it? - One of the slots got filled.<br> - By you? - Sense the tone.<br> - No, that kid Nate got it.<br> - Oh, I hate that guy.<br> I mean, come on, kid, pull up your pants! Well, there's two spots left, right? Yeah.<br> I mean, I want this so much.<br> I want to get one.<br> I want my friend Charlie to get one.<br> Except I don't care about Charlie.<br> - Hey, you guys.<br> - Hey! You are not gonna believe this.<br> I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight! I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.<br> A psychic and a wishbone? Guys, give someone else a chance.<br> - All right, who wants to do it? - Can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.<br> It's really not fair.<br> Just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses.<br> All right.<br> Rach? I don't want that turkey smell all over my hands.<br> I'll do it! Lt'll get the casserole stink off of mine.<br> - I hope I win.<br> - Well, it doesn't really matter.<br> You're both wishing for the same thing.<br> I can't tell you what I'm wishing for, or else, you know, it won't come true.<br> Right.<br> But we know what you're wishing for.<br> - I can't really say.<br> - I understand.<br> But you're wishing for what we think, aren't you? I'm not really comfortable with these questions! - Please! - Just do it! Okay.<br> One, two, three.<br> I won! Hey! You know what? I'm sure your wish is gonna come true.<br> But, you guys, just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp.<br> That thing gets hot! Ross, just keep making your jokes.<br> How are you gonna feel if we actually do win? - You're not gonna win.<br> - I know the odds are against us but somebody has to win, and it could be us.<br> And then how you gonna feel? We're gonna be like, "Everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the Cape.<br>" And you're gonna be all, like, "Oh, I can't, guys.<br> I'll have to meet you up there.<br> I gotta gas up the Hyundai.<br>" Okay, I've heard myself on tape, and I sound nothing like that.<br> I can see the headline now: "Lottery Winners' Friend Filled With Regret, Eats Own Arm.<br>" Why would I eat my own arm? Well, you wouldn't, but we own the paper.<br> We can print whatever we want.<br> You know what? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.<br> - Why? - Because I know that you think that the lottery is boo-hockey but we're all here, and we're gonna watch the numbers and have fun.<br> And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.<br> You don't have to do that.<br> I mean, I'll pay for myself.<br> But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.<br> Come here.<br> Get a room.<br> So now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win? - I don't know.<br> I'll probably just invest it.<br> - Calm down.<br> Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Did I say, "invest it"? I meant, "Be cool and piss it all away.<br>" I know! We should pool all our money and buy the Knicks! I don't really care about the Knicks.<br> You will when I pick you as starting forward.<br> You would do that? I never get picked! I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.<br> You won't let me buy the Knicks? I can't believe you're taking this away.<br> You're right, it has been your dream for over 15 seconds.<br> How long until they announce the numbers, Mommy? I'll take this one too.<br> "Mommy"? Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma.<br> Which I now realize we are not.<br> I'm hoping that if she hears it enough, it'll be her first word.<br> Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.<br> I like that, Daddy.<br> I was just talking about Rachel.<br> Is Daddy getting angry? Is Daddy gonna spank me? Well, that depends.<br> Have you been a bad? No, I can't.<br> Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie.<br> Did anybody else hear? What? Susan got it? How? Oh, man, I would've slept with him! All right, bye.<br> Dude, I'm sorry.<br> But hey, there's one spot left, right? - Well, Charlie's gonna get that.<br> - Hey, don't say that.<br> You've got just as good a chance of getting that job.<br> He is the boss' son.<br> - Come on, lottery! - Yeah! - It starts in, like, 20 minutes.<br> - Okay, here we go.<br> We need to sort through the tickets quickly to see if we've won.<br> So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Okay, how about this: We divide them into six groups of 40.<br> The remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes first.<br> - I have another idea.<br> - I'm sorry, idea time is over.<br> - Well, are all the tickets in the bowl? - Yeah.<br> - What about the ones on the nightstand? - There are no tickets there.<br> Yes, there are.<br> I just saw them a few minutes ago.<br> No, you didn't.<br> You must be mistaken.<br> - There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.<br> - Chandler, sense the tone.<br> Well, well, well.<br> Look what Mommy found.<br> Okay, fine.<br> I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.<br> The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.<br> I can't believe this.<br> I thought we were all in this together.<br> - Hey, you just got in five minutes ago! - Three minutes ago! I don't know why that's important.<br> I was with you the whole time.<br> When did you even get those? When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic.<br> I'll show you how.<br> Okay.<br> Well, Monica, suppose one of your special tickets wins? How are you gonna feel when you win and lose your friends? Please.<br> If I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me.<br> Someone gave me muffins last week, and I couldn't get rid of you for three days! Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong? She's right.<br> You shouldn't have bought tickets just for us.<br> Let me finish.<br> However, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles.<br> So screw you! The tickets are ours! There's the man I married.<br> All right.<br> Believe me, if you win the lottery it's the last you're gonna hear from us.<br> Fine.<br> Don't be my friends.<br> I'll buy new friends.<br> Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they look just like you! You know what? I want my share of the tickets.<br> I want my tickets too! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graf! Cool.<br> Then I want mine too! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond! No.<br> You guys, we gotta keep all the tickets together.<br> No.<br> No, we should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my car! Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! - This whole thing was my idea! - Yeah.<br> Thanks for inventing the lottery! Just give them to me, and I'll split them up! Hey, hey! God, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! - Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets! - Wait, no, no! Hey! If we're not doing this together, we're not doing it at all.<br> - Say goodbye to your tickets.<br> - No! No! No! Do not come any closer! Can I come a little bit closer? Valuable things are getting squished.<br> Now, what's more important, your friends or money? - Friends! - Money! Friends.<br> Hey, Monica, what about your extra tickets? They're all in there.<br> - Even these five that I hid in my bra.<br> - Monica! Okay.<br> Good.<br> You guys were so scared.<br> There is no way I was gonna dump this God! No! I think I broke your bowl.<br> Go! Go! Go! What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets.<br> And the wind sure made it fun.<br> - Phoebe, we lost half of them.<br> - So what? Monica, we have the winning ticket.<br> My psychic said I was gonna win, remember? Weird your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon.<br> As a matter of fact, she said that's how I'm going to die.<br> So excuse me for being a little skittish.<br> There's two messages.<br> This could be from work.<br> - Oh, play them.<br> - Okay.<br> Here we go.<br> Hello.<br> This is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologize.<br> I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand.<br> It was all my fault.<br> Not hers.<br> Bye.<br> Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.<br> "Hey", "Chandler", "it's Charlie.<br>" This is it.<br> "Listen", "it turns" out I got the last spot.<br> "I'm really sorry", "man.<br>" It was a lot of fun working with you.<br> Give me a call if you want.<br> Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.<br> Sorry, Chandler.<br> It is so unfair.<br> It's like that time they promoted Saundra over me at work.<br> Was she related to Ralph Lauren? No, she was just much better at her job than me.<br> You guys, the drawing's about to start.<br> We should call my mom's and say good night to Emma before she goes down.<br> - Good idea.<br> Honey, you're being really strong about this.<br> I know how badly you wanted that job.<br> Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.<br> But let's go win the lottery.<br> I mean, we still have a 130 chances to win, right? Hundred and thirty-one.<br> Yeah, good night, sweetheart.<br> I love you.<br> And remember, you're Daddy's little girl.<br> Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.<br> Hi, Mom.<br> Put her back on.<br> Rach, they're announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.<br> Here are your official Powerball numbers.<br> We have 53.<br> - I've got that.<br> - We have one too! We are on the road, people! Come on! Mom, please, I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you.<br> Would you please just let me say good night to my daughter? And here we go.<br> The Powerball is seven.<br> All right, check your numbers! Make me rich.<br> You guys, you're not gonna believe this.<br> I was just saying good night to Emma, and she said her first words.<br> - What? - Well, what did she say? She said, "Gleba"! Make me rich! - Isn't that amazing? - Oh, yeah.<br> No, no, no, that's great.<br> Why aren't you more excited? Rach, gleba is not a word.<br> - Well, of course it is.<br> - Okay.<br> What does it mean? Well, I don't know all the words.<br> You know, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first word.<br> - Yes you did! Gleba is a word! - Okay.<br> Use it in a sentence.<br> Okay.<br> Emma just said, "Gleba.<br>" - It's not a word.<br> - Okay, fine.<br> I'm gonna look it up.<br> Okay, great.<br> While you're at it, she said another word the other day.<br> Why don't you look up: All right.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Gleba.<br> Gleba.<br> Gleba.<br> Gleba! Here it is! "The fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.<br>" She's gonna be a scientist.<br> - Damn it.<br> Anybody got anything? - No.<br> I'm still looking through mine.<br> Just double-checking.<br> No.<br> No.<br> No.<br> No! Hello? Hold on.<br> It's your boss.<br> The "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call.<br> I'm not used to getting these from guys.<br> - Hey, Steve.<br> - Chandler, hi.<br> I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions.<br> We felt that with your maturity and experience you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.<br> I'd love to be somebody's assistant.<br> Answering phones getting coffee, I live for that stuff.<br> And I'm not too mature.<br> Farts, boobies, butt cracks! Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.<br> We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.<br> Me? That guy who just said, "butt cracks"? "Yes", "that's right.<br>" We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.<br> Okay.<br> Well, thanks, you won't regret it.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter! Congratulations! Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.<br> Thanks.<br> Does that mean I get the good loving tonight? You bet.<br> No TV or anything.<br> - Hey, that is so great about the job.<br> - Thanks, man.<br> I'd like to think I had something to do with it.<br> - Really? Why? - Well, before with the wishbone.<br> I didn't wish we would win the lottery.<br> I wished you'd get the job.<br> Oh, yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica.<br> She'll rip your heart right out.<br> Well, you know what? There was a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.<br> Me too.<br> So much for my dinosaur/ Amelia Earhart theme park.<br> You guys? What was the Powerball number again? - Seven.<br> - We won.<br> - What? - We won! - Let me see! Let me see! - Don't tear it! Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers! I know that, but look, we got the Powerball number.<br> We won $3! Wow, you think we should get that over I don't care.<br> I've never won anything before.<br> I can't believe this! So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do with your $3? Well, it's not all mine.<br> We all get 50 cents.<br> You know what? You can have mine.<br> - Me too.<br> - Me too.<br> Me too.<br> Well, I guess if everybody else is.<br> Hey, guys.<br> So I just called the Powerball hot line.<br> - Can you believe it? Nobody won.<br> - I beg to differ.<br> Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier and he found a ticket on the street right outside and won $ 10,000.<br> Again, don't blame the pretty lady.<br> It was not her fault.<br> It was me, the pigeon.<br> Seriously, stop staring at her.<br>   <br>
