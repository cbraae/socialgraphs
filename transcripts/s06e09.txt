                    			Okay, great.<br> Bye.<br> Guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner? Sidney Poitier? I miss Rachel.<br> My parents.<br> Great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in.<br> If you could not mention that we live together, that'd be great.<br> I was thinking we'd eat around 4.<br> Why can't I tell them we live together? They don't know we're dating.<br> Should we eat in the kitchen? Why haven't you told them? Well, I was going to.<br> I really was.<br> But then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.<br> Why not? Wouldn't they be happy? So, dinner in the kitchen around 4.<br> I'll see you then.<br> Why wouldn't they be happy? Well, because.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>mainly.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they don't like you.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> -What? Why? Why? Maybe because you used to be aloof.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or that you're sarcastic or that you joke around.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or that you throw your clothes on the couch.<br> Is this why they don't like me or you don't like me? I know I should have told them.<br> I shouldn't care what they think.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It'll be okay because when they come over, I will be charming.<br> I will make them love me, then we'll tell them.<br> Will that work? I can be pretty charming, babe.<br> I won you over, didn't l? I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk.<br> The One Where Ross Got High Gelula/SDI Hey.<br> Oh, good, Ross.<br> Your parents like me, right? Yes, of course they like you.<br> Monica told me they don't.<br> Yeah, they don't like you.<br> Do you know why? Maybe it's because you're sarcastic or maybe it's because you-- If people don't know, they shouldn't just guess! Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.<br> Maybe I give thanks for you shutting up, huh? Maybe I give thanks by taking my PlayStation to my place.<br> Maybe I love you.<br> Hey, guys.<br> No, I don't want to play video games, Joey! Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving? Yeah, why? Me and my friends are doing Thanksgiving uptown.<br> I thought you might like to come.<br> For real? You should go to Chandler's.<br> None of us can cook.<br> We'll just drink all day.<br> We go to yours! We have to stop across the hall because it's my sister.<br> But, you know, actually, growing up with a sister was nice.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because it helped me understand women.<br> Yeah, you should tell your friends that.<br> Okay.<br> How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.<br> Pheebs, check it out! For my dessert.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm making a traditional English trifle.<br> Wow.<br> That sounds great! And what are you making, Monica? In case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and there's none left for anybody else! Nothing.<br> Nothing? No, sweetie.<br> I trust you.<br> If I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert? You won't mess it up.<br> I love that.<br> You really have faith in me.<br> Thank you.<br> Question: How do you know when the butter is done? It's done about two minutes before it looks like that.<br> -The food smells great, Mon.<br> -And the place looks so nice.<br> -Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody! -Happy Thanksgiving! -Well, this has been great.<br> -See you.<br> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where you going? We did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.<br> Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl? Some would say she's attractive, yes.<br> Who else is going to be there? Her friends.<br> Her dancer friends? Yes! All right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and they'll be drinking and dancing and we really want to go! Dude, we were good.<br> You're not going.<br> You said you'd eat here and you'll eat here.<br> Yeah, and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is not very Thanksgiving-y.<br> Oh, but it is.<br> It's like the first Thanksgiving when the lndians and Pilgrims sat down.<br> Then the lndians taught the Pilgrims.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>what it meant to be hot in the New World! -Hello, everybody! -Hi! Hi, Dad.<br> Mom.<br> Look! Look who it is! It's Chandler! Oh, yes, of course.<br> Hello, Chandler.<br> Mr.<br> and Mrs.<br> Geller, you look wonderful.<br> It is great to have you here.<br> Let us take your coats.<br> Whoa, it snowing out there? No.<br> Monica, all this food looks wonderful.<br> You should do this for a living.<br> Okay, I have dandruff.<br> There's no need to laugh and point.<br> Chandler was laughing at your joke.<br> My joke wasn't funny.<br> Rach, I just remembered.<br> I had a dream about Mr.<br> Geller last night.<br> Really? I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and he was so brave and so strong.<br> And it's making me look at him totally differently.<br> He used to be just "Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad.<br> " Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk.<br> " I don't know.<br> To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>walks in while you're changing.<br> " You know, Dad, Chandler is one of Ross' very best friends.<br> Ross sure is a great guy.<br> I've always felt that how a man turns out.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is a reflection on his father.<br> I always thought that too.<br> Tell me, what does your father do? He's a headliner of a.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>gay burlesque show.<br> You're killing us.<br> Will you serve the dessert already? There's drunken dancers a-waiting! Look at it.<br> Isn't it beautiful? Yeah.<br> What is it? It's a trifle.<br> It's got all these layers.<br> First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then jam.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then custard, which I made from scratch.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then raspberries, more ladyfingers.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then beef sautÃ©ed with peas and onions.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then a little bit more custard.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then bananas and then I put whipped cream on top.<br> What was the one right before bananas? The beef.<br> Yeah, that was weird to me too.<br> But then I thought, "Well, there's minced meat pie.<br> " That's an English dessert.<br> These people just put strange things in their food.<br> Can I borrow rum from your place? Yeah, sure.<br> While I'm gone, don't you sneak a taste.<br> Beef in a dessert? No, no, no.<br> There is no way.<br> I know.<br> And only one layer of jam? What is up with that? Oh, my God.<br> The pages are stuck together.<br> Chandler! Oh, my God.<br> She made half an English trifle and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>half a shepherd's pie! Man, now she's gonna start all over.<br> We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the New World.<br> No, no, we will.<br> We just won't tell her she messed up.<br> Just let her serve the beef-custard thing? Yeah.<br> It'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story.<br> Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.<br> Joey.<br> God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees.<br> Did it make you want to walk around in your underwear? No.<br> Still not hot enough! Rachel.<br> Okay, look at him.<br> Look at those strong hands.<br> Oh, what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.<br> Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.<br> Thank you.<br> I just bought it.<br> Yes, well, it's very beautiful and it's cream-colored and tight and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I don't mean tight.<br> It's not tight.<br> Not that I was looking at.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> What's the matter with him? I think he's stoned again.<br> What? I need to talk to you.<br> I think I might know why my parents don't like you.<br> Why? Okay, remember we were young.<br> Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and my parents walked in and smelled it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.<br> Why did you do that? I don't know.<br> Yours was the first name that popped into my head.<br> I didn't think it'd matter.<br> How could it not matter? How was I to know we'd be friends after college.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you'd be living with my sister? What about all that "friends forever" stuff? I don't know.<br> I was all high.<br> Mom and Dad sent me to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned.<br> Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me! I can't believe you! We haven't told them we're together because they hate me, so fix this.<br> Okay, okay, I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high.<br> Now, who should I say it was? You! It's not like it's a big deal.<br> You don't still do it or anything.<br> All right.<br> Now, who should I say tricked me into doing it? Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here.<br> And if you're gonna put your feet up-- Leave him alone! Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me when I told you that Janine's friends are dancers? And that they're gonna be drinking a lot? No, I did.<br> But tell me again because it's so romantic.<br> You're whipping so slow.<br> Do it faster! I don't want to make any mistakes! If I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like: "Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?" Just let me worry about making it, and you just worry about eating it.<br> Oh, I am.<br> -If you don't tell them, then I will.<br> -Okay.<br> Fine.<br> Ross, can I talk to you for a second? Can it wait? I have to tell my parents something.<br> No, it can't? Okay.<br> We have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.<br> What? What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Truth Day! Look, when everyone eats that banana-meat thing.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they'll all make fun of her.<br> Do you want that? We'll just get everyone to act like they like it.<br> That way, no one makes fun of her.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and we still get to go to sweet potato pie.<br> Dude, they're not objects.<br> Just kidding.<br> I'll talk to them.<br> You distract her.<br> Hey, Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec? Okay.<br> What's up, Ross? So.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Thanksgiving.<br> The holiday season is upon us.<br> And.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you look nice today.<br> -Oh, no.<br> No, Ross, don't do this.<br> -What? I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.<br> I thought this might happen today.<br> I know the holidays can be rough.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it's probably hard for you to be alone right now.<br> You're alone.<br> No, I live with Phoebe.<br> I mean, you're alone-alone.<br> And it's just not the time for us.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Oh, well.<br> Can't blame a guy for trying.<br> And if anyone needs help pretending to like it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I learned some things in acting class.<br> Try rubbing your stomach.<br> Or saying "Mmm.<br> " Smiling.<br> I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.<br> Rachel, there you are.<br> Let's serve that dessert already! Joey, you have to stop rushing me.<br> You don't get any dessert.<br> Really? No, just kidding.<br> I would never do that to you.<br> Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.<br> So, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it? -It sure is.<br> -Wow.<br> So did you make it with beef or eggplant? -Beef.<br> -I can't have any.<br> I don't eat meat.<br> Monica, I want you to have the first taste.<br> Really? Wait, you only got whipped cream.<br> You gotta take a bite with all the layers.<br> You dropped a pea.<br> Well? It's good.<br> Really? How good? It's so good that I feel selfish.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>about being the only one who's eating it.<br> I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.<br> Especially Ross.<br> This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony.<br> So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.<br> I've gotta call my friend.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and tell her how good this is from Monica's room.<br> I'll help dial.<br> I'm gonna go into the bathroom.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it.<br> What was that all about? Does it not taste good? -Let me try it.<br> -No, no! All gone! So good.<br> Maybe Chandler has some left.<br> It tastes like feet.<br> I like it! Are you kidding? What's not to like? Custard, good.<br> Jam, good.<br> Meat, good.<br> So a bird just grabbed it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then tried to fly away with it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then just dropped it on the street? If it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he seemed to enjoy it.<br> Rachel, come here.<br> I was taking my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream.<br> -Do I want to hear this? -I don't know, let's see.<br> I dreamt we were getting married.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and he left because he had to go fight a fire.<br> So I went to a nightclub and I saw him making out with a girl.<br> Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you! But then Jacques Cousteau came.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and he kicked his ass for betraying me.<br> So cool! Then he took me diving and introduced me to his sea horse.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who was coming on to me.<br> Please, that is not gonna happen.<br> Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.<br> Five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me.<br> But now, nothing.<br> Well, not nothing.<br> I am still a woman.<br> Ross? Let's go.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> About telling Mom and Dad.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.<br> That's it.<br> You've had your chance.<br> Mom, Dad.<br> Ross smoked pot in college.<br> You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you remember that time you walked in my room.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and smelled marijuana? Yes.<br> I told you it was Chandler.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who was smoking the pot but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it was me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It was you? Dad, you know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys.<br> Ross did.<br> Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing.<br> Monica did! Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year! Monica and Chandler are living together! Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again! I love Jacques Cousteau! I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle! I want to go! That's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds.<br> All right.<br> Joey, if you want to leave, just leave.<br> Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.<br> It did not taste good.<br> Phoebe, I'm sorry.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.<br> Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that you're in an important relationship is beyond me.<br> And we kind of figured about the porch swing.<br> Ross.<br> Drugs? Divorced again? What happened, son? I got tricked into all those things.<br> Chandler, you've been Ross' best friend all these years.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>stuck by him during the drug problems.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and now you've taken on Monica as well.<br> Well, I don't know what to say.<br> You're a wonderful human being.<br> -Thank you! -No.<br> Thank you! Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you.<br> I'll talk to them.<br> You guys, it was bananas.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>cream and beef! I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad.<br> Well, actually, I didn't eat mine.<br> It's still in the bathroom.<br> No, I ate that.<br> And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.<br> Nope, got it and got yours too.<br>   <br>
