I got the lead! You got the lead in a movie? What's it about? It's called Shutterspeed.<br> It's really cool.<br> I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in, like, a day.<br> And then she disappears.<br> But I find out where she lives.<br> This old lady answers the door.<br> I say, "Where's Betsy?" And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years.<br>" Chilling! The best part is, we're filming in the desert outside of Vegas.<br> -You know what that means.<br> -I know.<br> Road trip! We can rent a car.<br> I have to be there by Tuesday.<br> Wait!

I can't decide which route to take to Vegas.<br> You've traveled a lot, right? Yeah, I've been around.<br> Which route should I take? The north or the south route? If you take the north route, there's a man with a beard of bees.<br> Great! Problem solved! On the south route, there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.<br> Well, back to square one.<br> I know a way that you can decide.<br> I'll ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.<br> Yes! Good.<br> But wait.<br> Here we go.<br> I want you to relax.<br> Take a deep breath.<br> Clear your mind.<br> -Peanut butter or egg whites? -Peanut butter.<br> -Be a fireman or a swimmer? -Swimmer.<br> -You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel? -Monica.<br> I always thought it'd be Rachel.<br> -No thinking.<br> Tie or ascot? -Ascot.<br> -North or south route? -North.<br> Bam!

I don't know.<br> I know how we can decide.<br> I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick.<br> -Action or comedy? -Action.<br> Who would you rather sleep with, Monica or Rachel? Dude, you are sick.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.<br> Oh, my God.<br> What does that thing do? -An eye removal machine.<br> -I'm out of here.<br> I'm kidding.<br> Rachel, I'm Dr.<br> Miller.<br> Monica said you were nervous.<br> Everything will be fine.<br> -So we're done.<br> -Almost, but first we gotta start.<br> This is a glaucoma test.<br> Sit down.<br> Put your chin here.<br> Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.<br> What? A small puff of air.<br> Now, come on! Here we go.<br> One, two, three.<br> I'm sorry.<br> All right.<br> I'm gonna stay in here this time.<br> Ready? -One, two -I'm sorry.<br> You know what? I'm gonna hold her head.<br> That's okay.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're young.<br> You don't have glaucoma.<br> So it was very, very nice to meet you, sir.<br> What are you? Are you crazy? You got a small, minor infection in that left eye.<br> Take these drops for a week and you'll be as good as new.<br> No, I don't put things in my eye.<br> We'll see you here in three months.<br> And I'll fit you for a glass eye.<br> Give me the damn drops! Dr.<br> Miller?

You ready to go? How cold will it be there? Will all these sweater vests be enough? -What? -I love you.<br> I wish Ross was coming with us.<br> I'll miss him.<br> Thanks.<br> I just got that jerk out of my mind.<br> Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite? Not really.<br> It's an independent film.<br> We don't have a big budget.<br> I'll stay in your room.<br> Once you get paid, you'll be springing for a suite.<br> They must be paying you a lot.<br> For every dollar Shutterspeed makes one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.<br> You don't get paid unless it makes money? Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for 10 years.<br>" I'm gonna be a millionaire! I wanted to say goodbye.<br> And to see if you guys would place a little bet for me.<br> Twenty bucks on black 15.<br> -You got it! -All right.<br> -You remember the number, right? -Yeah, black 13.<br> -Black 15! -You got it.<br> -All right.<br> Bye-bye, now.<br> -Bye, you guys.<br> I'll say bye at the car.<br> Anyone wanna say bye to me at the car? I'll say goodbye to you at the car if you don't mind the pus.<br> See you! But wait a minute.<br> The pus is good.<br> It means it's healing.<br> Hey, Phoebe.<br> What you reading? Hello? Come on! Sorry, I didn't see you there.<br> Phoebe, are you mad at me or something? If you are, please tell me what it is I did.<br> -lf you don't know, I can't help you.<br> -I don't know.<br> Well, I can't help you.<br> Well, whatever it is, I am very, very sorry.<br> Okay? Apology accepted.<br> So we're good? I'll see you later, okay? Bye, fat-ass.<br> All right! Will you please tell me what it is that made you so mad at me? I don't know! I don't remember! What do you mean, you can't remember? I was so focused on being mad at you, I forgot what it was I was mad about.<br> If you can't remember, can't we just forget about this? Oh, no.<br> I am mad at you.<br> I know that much.<br> But I'm sorry about the fat-ass thing because you have a sweet, little heinie.<br> I'm getting pretty tired.<br> You'll have to take over soon.<br> We've been driving for a half-hour.<br> You haven't looked at the road once.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's out there.<br> Maybe I just need lunch.<br> You wanna eat? My treat.<br> Isn't that Ross' money? Ross' treat.<br> Where do you wanna eat? I don't know.<br> I know how we can decide.<br> I'll ask you questions.<br> And then you have to answer real fast.<br> So clear your mind.<br> Clear it right out.<br> Clear it out.<br> It's all clear except for this image of a small, purple lamp.<br> Is that all right if that stays in there? I don't see why not.<br> I guess.<br> You have to answer with the first thing that pops into your head, okay? -Would you rather be too wet or too dry? -Too dry.<br> -Do you believe in ghosts? -No.<br> -Will this movie be my big break? -No.<br> -What? -Yes.<br> -Dude, you said, no.<br> -I also said, yes.<br> -This won't be my big break? -No.<br> I don't believe this.<br> Look, I just don't want you to get your hopes up too high.<br> What are you talking about? I'm the lead in a movie! They're not even paying you! This doesn't sound like a real movie! I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.<br> I don't think this is gonna be your big break.<br> Are you on this trip to make me feel like a loser? -I'd rather be alone.<br> -You don't want me here? Not if you're like this.<br> The next time you ask me a question like that, I'll lie.<br> I don't want you on the trip.<br> Why don't you pull over.<br> I'll get out now.<br> Fine.<br> Get out.<br> You can't stop on a bridge.<br> -Get out! -Fine! Wait! Wait! There's no sidewalk! Yeah.<br> I'm gonna die here.<br> Are you mad at me because my hair gel smells? Because I said your handwriting is childlike? No.<br> That made me feel precious.<br> Because he's always correcting people's grammar? "Whom, whom.<br>" Sometimes it's "who"! Yeah? Sometimes it's: Did you beat him at a board game? He's such a baby when he loses.<br> Okay, I'm the baby.<br> Hey! Stop it! What are you doing here? Joey kicked me out of the car on the bridge.<br> -Why? -I don't know.<br> He went crazy.<br> We played that game where you ask questions and answer fast.<br> That game should not be played without my supervision.<br> I don't know what made him mad.<br> All I said was that this wouldn't be his big break that it wouldn't do anything for him and that it didn't sound real.<br> Okay, he should've pushed me off the bridge.<br> What's in the bag? I figured you'd be mad at me so I got gifts that I found on the roadside.<br> -Who wants the one-legged teddy bear? -I do! -Not even close.<br> -I need help! I can't do this.<br> Come on.<br> Let's do it.<br> Sit down.<br> All right, put your head back.<br> -Now open your eyes.<br> -Okay, they are.<br> -How many fingers am I holding up? -Four.<br> I was thinking four.<br> -Really? -Yes! Why don't we start with a practice one.<br> -No drops.<br> -Great! On three.<br> One, two, three.<br> My pillow's all wet! Well, you said it was practice! Why did you move? I knew you were lying! -Come here.<br> -What are you doing? Stop it! Oh, my God! I am going.<br> Turn it over! I am going to get get these drops in your eye.<br> Oh, my God! You really are freakishly strong.<br> Stop! Stop! Stop it! Damn, it's empty! If Joey and Chandler walked in now, we could make a fortune.<br> That is definitely Chandler, Joey or Ross.<br> Or Rachel.<br> It's Joey.<br> Chandler told me what happened.<br> He's really upset.<br> Not as upset as he'll be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests.<br> What did you do to them? There's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.<br> I gotta ask Phoebe something about the car.<br> Hold on one second.<br> -Hey, dude.<br> -Hey, Phoebe.<br> This wooden box keeps sliding out.<br> What is it? My grandma.<br> And thanks.<br> She's having a great time.<br> Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.<br> Chandler's here.<br> He was wondering if I guess he ran out of change.<br> How am I gonna apologize to him if he won't even talk to me? Send him something.<br> So when he gets there, he'll know you're sorry.<br> That's a good idea.<br> I wonder where I could get a basket of porn? No, don't say, "I'm sorry," with porn.<br> You should send him a carton of cigarettes.<br> Because that way he can trade it for protection.<br> No.<br> That's prison.<br> I know how we're gonna figure this out.<br> Clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head.<br> -Do you like flora or fauna? -Fauna.<br> -Simon or Garfunkel? -Garfunkel.<br> -Why are you mad? -You said I was boring.<br> When did I say that? Oh, my God! I remember now! We were playing chess.<br> Phoebe, you and l have never played chess.<br> Remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing.<br> You said I was boring.<br> Then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz.<br> There's a chance this may have been a dream.<br> So this entire time, you've been angry with me because of a dream? Well, guess what, now I'm mad at you.<br> I wanted to make sure this wasn't a dream.<br> Otherwise we're wasting our time.<br> Stanley! Your leading man is here.<br> Let's get to work.<br> Slight change of plans.<br> We've shut down.<br> What? Why? It's a money thing.<br> We don't have any.<br> You're kidding, right? What? It's probably just temporary.<br> We're hoping to get some money soon.<br> Just hang out.<br> Hang out? How long? I don't know.<br> A week.<br> Maybe two.<br> The money will turn up.<br> People always wanna invest in movies.<br> You're not rich? Worth a shot.<br> Well, Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay? Hey, pal.<br> Are you Joey Tribbiani? These got left for you.<br> Thanks.<br> "Congratulations on your big break.<br>" -Monica, it's Joey.<br> -Hey, Joey.<br> You remember me even though you're a star.<br> Come on.<br> It'll be years before I forget you.<br> What's it like on a movie set? Do you have a dressing room and a chair with your name? Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.<br> Tell Chandler he couldn't have been more wrong.<br> I gotta go, Monica.<br> My sushi's here.<br> Sorry about that.<br> Thanks for waiting.<br> Everybody smile.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Enjoy your stay at Caesars.<br> We hope it's toga-rific.<br> Kill me.<br> Kill me now.<br> Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide? Go! What are you doing? Get off! Oh, my God! Hold it open.<br> Okay.<br> We'll see you in about three or four hours.<br>   <br>
