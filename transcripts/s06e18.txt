                    			Hey.<br> I just got my teacher evaluations.<br> Look what this student wrote.<br> "I loved Dr.<br> Geller's class.<br> Mind-blowing lectures.<br> Dr.<br> Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the Paleontology Department.<br> " "Hotties of Paleontology.<br> " There's a big-selling calendar, eh? -Who wrote it? -The evaluations are all anonymous.<br> -You still have their exams? -Yeah.<br> You could just match the handwriting and, boom, there's your admirer.<br> A hot girl's at stake, and he becomes Rain Man.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Why are we so sure that this is a girl? It's a girl! Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay? Because I'm a teacher.<br> She's a student.<br> -It's against the rules? -It's frowned upon.<br> -Besides, there's a big age difference.<br> -When you're 90-- I know, she'll be 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.<br> No, that's not what I was gonna say at all.<br> When you're 90, you'll still have the memory of being with a 20-year-old.<br> The One Where Ross Dates A Student Gelula/SDI Chandler, you know your college friend who became a movie director? Oh yeah, Dana Keystone.<br> She was in my movement class.<br> -What's a movement class? -He's pretending he didn't take mime.<br> She's directing a new AI Pacino movie.<br> You gotta get me an audition.<br> I haven't talked to her in, like, 1 0 years.<br> Please, Chandler, I would owe you so much.<br> You do owe me so much.<br> You owe me 3000-- Hey, hey, dude.<br> Why you changing the subject? What? -Will you make the call? -Okay, I'll try.<br> Thanks.<br> Last auditions are Thursday, so I gotta get in by Thursday.<br> Just remember Thursday.<br> Can you remember Thursday? Yeah, so Tuesday? Thursday! Just think of it like this: The third day.<br> Monday, one day.<br> Tuesday, two day.<br> Wednesday.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> When, huh, what day? Thursday! The third day, okay? -Thank you.<br> -Okay.<br> -I'm gonna check my messages.<br> -You thought of that in there? Sure, nature called.<br> She wants to see who else did.<br> Hello? Rachel.<br> Someone is in our apartment.<br> Call the cops! You're on the phone! -Oh, my God! -What? Oh, my God! Thank you! Fire department put out a fire at our place! -Oh, my God! How bad was it? -It was a fire, I'm guessing not good.<br> -Come on, we gotta go! -Yeah, come on.<br> What are you smiling about? The part I want to audition for is a fireman.<br> This is so meant to be! You were very generous with your grades this semester.<br> -Professor Geller? -Yeah? -I really enjoyed your class.<br> -Oh, thank you.<br> Thanks very much.<br> I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a "hottie.<br> " -That was you? -Yeah.<br> I felt a little weird about it.<br> You're a teacher.<br> I'm a student.<br> Want to go out sometime? That's not the best idea.<br> Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over.<br> -You're not my teacher anymore.<br> -What time? Oh, you know what? Forget it.<br> I see you already gave me an A.<br> -Gotcha.<br> -I'm kidding! God! So seriously, what time? Coming through.<br> Coming through.<br> Oh! Hello.<br> Hi.<br> Right.<br> Coming through! Okay.<br> Well, it's not so bad.<br> Most of the damage was contained in the bedrooms.<br> Hey, buddy, think I could borrow your uniform this Thursday? -Excuse me? -Joey! He's working.<br> You would look good in that.<br> Oh, how bad is it? It's bad, it's really bad.<br> The only thing that isn't burned is an ax, which I do not remember buying.<br> -How's your room? -Everything's ruined.<br> My bed, my clothes.<br> Look at my favorite sweater.<br> Isn't that mine? Fine.<br> I'm sorry for your loss.<br> You won't be able to live here for a while.<br> You have a place to stay? Oh! Wow! Okay, look, pal.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I am not in the mood to be hit on right now.<br> But if you give me your number, I'll call you sometime.<br> Yes, they can stay with us.<br> Do you know what started the fire, Mr.<br> Fireman? Well, do either of you smoke? No, not usually.<br> But yeah, I could use one now.<br> Thanks.<br> -Do you light candles, burn incense? -Yes, I do all the time.<br> I love them! Oh, my God, I did it! It's me, it's me! I burned down the house! Okay, Phoebe, calm down.<br> There's no need to place blame.<br> Okay? I warned her about those candles.<br> It's great to catch up.<br> I can't believe how long it's been.<br> Hey, Chandler, is that.<br> .<br> .<br>? -Oh, that's great, good for you.<br> -So, is it.<br> .<br> .<br>? Okay.<br> So, yeah, maybe we can get together.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Can you hold on for one second? What? Do you want to get a pizza later? Hi, I'm back.<br> Yeah, that sounds great.<br> We'll do it then.<br> Okay, bye.<br> When's my audition? I know it's Thursday, but what time? Hi.<br> We didn't get to the audition.<br> I'm taking her to coffee.<br> We'll do it then.<br> Now you're going on a date with this girl? I haven't talked to her in 1 0 years.<br> You can't just call up and ask somebody for a favor.<br> There are rules, you know? You gotta put in some time.<br> Right, I'm sorry.<br> -It's not like she's an ex-girlfriend.<br> -We only went out once.<br> You dated her?! Not once.<br> Why don't I just go out with an ex, you know, and do Joey a favor? You want to do Joey a favor? Maybe you go out with Joey.<br> That's great.<br> My friend Joey's in the movie business.<br> You know who I ran into from school? Howie.<br> My friend's name is Joey.<br> Apparently, Howie's editing now.<br> Yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.<br> Can you believe that? You know, I haven't spoken to him in 1 0 years.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and he asks me for a favor? Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.<br> No "How you doing?" Man, I mean, not even a cup of coffee first.<br> -The nerve, huh? -Yeah.<br> Refill? This is last-minute, so I want to apologize for the mess.<br> Oh, who cares? Oh, my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.<br> I know! But there's only room for one, so one of you will have to stay at Joey's.<br> Since the fire was kind of my fault, you should get to stay here.<br> Hey, hey, now.<br> This was no one's fault.<br> It was an accident.<br> It was my fault.<br> You should get the nice room.<br> Okay! You're the first guest at "Hotel Monica.<br> " Hotel Monica! Just tell me how you like your eggs.<br> I thought I'd bring them to you in bed.<br> -You've been through so much.<br> -I have.<br> This right here is where I keep the pizza.<br> And that's where the napkin is.<br> -What's that smell? -I know! I don't.<br> .<br> .<br>? Oh, please, it was such a big class.<br> You never even noticed me.<br> What? Of course I did.<br> You sat next to "Sleepy Sleeperson.<br> " Who? Oh.<br> I had trouble remembering names, so I came up with nicknames.<br> The guy on the other side of you was "Smelly Von Brown Shirt.<br> " Oh, yeah.<br> -So did you have a nickname for me? -No.<br> No.<br> Yes, you did.<br> What was it? "Cutie McPretty.<br> " Oh, that's so sweet! Listen, I gotta tell you, I'm having a great time.<br> You said it might be weird, the whole student/teacher thing? And to be frank, I thought it would be too.<br> But it's not.<br> I mean, it's not at all.<br> -Dr.<br> Geller! -Burt! Did you sleep well last night? -I did.<br> -Yeah? Monica was so sweet.<br> She left a little mint on my pillow.<br> Know what Joey left on my pillow? Gum.<br> -We determined the cause of the fire.<br> -I know.<br> It was my candle, my candle! No, there was an appliance left on.<br> It looks like a curling iron.<br> -I don't use a curling iron.<br> -Someone does.<br> Don't look at me, my hair's straight.<br> Straight, straight, straight.<br> -It could've been a hair-straightener.<br> -Oh.<br> This is where I keep the pizza.<br> And-- Hey, where'd the napkin go? I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes.<br> Thanks, Monica.<br> -Does that smell bother you? -From Joey's? I can hardly smell it over here.<br> Well, you let me know if you can.<br> I can bake a pie to cover it.<br> -I can smell it a little, bake the pie.<br> -Okay.<br> Hello? One minute, please.<br> It's the fire inspector.<br> Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.<br> Really? Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair-straightener.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that started the fire.<br> No, no.<br> It was the candles.<br> Yeah.<br> It's very not good leaving candles unattended.<br> In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>okay, well I have to go now.<br> We had such a great time.<br> She's incredible.<br> I thought the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't.<br> Elizabeth is very mature for her age.<br> A concept lost on some people.<br> It's okay to date a student? Well, not really.<br> Technically, it's not against the rules.<br> But it's frowned upon, especially by the professor we saw last night: "Judgy Von Holier-than-thou.<br> " You don't want to get a reputation as "Professor McNails-his-students.<br> " -Yeah.<br> What should I do? -Well, it seems pretty clear.<br> What's more important? What people think or how you feel? -You gotta follow your heart.<br> -Joey, that's so sweet.<br> -Hi.<br> -Hey! So how'd it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open? Say, Thursday? -I couldn't do it.<br> -You couldn't do it? I need more time.<br> We're going to dinner.<br> You're going out with her again? -Going out with who? -Dana Keystone, from college.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Wasn't she.<br> .<br> .<br>? No, that was Dana Kaplan.<br> Oh.<br> -Joey, you didn't even know her! -Yeah, whatever.<br> Great story again.<br> The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo! You know, actually I should get going.<br> Oh, no, no, stay! Because you should stay.<br> Wow.<br> Oh, I am really flattered.<br> But I just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I don't feel that way about you.<br> Oh, no, no.<br> That's not-- I'm sorry, Chandler.<br> You know, you're such a sweet guy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I don't want to hurt you.<br> I wish I could do something to make you feel better.<br> No-- Really? Of course.<br> Well, it just hurts so bad, l.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> -Maybe there is one thing you can do.<br> -What? Anything.<br> Anything.<br> Well, I mean, this is just off the top of my head now.<br> But I have this friend-- This actor friend.<br> He would kill me if he knew that I was doing this.<br> But.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>would it be possible for him to audition for your movie on Thursday? Absolutely.<br> But.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you'd really feel better if your friend could audition for my movie? The heart wants what it wants.<br> Bye.<br> Hey! How's it going? Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.<br> Yes, it has.<br> I made cookies! I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.<br> But you should eat them now, because they're hot from the oven.<br> Okay.<br> But not in here! Can't eat them in bed, remember? No crummies! Oh.<br> Okay, I'll be out in a second.<br> Okay.<br> -What are you doing? -This doesn't lock, does it? -Oh! Joey, I'm sorry.<br> -It's all right, don't worry about it.<br> But look! That's gonna leave a stain.<br> Rach, hey, it's fine.<br> You're at Joey's.<br> -Really? -Yeah, look.<br> Yeah.<br> -I've never lived like this before.<br> -I know.<br> Well, don't waste it.<br> I mean, it's still food.<br> What do you want to do now? Want to get a drink? I can't.<br> -Oh, you have some studying to do? -No, I have some turning 21 to do.<br> You know, I remember when I was in college, we used to-- -What are you doing? -Nothing, I'm so comfortable with you.<br> Do you not want to be seen with me? No, of course I do.<br> Are they gone? No, they're still here.<br> But I think I'm about to leave.<br> What? No, no, wait, wait-- You're right, this is stupid.<br> Who cares what people think? I mean, we like each other, right? There's nothing wrong with that.<br> Come on.<br> Burt.<br> Lydia.<br> Mel.<br> -This is Elizabeth.<br> -Hi.<br> Aren't you in my popular culture class? That's right, Lydia.<br> Elizabeth is a student.<br> And we're dating.<br> And you may frown upon that but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we're not gonna hide it anymore.<br> You are so fired.<br> -What? -They'll fire you.<br> You can't date her.<br> It's against the rules.<br> Really? It's not just frowned upon? I love it at Joey's! -Nice! -Thanks.<br> So, you busy Thursday? Oh, very funny.<br> Remember? My audition was supposed to be Thursday.<br> You got me the audition? Let's hug it up! Okay, okay! What are you gonna do to me if you get the part? -Hey.<br> -Hi.<br> Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you.<br> I know they said the hair-straightener started the fire.<br> But I think I'm partly at fault.<br> You see, I didn't tell you, but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I had recently refilled the tissues.<br> And so, let's face it, that's just kindling.<br> So I think it's fair that I stay at Joey's.<br> No, no, no, this was my fault.<br> -Besides, I'm fine here.<br> -Okay.<br> -Chandler, Monica's looking for you.<br> -Really? -She said something about crummies.<br> -No, no, no! I was so careful.<br> You have to switch with me.<br> Monica is driving me crazy.<br> That's right.<br> All the ladies want to stay at Joey's.<br> No, I don't want to switch.<br> Please! I can throw wet paper towels here! No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink.<br> I know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> All right, fine.<br> This looks like so much fun.<br> God, what a mess.<br> Wow, it actually is in the handbook.<br> I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.<br> I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.<br> For what it's worth, I did appreciate you standing up for me.<br> That felt really nice.<br> Kind of made me like you even more.<br> I know, I know.<br> I really like you too.<br> But we can't date.<br> It's against the rules.<br> It's forbidden.<br> Wow.<br> What? Just hearing you describe it as "forbidden" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it's really hot.<br> Really? Yeah.<br> Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's wrong.<br> -Stop it.<br> -No, no.<br> It's wrong.<br> It's naughty.<br> It's.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>taboo.<br> Shut the book.<br> Hey.<br> Let's also get a hot plate.<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> So? So.<br> .<br> .<br>? It's Thursday! How was the audition? It's-- Monday, one day.<br> Tuesday, two day.<br> Wednesday, what day-- Oh!   <br>
