                    			Are you looking at naked tribeswomen? No, look.<br> That's a pig.<br> I know.<br> But look at the knobs on it! Emily's cousin kicked me out.<br> -What? -Why? When you sublet from your wife's cousin then you divorce, sometimes the cousin wants his apartment back.<br> Didn't you sign a lease? Who needs a lease when it's "family"? You can stay with us.<br> Anything you need.<br> But you have to let us know when you feel better so we can make fun of your hair.<br> You got it.<br> Thanks, I really appreciate this.<br> I'm going to get packing again.<br> I've been moving around so much that I feel like a nomad.<br> -What? -He thought you said gonad.<br> The One Where Ross Moves ln If every place were this clean, it'd be tough making a living.<br> Oh, Larry! Do health inspectors work on commission? No, bribes.<br> -It's okay to laugh? -I was just kidding.<br> -I'll check the kitchen floor.<br> -Knock yourself out.<br> I don't get violations.<br> You could eat beans off that floor.<br> But don't, because that'd be a violation.<br> Yummy! Yeah, I'd let him check out my kitchen floor.<br> A ninety-eight.<br> I deducted two points for not wearing your hat.<br> That is a Section 5 violation.<br> Now look, Larry, honey.<br> I wrote the book on Section 5.<br> You only need to wear it in the kitchen.<br> -Where's your hat? -ln the kitchen.<br> I'll get it.<br> There's the two points! You should really read that book you wrote.<br> You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew she'd go in hatless to get it.<br> You could have your own health inspector detective show.<br> I don't know about that.<br> But then I could be your sidekick, Voonda.<br> Maybe I could ask Voonda to dinner sometime? She would love that since you know all the clean places to eat.<br> I'll call you.<br> He's so funny! Thank you.<br> How's Ross doing since all the Emily stuff? He's not great.<br> But he's dealing with it.<br> Wait, you're not I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again.<br> He'll be screwed up for a long time.<br> Besides, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.<br> Right, you only go for them five minutes before they get married.<br> -Two pounds of mocha java.<br> -It's Danny.<br> Are you going to go out again? I don't know.<br> He hasn't called since we went out.<br> I see him in the hallway.<br> We flirt.<br> I'm all: And then nothing.<br> Wow, thirsty.<br> I'm having a party on Saturday.<br> Sort of a housewarming thing.<br> -Fun.<br> -Great! I'm looking forward to it.<br> See you! So I guess we won't be warming his house.<br> All right, I see what he's doing.<br> He's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out.<br> And you won't do that.<br> That's right! Because that would give him the control.<br> So now he comes up with this "I've got a party" thing to get me to hint for an invitation.<br> Blew up in his face, didn't it? So there is no party? No, there's a party.<br> There's a party.<br> But the power? That is still up for grabs.<br> You follow me? I think so.<br> So he won't invite you to his party because he likes you? Exactly! Then why didn't he invite me? To throw me off.<br> Hey, roomies! I love what you've done with the place.<br> I know it's a lot of boxes.<br> -I appreciate you letting me stay here.<br> -Not a problem.<br> Since you'll be here a while we could put your name on the answering machine.<br> I hope you don't mind but I kind of already jazzed it up a little.<br> Check it out.<br> We will We will call you back Pretty cool.<br> -You're fake laughing too, right? -The tears are real.<br> You look beautiful this evening.<br> Show me the badge again.<br> Shiny.<br> You mind if I wash up? Who knows where these have been? You are just nonstop! -We're out of here.<br> -Why? I saw 1 0 violations.<br> I'm shutting this place down! -You have the power to do that? -This does.<br> Shut it down.<br> What are you doing? Nothing.<br> You built a fort, didn't you? Kind of.<br> Oh, my God! The air purifier.<br> Ross' air purifier.<br> All I heard for four years through college was.<br> You should have gone out once in a while.<br> -I hate this thing! -Come on, Chandler.<br> Ross is our friend.<br> He needs us right now.<br> So why don't you be a grownup and come watch TV in the fort? Can't believe that Larry closed down Churman's.<br> I love that place.<br> You should have heard about all their violations.<br> Larry said that they should call it Vermin's.<br> That guy just plain kills me.<br> I wanted to invite you to the party.<br> Thanks, I'll try to stop by.<br> Actually, I think I'm going to be busy.<br> You are? Remember, I've got that gala? What's the gala for? It's a regatta gala.<br> Do you sail? No, but I support it.<br> I hope I see you tomorrow night.<br> Take care.<br> Walked right into that one, didn't he? What one? You wanted him to invite you and he did.<br> He waited until the last minute.<br> So if I said yes he'd know I had nothing better to do than wait for his invitation.<br> But I said no which puts me back in the driver's seat.<br> So the ball is in his court? Ball? No, there's no ball.<br> Hey, Phoebe, you want to join us? -Oh, sure, yeah.<br> Where is this from? -It's from Sun Ling's.<br> Oh, Larry just told me something about Sun Ling.<br> Oh, no, thank you.<br> Joey, please.<br> Sorry.<br> Hello, children.<br> You want to play some foosball? Please? We moved the table into my room because of all the boxes.<br> Come on! I have one question.<br> What is the deal with this? Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand? No, the quiet down thing.<br> You mean this.<br> I don't know how much more I can take.<br> Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with a show about bugs? My God! What if that had been porn? All right, this may be tough but it's Ross.<br> I survived college with him.<br> I guess I can hold out a little longer.<br> Let's have a game.<br> Fellas? So he's out of here.<br> Got anything to eat? I went to Jono's and it was closed.<br> I took Larry there, but it was all violated, so we shut it down.<br> If this guy keeps closing our favorite places, where will we eat? I don't know.<br> Clean places? Yum! It's Danny.<br> Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a gala.<br> We'll be right there.<br> Can't you say it's later? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night? The fake kind.<br> -I need a ladle.<br> You got a ladle? -We have a ladle.<br> See you at the party.<br> You know what Larry would say? He'd say, "See you ladle.<br>" I'm done.<br> You want anything? Sports? International? Apartment listings? I'll take sports.<br> Mine! All right, international.<br> That's mine too.<br> I'm ltalian.<br> I could check apartment listings, though there's never anything here.<br> Not even on page seven? You're right.<br> Here's an affordable place.<br> Two-bedroom, close to work.<br> It's available in five weeks.<br> What about that circled one? It's kind of expensive for a studio.<br> But it's available now.<br> Isn't it? Yes, it is.<br> Let's go look at it! There we go! Guys, would you chip in for some new air filters for the purifier? I mean, after all, we are all using it.<br> Let's go quicker! Oh, my God! Look at this kitchen/bathroom.<br> That's great! So you can cook while in the tub.<br> Somebody was using his head.<br> Let's check out the rest of the place.<br> I think this is it.<br> I don't know.<br> Maybe we should keep looking.<br> But this place is available now.<br> You don't want to be stuck with us for five weeks.<br> So you think I should take this place? It's perfect! How about you? Kitchen, slash, bathroom.<br> I see what you guys are saying.<br> I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.<br> We are bad people.<br> He knew we were trying to get rid of him.<br> Could we get a bathtub in our kitchen? Ready for dinner? -Absolutely.<br> -Great.<br> You wanted to go to the ltalian place on Bleecker St.<br>? I love that place! So, no.<br> How about Mama Lozetti's? Sure.<br> How long has that milk been sitting out? No, this place is totally healthy.<br> This milk is mine.<br> I bought this today because I was thirsty for milk, you know? Okay, let's go.<br> Hey, buddy.<br> Health Code 1 1 B requires that refuse be taken out the back exit.<br> But then I have to go all the way around.<br> So you choose convenience over health? Would you be interested in a free coffee? Stop, Larry.<br> Can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? It was exciting at first.<br> But now, it's like, so where are we going to eat ever? I suppose I could give him a warning.<br> Thank you.<br> Go, go! If, after dinner, you still need to bust someone I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.<br> Maybe we did good, helping Ross get back on his feet.<br> That was a nice place.<br> No closet space, but he could hang his stuff out the window in a bag.<br> What do we do? I don't know.<br> Maybe pizza? About Ross! It's the apartment manager.<br> Ross put us as references.<br> Ross is the greatest guy.<br> He's very reliable Of course, he has a big, huge dog that barks into the night.<br> Well, who doesn't love dogs? He's a tap dancer.<br> Yes, some would say that is a lost art.<br> He's a pimp! There you go.<br> He's a pimp.<br> He's a big, tap-dancing pimp! -Okay, honey, I'm ready.<br> -What are you doing? I am going to wander into the party and I will be all, you know: "l don't need this, I'm coming from a regatta gala.<br>" Did you get this out of a book? Monica, honey, this is as real as it gets.<br> This is never going to work.<br> He's right there.<br> Just go say hi.<br> I have to go downstairs and back up, as if I'm coming home from the gala.<br> So just go distract him.<br> But don't be sexy.<br> What's going on? This is a great party.<br> Great food.<br> You know, most parties, it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.<br> So.<br> What's this? Salad.<br> And what's this? Bread.<br> Aren't you a chef? Right, tonight was your party.<br> You look great! I'm glad you made it.<br> Well, you know, the gala had to end sometime.<br> Don't go anywhere.<br> I'll be right back.<br> Whose court is the ball in now? I thought there wasn't a ball.<br> Come on.<br> He's glad I came.<br> He doesn't want me to go anywhere.<br> Ball's flying all over the place.<br> This is my friend, Tom.<br> This is the girl I told you about.<br> Come on! You telling people about me? I think you two could really hit it off.<br> I'm gonna go mingle.<br> So you work at Bloomingdale's? My mom calls it "Bloomies.<br>" At ease, soldier! I'm sorry? You can just drop the act.<br> I know what's going on.<br> You're Danny's wingman, right? You guys are best buds, frat bros.<br> I'm going to go talk to a friend.<br> Yeah, you go talk to your friend.<br> Go tell him, "Nice try.<br>" He just keeps lobbing them up and I keep knocking them right out of the park.<br> I think I need a drink.<br> Ninety-eight ninety-nine one hundred! Okay.<br> Go.<br> Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.<br> Here we go, here we go.<br> So I didn't get that apartment.<br> Some problem with my application.<br> You're kidding? But Phoebe said I could stay at her place for a while, so.<br> Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.<br> We're roomies.<br> You don't need me taking up all your space.<br> We got plenty of space.<br> There's still some by that speaker.<br> Please, just stay.<br> Are you sure? -Definitely.<br> -You have to stay.<br> So I'm a pimp, huh? It's okay.<br> Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.<br> But just talk to me.<br> Tell me if something bothers you.<br> And I'll do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just.<br> Well, I see you've had a very productive day.<br> The cowboy hat's a little much.<br> Come on, it's fun! All right.<br> Isn't this a woman's hat? Stop talking crazy, and make us tea!   <br>
