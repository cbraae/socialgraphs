Why don't you go talk to my mom.<br> Okay, yeah, your mom.<br> She looks nice.<br> I can talk to her.<br> You do that, and I'm gonna go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding.<br> Bitsy? Listen, I wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.<br> Well, not at all.<br> Also, I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.<br> - Thank you.<br> I think so too.<br> - It's a testament to how he was raised.<br> Especially to you, because he's very respectful of women.<br> - Is he really? - He is so considerate of my feelings.<br> You know, I think you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.<br> Excuse me? No, don't get me wrong.<br> No, not in like a sissy way.<br> When he gets going he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave.<br> That's my boy.<br> Awesome.<br> I'm not gonna watch it.<br> I don't need to watch it.<br> I mean, what good could possibly come from watching it? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.<br> - Hey, dude, what's up? - Don't judge me! I'm only human! Did you take that tape? I had to! Lmagine you were married and you found a tape of your wife in another guy's apartment.<br> Wouldn't you need to know what was on it? I don't know.<br> Who am I married to? Some girl.<br> She hot? How did she get me to settle down? All right, I'm gonna watch it.<br> I mean, it's probably not even what I think it is.<br> Even if it is, it can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head.<br> Can it? See, in my experience, if a girl says yes to being taped she doesn't say no to much else, I'll tell you.<br> - Then you have to watch it for me.<br> - What? Just for a few seconds so I can know what it is.<br> Please? All right, fine.<br> But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame! - Why am I hearing cheering? - It's okay.<br> It's just a football game.<br> - It's just football? - You were all worried for nothing.<br> It's football! It's just football! This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football! I think it may be customary to get a beer! What the? - What are you doing? - You don't wanna see what I just saw! What are you guys doing? Oh, my God! Is that Richard? Okay, please laugh for Mommy.<br> Please? Please laugh for Mommy.<br> Not funny, huh? Well, so is it only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.<br> Because Mommy can rap.<br> I can't rap.<br> All right, sweetheart.<br> This is only because I love you so much.<br> And I know that you're not gonna tell anybody.<br> Emma, you're laughing! You are! You really do like big butts, don't you? You beautiful little weirdo.<br> You missed it! She was laughing! It was amazing.<br> It was amazing.<br> It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound.<br> I know, isn't it? What'd you do to get her to laugh? You know, I just A couple of things I tried.<br> Different Just sang a little "The ltsy-Bitsy Spider.<br>" You sang "Baby Got Back," didn't you? Nothing else worked! That girl is all about the ass! And then it goes back to the chorus.<br> Resolve.<br> And that's the end of the song.<br> I realize you hadn't asked to hear it but no one had spoken in 17 minutes.<br> Phoebe writes lots of songs.<br> What was that one you sang the other night? "Pervert Parade"? - "Ode to a Pubic Hair"? - Stop.<br> Oh, God.<br> Is that veal? Mom, I thought I told you, Phoebe's a vegetarian.<br> No, that's okay.<br> That's okay.<br> I mean, I am a vegetarian except for veal.<br> Yeah.<br> No.<br> Veal I love.<br> - Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.<br> - Any baby animals.<br> Kittens, fish babies.<br> But, you know, especially veal.<br> You know, and this nice vein of fat running through it.<br> Yummy.<br> So what do you think? So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment? Listen to the judgment from the porn star! That tape was never meant to be seen by Joey, I would feel more comfortable if this conversation were in private.<br> Monica, look, I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore.<br> Not ready to joke about it yet? See you later.<br> Why in the world would you take this tape? And why would you watch it? Because that's who I am.<br> Okay? I'm sure a man like Richard could see a tape like that and not be bothered.<br> It'd just be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and mustaches.<br> Is all of this about you not being able to grow a mustache? This is about you and Richard.<br> He's clearly not over you.<br> He keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants.<br> Isn't that sad? Can't you see how pathetic that is? Don't be jealous.<br> You should feel bad for him.<br> Yeah, well, poor Richard, he I can grow a mustache.<br> This is not our problem.<br> We have each other.<br> That's all that matters.<br> But I just keep picturing you rolling around with him, with your cowboy boots in the air.<br> Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life.<br> Good, good.<br> Play more because I wanna see how it ends.<br> - That's not me! - What? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em, cowgirl! That bastard taped over me! Is that a problem? It's just so insulting.<br> Spring for a new blank tape, doctor! I can't imagine what he sees in her.<br> She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his.<br> Hello, dear.<br> - What's going on? - We were just chitchatting.<br> - How's your friend? - A little better.<br> Do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.<br> You remember her, Michael.<br> She's lovely, well-behaved and single.<br> - I'm not interested.<br> - Please, darling, let's be honest.<br> You can have all the sailor fun you want with that one.<br> - But let's be real.<br> - All right, stop.<br> All Phoebe has done is try and get you to like her.<br> Maybe it's not clear but she did her best.<br> - She's a little different than you are.<br> - Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.<br> So what? If I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you.<br> You don't have to like her.<br> Just accept the fact that I do.<br> If you can't even be civil to the woman I love - The woman you what? - Yeah, the woman you what? The woman I love.<br> I love you.<br> Something I shouldn't say for the first time, in front of my parents and Tom and Sue.<br> Who are, by the way, the most sinfully boring people I've ever met in my life.<br> - I love you too.<br> - You do? How great is this? Wanna get out of here? - Mom, Dad.<br> Thanks for dinner.<br> - I had a great time.<br> It was really top-drawer.<br> And here's something rich.<br> Thirteen bathrooms in this place, I threw up in the coat closet.<br> Ta-ta! One more time from the top! Rachel, please! That is so inappropriate!   <br>
