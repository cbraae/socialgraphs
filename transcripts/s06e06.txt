                    			I'm moving out, so you're in charge of paying the rent.<br> -When's it due? -On the first.<br> And that's every month? No, just the months you want to live here.<br> Okay, here's the phone bill.<br> Oh, my God! That's our phone number.<br> I know I kind of sprung this me-moving-out-on-you thing.<br> -Why don't I cover you for a while? -No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>anymore.<br> -It's not charity, Joe.<br> -Forget it.<br> Thanks, but I'm done taking money from you.<br> I can take care of myself.<br> What's next? Come on.<br> Here's the electric bill.<br> -This is how much we pay for electric? -Well, yeah.<br> So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then? The One On The Last Night Gelula/SDI Will Joey have to give up the apartment? I offered him money, but he wouldn't take it.<br> How much does he need? $1 500 would cover him for a few months.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I have to trick him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride.<br> Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on skits whenever you want.<br> Well, that would help the pride thing.<br> Wow, you look great! Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow? Any plans for tonight? Instead of being sad on my last night with Rachel.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we're going out to celebrate Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.<br> -And also my birthday.<br> -It's not your birthday.<br> What a mean thing to say! I'd never tell you it wasn't your birthday.<br> You guys have anything planned for the big last night? Instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.<br> Knicks' season opener tonight.<br> I thought you'd come and watch it.<br> I don't know, Ross.<br> Not if you talk about how you gave up basketball to become a paleontologist.<br> I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist! -Pheebs-- -You're not dressed yet? We're supposed to start having fun in 1 5 minutes! And clearly, not a minute sooner.<br> You are packed, though, right? Please tell me you're packed? Of course I'm packed.<br> Monica, relax.<br> I wanted to ask Phoebe what I should wear.<br> My God, I can't get a minute of peace.<br> Oh, my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.<br> I know.<br> What you're wearing is fine for that.<br> You're not packed! You're not packed even a little bit! Surprise! Don't get mad, because this is what happened.<br> I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing?" I am lousy at packing, right? But you love packing! So as a gift to you on our last night.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I'll be coordinator! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.<br> I didn't get you anything.<br> Everybody has to help.<br> Phoebe, can you help? I have plans.<br> -You have plans with us.<br> -That's right.<br> Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift.<br> Tell the guys they have to help out.<br> My God, thank you! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves! The movers will be here in 1 1 hours.<br> Rachel hasn't packed.<br> Now, everybody has to help.<br> Chandler-- I have plans with Joey.<br> -You said you were doing nothing.<br> -Yes, but for the last time.<br> Fine.<br> Now, Ross-- -I can't do it.<br> -Why not? -Don't you have Ben? -Because I have Ben! It's almost past his bedtime.<br> Where is he? He's at a dinner party.<br> He's really coming? I can see in your apartment.<br> Of course he is.<br> What? You think I'd use my son as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am? All right.<br> Sorry.<br> I gotta go make a fake Ben.<br> Here it is.<br> Our last pizzas together as roommates.<br> I wish I knew that.<br> I ordered Chinese.<br> Well, that's okay.<br> In a way it's kind of nice.<br> You know? Our last dinner together.<br> Me, bringing the food of my ancestors.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you, the food of yours! I had an idea for what to do on our last night.<br> What do you say we play a little foosball for money? Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me since my injury-plagued '97 season.<br> -It'd be easier to give me your money.<br> -Yes, it would.<br> What do you say to $50? -You're on.<br> -Okay, let's play.<br> The big game.<br> Italy versus.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>China, apparently.<br> Look, it's the Rollerblades.<br> Oh, God! You remember when we got these? I guess you weren't there.<br> You guys, we said we were gonna have fun.<br> Come on.<br> Hey, remember the time.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You don't remember? Sorry, Pheebs.<br> I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.<br> I'm gonna miss you so much.<br> This doesn't have to be so sad, though, you know? Instead of thinking about how you'll miss each other.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you should think of the things you're not gonna miss.<br> I don't think there's anything.<br> Come on, there's gotta be something.<br> She's perfect.<br> I have one.<br> Okay, you can go first.<br> I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.<br> That's a good one.<br> Okay, Monica, anything? You know, does Rachel move the phone pen? Sometimes.<br> Always, actually.<br> There you go.<br> Doesn't everyone feel better? Not just the phone pen.<br> I never get my messages.<br> You get your messages.<br> It doesn't count if you have to read them off your hand.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>after you've fallen asleep on the couch.<br> So you missed a message from who? Chandler? Or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom? It worked! No one's sad! I win again! That's, like, 500 bucks you owe me! Man! Five hundred dollars.<br> That is a lot of electricity, huh? I gotta buy some food.<br> Give me a chance to win my money back.<br> Sudden death.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>one goal, $1 000.<br> -You serious? -Yes! Get ready to owe me.<br> Here we go.<br> Ready? No.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>one can beat me! That's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking.<br> Hi, Ross.<br> See, other people call me! Your brother.<br> Score! What's up? I'm here with Ben.<br> Thought we'd say hi.<br> Put him on.<br> Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.<br> I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now.<br> He's smiling, though.<br> Okay, talk to you later.<br> I think it was better when you guys were sad.<br> Hey, remember the Rollerblades? You know what else I won't miss? "I'm Monica.<br> I wash the toilets 1 7 times a day, even if people are on it! " "Hi, I'm Rachel.<br> Is my sweater too tight? I'd better wash it and shrink it! " "I'm Monica.<br> I never get messages from interesting people.<br> " I call her.<br> "Oh, my God! I love Ross.<br> I hate Ross.<br> I love Ross.<br> I hate Ross! " "My God! I can't find a boyfriend.<br> I'll stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find there! " We should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.<br> Still broken? It sucks, man.<br> Your last night, and I lose the two most important things: The foosball table.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and $500.<br> There are other ways to win back your money.<br> How about blackjack? Not my game.<br> You know what? We can play a new game.<br> -It's fun! -What's it called? Cups.<br> -I don't know how.<br> -I'll teach you.<br> It's easy and fun.<br> -All right.<br> -Here you go.<br> I have two queens.<br> What do you have? -A 2 and a 5.<br> -You win! Fifty dollars! -Really? -Let's play again.<br> -What have you got? -4 and a 9.<br> You're kidding, right? -No.<br> Why? -That's a full cup! Damn, I am good at Cups! I'm not talking to her.<br> You have to take the first step.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because she's the one who's leaving.<br> It's harder for her.<br> Maybe you're right.<br> But she made fun of my phone pen! I know.<br> I took it hard too.<br> I feel bad about what happened-- -What are you doing? -I'm unpacking.<br> I'm not moving.<br> Is that picture straight? It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left.<br> You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler! You should go! Why do I have to leave? -It's my apartment! -It's mine too! What else you got? How about: You're moving! This is ridiculous.<br> We should be packing you! -Hey, how you guys doing? -Great.<br> Monica's moving.<br> I am not! Really? How come all your stuff is in this box? Okay, you guys, I think I know what's going on here! You guys? Stop! I know you're acting mad because it'll make it easier to leave.<br> But deep down, you're really sad.<br> Deep, deep down.<br> -No, Phoebe, I am mad! -Well, deep down! I'm just mad.<br> Then keep running.<br> You win! -What did you have? -Nothing beats.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>a three and a six.<br> That, my friend, is "D Cup.<br> " How much have you won so far? -700.<br> -Not 700 exactly? Double it.<br> In Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.<br> I didn't make up the rules.<br> Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get one card.<br> That one card could be worth $1 00, which brings your total to $1 500.<br> Don't get excited, that won't happen unless you get the-- No way! This is the last box of your clothes.<br> I'm just gonna label it "What were you thinking?" I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.<br> Guys, I don't wanna make things worse, but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore.<br> You're so mean to each other.<br> I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel.<br> I still like you.<br> That's fine because I'm not moving.<br> Phoebe, you gotta take her.<br> I said some bad stuff.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but Rachel has qualities that make her a good roommate.<br> Like what, Monica? She has 1 47,000 pair of boots? Good start, Mon.<br> She lets you borrow them.<br> And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet.<br> Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold! She gets tons of catalogs and folds down the pages of things I'd like.<br> What else? When I take a shower.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she leaves me notes on the mirror.<br> I do.<br> I do do that.<br> That's nice.<br> I like having things to read in the bathroom.<br> When I fall asleep on the couch.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she covers me with a blanket.<br> Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold.<br> And when I told her I was gonna move in with Chandler.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she was really supportive.<br> You were so great.<br> You made it so easy.<br> And now you have to leave.<br> And I have to live with a boy! It's gonna be fine.<br> Now I can't wait to live with you! You know what we should do? Bring Monica, and we'll live together! We'll have so much fun! I think she's moving in with Chandler.<br> Oh, that's right.<br> You're still set on that? Kinda.<br> Oh, my God! How's the packing going? Ben? He's fine.<br> He's right-- Oh, my God! Get your head out of your shirt there, son! Yeah, it's a pumpkin.<br> I'll come pack.<br> -What's wrong? -Ross and I were helping pack.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>took a little break.<br> I lost $1 500 to him in Cups! How did you lose at Cups? The same way you lost! I started out with the king and the queen.<br> Bam! Ross gets a 2 and a 3.<br> Then I get a jack and a king.<br> Boom! Ross gets a 4 and 5.<br> Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the sitting-down bonus.<br> I didn't even get half a cup! Nothing! Oh, man! He never played before either.<br> I think beginner's luck is very important in Cups! Let's play one more hand.<br> One more hand.<br> No more! I cannot lose another dime.<br> I'm serious this time.<br> In fact, look.<br> I wanna give you something.<br> Let me give it to you before I pawn it for Cups money.<br> I want you to have the big, white dog.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>as a thank-you for being such a great roommate.<br> I can't take the big, white dog.<br> You love it.<br> It's "him.<br> " Not "it.<br> " What if I bought it from you? Then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.<br> Say $1 500? Wait a second.<br> I see what you're trying to do here.<br> You're trying to give me money again! When did I try to give you money? Over there with the bills! You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it.<br> We had a nice last night together.<br> We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money.<br> Now you start with the charity thing again! I'm trying to help you out.<br> I wanna make sure that you're okay.<br> I will be okay.<br> You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself.<br> I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money.<br> The only thing I'm gonna miss.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is you.<br> And now the dog.<br> -Call me when you get there, okay? -Okay.<br> I'm really gonna miss you.<br> I have your key.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Thanks.<br> God, this is silly.<br> I'll see you in a couple of hours.<br> Bye, house.<br> -She really left.<br> -I know.<br> -Thank you.<br> -No problem, roomie.<br> -Can I ask you a question? -Sure.<br> What the hell is that dog doing here? I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.<br> -And now you want that money back? -Exactly.<br> What kind of idiot do you take me for? It's not a real game.<br> I made it up.<br> I'm sorry you lost your money.<br> But I won it fair and square.<br> At a fake game! If you wanna try to make some of it back.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'd be glad to play you for it.<br> But I should warn you.<br> I am very good at Cups.<br> I assume the saucer card came up when you played last? Let's see if it comes up this time.<br>   <br>
