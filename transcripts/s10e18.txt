Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.<br>.<br> - Come in.<br> - Morning.<br> What's that? - It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.<br> - It's a baby chick and duck! - Uh-huh.<br> And I named them Chick Jr.<br> and Duck Jr.<br> - I did not see that coming.<br> - Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house you know?

The next baby should be along in a minute.<br> - We only ordered one! - You know it's twins, right? - Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know! I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.<br> - Well, gosh.<br> That makes me feel so special and good.<br> Wait, did you know it was twins? Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.<br> - Anybody tell you? - I don't think so.<br> Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats.<br> But I thought that was just mine and the baby's.<br> They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.<br> - This is unbelievable.<br> - Twins actually run in my family.<br> - Interesting! Can I see you for a second? - What do we do? - What do you mean "what do we do"? Twins!! Twins!! - Chandler, you're panicking! - Ah-ha Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one? - We can't split them up! - Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited I mean, that's a great day for everybody.<br> - Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible? - What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king? - Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.<br> - Monica, we are not ready to have two babies! - That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this.<br> I don't care if it's two babies.<br> I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children! It looks like we're about ready over here.<br> Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.<br> Here she comes! - She? It's a girl? - Yeah.<br> - Well, now we have one of each! And that's enough! - And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.<br> - Oh my God! - What did you say? - Nothing! What do you say to that? - Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel! - No way! - You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do? - What? - Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.<br> - Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together If she did, she might feel differently.<br> She might not even go.<br> - You really think so? - I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.<br> Don't take no for an answer.<br> - Don't let love fly away.<br> - Hi! - Can't a girl finish a song around here? - Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.<br> - Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight? - No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.<br> - Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.<br> - Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma! - Alright, you know what? You're right.<br> I should at least tell her how I feel.<br> - Ross, wait, wait! - What? What? - Could you get me a muffin? - Rachel ? - Yeah? I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you I love you.<br> I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but.<br>.<br> I thought you should know.<br> Gunther I love you too.<br> Probably not in the same way, but I do.<br> And, and when I'm in a cafÃ©, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you.<br> - Oh Bye guys.<br> - Bye.<br> - Oh my God! - Unbelievable! - Hey, you know what might help? - I'm not getting you a muffin! - Do you think they recognize each other from in there? - Maybe.<br> Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day, they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.<br> We're going to take Erica to recovery now.<br> - There's something that we wanna tell you.<br> We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.<br> - Oh my God, that's just like my name! - Son of a gun, it is! - Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest.<br> I'm really glad I picked you guys.<br> You're gonna make great parents.<br> Even Chandler.<br> - Okay, well, bye! - Bye! - We'll call you! - Have fun at church-camp! - Oh, look at these little bunnies! - I know! You ready to trade? - We could trade later.<br> - Yeah, I'm good.<br> - Hey, what are you working on? - It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.<br> - How sweet! Oh, is that the baby? - No, I sat in the paint.<br> - Hey.<br> So, did you talk to Rachel? - No, and I'm not going to.<br> - What? - Why not? - Because she's just going to shoot me down.<br> You guys saw what happened with Gunther.<br> That did not look like fun.<br> - How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way.<br> You have a relationship with her, - you slept together last night! - Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.<br> - Yeah, I know what you mean.<br> I mean, sometimes - Uh, Joe? - Damn it! - Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now.<br> Okay? I'll be seeing her again.<br> We've got time.<br> -  No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody.<br> Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's It's a city of Gunthers! - Hey! What do you have there? Oh, I made a little something.<br> If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but.<br>.<br> - Oh my God! You did that yourself? - Honey, that's gorgeous!.<br> - You know, the baby can't read, Mike! - Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here.<br> I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane.<br> I wanna see the baby! - Monica just called from the cab.<br> She said they should be here any minute.<br> And apparently, there's some big surprise.<br> - Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.<br> Hey, so what is the big surprise? - Oh my God! - Okay, okay, awkward question : The hospital knows you took two, right? - Yes, it's twins! - Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?

Jack Bing, Morning Gazette : "I'm gonna blow this story wide open!" Wow, so beautiful.<br> I want one.<br> - Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.<br> Seriously.<br> Wanna make one of those? - One? How about a whole bunch? - Really? - Yeah! - Ooh, we could teach them to sing, .<br>and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis.<br> Although that sounds kinda dull.<br> - Oh, you guys, I can't believe this  But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.<br> - I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.<br> - Me too.<br> Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this!

You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe maybe sleeping together was.<br>.<br> the perfect way to say goodbye.<br> They slept together? I was with you! - But now she'll never know how he feels! - Maybe that's okay.<br> You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way I mean, now, now you can move on I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.<br>.<br> Right? - Maybe now you can actually do it.<br> You know?

Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life  my time-machine.<br>" - Did that movie ever get made? - It did not.<br> - Ross, where are you going? - To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab? - What? are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate?

She's almost never right.<br> - But she is sometimes? - Well - Wait, what are you doing? - Well, I can't take this plane now.<br> Excuse me, sir? - where are you going? - I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling.<br>.<br> something's wrong with the left phalange.<br> - Could I get some peanuts? - What's wrong with the plane? - There's nothing wrong with the plane.<br> - Yeah!
