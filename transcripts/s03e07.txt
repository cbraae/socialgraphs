It's this great part.<br> This boxer named Nick.<br> And I' m so, so right for it.<br> He's just like me.<br> Except that he's a boxer.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and has an evil twin.<br> Hear ye, hear ye! Delivery from the Mattress King! You Miss Geller? Sign here.<br> Do I have a middle name?

All right, put them up.<br> Hey, you' re pretty good at this.<br> I had to learn.<br> I was staying at the "Y" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and some of the young men weren't acting Christian enough.<br> Hey, now! And I' m bleeding.<br> Okay, great.<br> Wow! And I' m a vegetarian! I' m sorry.<br> We'll put some ice on it.<br> Put your head back.<br> -I can't see.<br> -I have you.<br> Oh, God! Which bedroom do you want it in, Ms.<br> Geller? It's the compulsively neat one by the window.<br> Gotcha.<br> Hi, Daddy! This is where they put us? What? There was no table in the kitchen? -Hello, baby.<br> -You remember Ross.<br> Nice to see you again, Dr.<br> Greene.<br> So! -How's the library? -Museum.<br> -What happened to the library? -There never was a library.<br> I mean, there are libraries.<br> It's just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I've never worked at one.<br> You know what's really good here? The lobster.<br> -Shall I just order three? -If you' re really hungry.<br> It was a joke.<br> I made a joke.<br> Actually, Daddy, Ross is allergic to lobster.<br> Who's allergic to lobster? I guess someone that works in a library.<br> -It's-- -I know.<br> It's a museum! You' re the only who can make a joke? At least mine was funny.<br> Waiter.<br> We will have two lobsters and a menu.<br> So, Dr.<br> Greene, how's the old boat? They found rust.<br> Do you know what rust does to a boat? Gives it a nice antique-y look? Rust is boat cancer, Ross.<br> Wow, I' m sorry.<br> When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.<br> Excuse me for a moment.<br> I want to say good night to the Levines before we go.<br> Honey, stop.<br> It's not that bad.<br> Your dad must have added wrong.<br> He only tipped 4%%% .<br> Yeah.<br> That's Daddy.<br> "That's Daddy"? Doesn't it bother you? You' re a waitress.<br> Yes, it bothers me.<br> If he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.<br> -So? -So, Ross.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I've bugged him about this a million times.<br> He won't change.<br> Do you really serve people sneezers? Well, I don't.<br> All right, kids.<br> Ready? Thanks again, Dr.<br> Greene.<br> Wait, I think I forgot my receipt.<br> -You don't need that.<br> -Why not? The carbon.<br> It's messy.<br> I mean, gets on your fingers and causes.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>night blindness.<br> What is this? Who put a 20 down here? Oh, yeah, that would be me.<br> I have a problem.<br> I tip way too much.<br> Way too much.<br> -It's a sickness, really.<br> -Yeah, it is.<br> -We have to do something about that.<br> -Excuse me.<br> You think I' m cheap? He didn't mean anything by that.<br> He really didn't.<br> Nothing I do means anything.<br> Really.<br> This is nice.<br> I pay $200 for dinner.<br> You put down $20 and you come out looking like Mr.<br> Big Shot.<br> You really want to be Mr.<br> Big Shot? Here.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> You pay the whole bill, Mr.<br> Big Shot.<br> All right? Well, "Mr.<br> Big Shot" is better than "Wet-Head.<br> " Okay, some tricks of the trade.<br> Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so if I have to cry.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I cut a hole in my pocket.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>take a pair of tweezers.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and just start pulling.<br> Or let's say I want to convey.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I've just done something evil.<br> That would be your basic I've-got-a- fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-l-like-it.<br> Let's say I've just gotten bad news.<br> Well, all I do there is try and divide 232 by 1 3.<br> And that's how it's done.<br> Great soap opera acting tonight, everybody.<br> Class dismissed.<br> Hey, Mr.<br> Trib.<br> Guess what? I got an audition! One of my students got an audition.<br> I' m so proud! I was wondering if you'd coach me for it.<br> You bet! What's the part? Oh, it's great! It's a role on All My Children.<br> Nick the boxer.<br> You couldn't leave it alone.<br> Four percent, okay? I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.<br> Tonight was about the two of you getting along.<br> Would you just see my chiropractor already? I' m gonna go to a doctor who went to medical school in a mini-mall.<br> Hey, Pheebs.<br> What are you doing? I' m freaking out! Monica trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you.<br> Does Monica still turn the lights on in her room? I am so dead! Look, here's the bottom line.<br> This is fixable if we act fast, okay? I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow, and you can make nice.<br> Honey, I have tried to make nice.<br> It doesn't work.<br> Look, I realize my father is difficult.<br> But that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.<br> Sweetie, I could be the bigger man.<br> I could be the biggest man.<br> I could be a huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make a difference.<br> Except I could pick your father up and say, "Like me! Like me, tiny doctor! " Can't you just try it one more time? For me? For me? One brunch is not gonna solve anything.<br> Face it.<br> We' re never gonna get along.<br> Well, you are just going to have to.<br> I've already got a mother and father who cannot stay in the same room.<br> I don't want to have a separate room for you too! I'll get the bagels.<br> What's this? Isn't it cool? This is not the bed I ordered.<br> I know! You must have won a contest or something.<br> Why is this car in my bedroom? I' m sorry.<br> I wasn't looking.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and the store won't take it back, because you signed for it.<br> -When did I sign for it? -When I was you.<br> It's all Joey's fault, because he left his nose open! Did you make brownies today? Knock, knock! Quick! Take off your dress.<br> He won't notice the bed.<br> I' m going for sushi.<br> Does anybody want--? Somebody missed the off-ramp! It's Monica's bed.<br> What? It's a racecar! This has always been Monica's bed.<br> You just noticed? How self-involved are you? If this bed isn't new, then how come there's plastic on the mattress? Sometimes I have bad dreams.<br> Look.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I just saw my best friend's brain smeared across the canvas.<br> It's not gonna be me.<br> Not me.<br> That was good.<br> That was-- Tweezers? -That was really good.<br> -Thanks.<br> Any suggestions? You told him to play the boxer gay? I might have said.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> "super-gay.<br> " You totally screwed him over.<br> You' re this guy's teacher.<br> How could you do this? Because the guy's so good.<br> And I really, really want this part.<br> Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.<br> -Hi, Daddy.<br> -Baby.<br> Dr.<br> Greene, how are you? Thanks for dinner last night.<br> Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.<br> Nice hair.<br> What did you do, swim here? That's it.<br> I can't take it anymore.<br> What? He likes your hair and just wants to know how you got here.<br> -It's hopeless.<br> I' m just gonna go.<br> -What? -I' m sorry.<br> It's just-- -Ross? What's with the neck? I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor.<br> You still going to him? He couldn't get into med school in lxtapa! Thank you.<br> That's what I keep saying.<br> Excuse me, Dr.<br> Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.<br> Wait a minute.<br> His name is Dr.<br> Bobby? -That's his last name.<br> -And his first name.<br> He's Bobby Bobby? It's Robert Bobby.<br> And excuse me.<br> He helps me.<br> -Please.<br> Ask her how? -What do you need help for? My alignment.<br> One leg's shorter than the other.<br> -Oh, my God.<br> -Argue with that.<br> My right leg is two inches shorter! Come on, you' re just tilting! -Her legs are fine.<br> -I know that.<br> -So why do you let her go to him? -"Let her"? She doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance, either.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You don't have renter's insurance? How you gonna run after a thief, with one leg shorter than the other? -Would you like some juice? -I'd love some juice.<br> This is going so well! Did you see us? Did you see? Yeah, honey.<br> I was standing right there.<br> Why don't you tell him about my mole? Excellent! There will come a time in each of your careers.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.<br> I had such an opportunity in the recent present.<br> And I' m ashamed to say.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I took it.<br> I advised a fellow actor to play a role.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>homosexually.<br> We both auditioned for the part.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and as it turned out.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> They liked the stupid "gay" thing and cast him.<br> And now.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he's got a two-year contract.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>opposite Susan Lucci.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the first lady of daytime television.<br> And me? Me, I' m stuck here teaching a bunch of people.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>most of whom are too ugly to even be on Tv.<br> I' m sorry.<br> I' m sorry.<br> Thank you.<br> -May I help you? -Yes, hi.<br> I' m the lady who got stuck with the racecar bed.<br> Look, it's like I told you.<br> There's nothing I can do.<br> You signed for it.<br> "Monica Felula Geller.<br> " All right, we wanna see the King.<br> Nobody sees the King.<br> Okay.<br> I' m talking to the King.<br> Hey, you can't go back there! Oh, my God.<br> Hey, watch it, lady! Hey, good-looking.<br> All right, I'll leave.<br> My bed's so boring.<br>   <br>
