It's our new alumni website for college.<br> You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.<br> Oh, great.<br> A faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless.<br> It's actually interesting to find out what people are doing.<br> Remember Andrea Rich? That tall girl that wouldn't sleep with you? Well, her Internet company went under, and she lost an ear in a boating accident.<br> Bet she'd sleep with you now.<br> No, I already e-mailed her.<br> Let me see what you wrote about yourself.<br> "Doctor of paleontology, two kids.<br>" Wait a second.<br> You split with Carol because you had different interests? I think you split with Carol because you had one very similar interest.<br> I'm gonna finish this later, okay? Let me just grab my coat.<br> Okay! What, did you think you learned how to do it in the last two minutes? Maybe we finish this for him.<br> Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.<br> She is now my girlfriend.<br> I don't care what society says, it's the best sex I've ever had.<br> - And send.<br> - No, no You can't do that to him.<br> - All right, let's go.<br> - Dude! I think you made it clear you can't be trusted with the ball inside the house.<br> And send.<br> The One With the Memorial Service mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Hey.<br> How was basketball? It was fun.<br> Right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye.<br> Oh, no! Who did that? Chandler.<br> Yeah.<br> Hey! - Rach? - Yeah? What's Huggsy doing in the crib with Emma? She was just crawling around and found him, so I just let her sleep with him.<br> - That's all right, isn't it? - Of course.<br> Yeah.<br> It's a stuffed animal, you know? It's for kids.<br> Not for adults.<br> I know that.<br> Joey, you're sure? I mean, I know how much you love him.<br> Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay? I do not love Huggsy.<br> I like him a normal amount.<br> All right.<br> Well, Emma loves him.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person! - Hi.<br> - Hey, Phoebe.<br> How you doing? - You feeling better? - Breaking up sucks.<br> - Oh, I really miss Mike.<br> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> I've tried everything to feel better.<br> I even tried writing a song about it but I can't think of anything that rhymes with: Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need your help getting through this.<br> You're saying you're not gonna need my help? No.<br> When I get to the point where I'm ready to hear cruel, mocking jokes about Mike, I'm gonna come to you.<br> Oh, good, because I've already thought of three.<br> Four! I just thought of a fourth! Okay.<br> I mean, I know I did the right thing.<br> Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future.<br> But pretty soon, I'm gonna miss him so much I'm gonna want to see him again, and you have to stop me.<br> Okay, you got it.<br> Unless Am I being too crazy about this? All right, so there's no future.<br> But that doesn't mean we still can't have fun.<br> - You know what? Forget what I said.<br> - Really? - All right, if that's what you want.<br> - That was a test, and you just failed.<br> Damn it! Rookie mistake! I have sex with dinosaurs? I believe I read that somewhere.<br> Not only is it not funny, it's physically impossible! Okay? Depending on the species, I'd have to have a 6-foot-long It's not funny! I respectfully disagree.<br> I can't believe you put that on my alumni page.<br> - Who cares? Nobody reads those.<br> - You better hope not because I just read what you put on your page.<br> - I don't have a page.<br> - Oh, I respectfully disagree! "Look at you.<br> All sweet and innocent", sleeping like an angel.<br> With Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around you.<br> It's okay, Emma.<br> You stay asleep.<br> Step away from the crib! I have a weapon! It's okay! It's okay, Rach! It's me! Put down the scrunchie.<br> - What are you doing? - Well, I heard Emma stirring so I came in to make sure she could reach Huggsy.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> All right, well, now that I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.<br> Okay, there you go, sweetie.<br> This isn't over! Wait a second.<br> Why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are "as gay as the day is long"? Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.<br> Well, that's clearly a joke.<br> This could easily be true.<br> Would you get that, please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.<br> Hello? No, he's not here.<br> Yeah, this is his wife.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, it came as quite a shock to me too! Well, I guess I should've known.<br> He just kept making me watch "Moulin Rouge.<br>" Hang up! Hang up! And that was a great movie.<br> I'm so gonna get back at Ross.<br> Oh, yeah, this'll show him.<br> Here we go.<br> - What are you doing? - Oh, you'll see, my friend! I'm dead? And so young.<br> Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.<br> Well, how you died was funny.<br> Oh, please.<br> Hit by a blimp? It kills over one Americans every year.<br> Unbelievable.<br> My classmates are gonna think I'm dead.<br> My professors.<br> My parents are gonna get phone calls! You're messing with people's feelings here.<br> You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt Professor Stern was when I told him I wouldn't be able to go to Key West! You've really crossed a line here.<br> But that's okay.<br> Because I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn.<br> That's right.<br> Your coming-out is about to get real graphic! God, I wish Mike were here.<br> Okay, if Mike were here, what would the two of you be doing? What are you, animals? It's 4:00 in the afternoon.<br> I gotta call him.<br> Just to talk to him.<br> There's no harm in that.<br> That's how it starts.<br> "I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing.<br> Why not just a little sliver?" Or, "Okay, just a slice or two.<br>" The next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide! Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.<br> But look, if you talk to him, then you're gonna want to see him.<br> And if you see him, you're gonna wanna get back together.<br> And I know that's not what you want.<br> All right, so give me your phone.<br> Here.<br> - And now your cell.<br> - Okay.<br> There you go.<br> - This is your cell phone? - Yes.<br> This is your current cell phone? Yes.<br> It reminds me of a simpler time.<br> Phoebe? Where's your purse? - Hey! No! - No! - Give it to me! - You can't have it! - Give it to me! - No! - I'll go in there! - Oh, yeah.<br> - Phoebe, come here! - No! - Give it to me! - You're crazy! Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing! Hey, look who's here.<br> It's Joey.<br> And he brought home a friend.<br> Emma's right here.<br> You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day! No, no, no, it's not a girl.<br> It's a brand-new Huggsy! Oh! Oh, that's so great! Now Emma has two Huggsies! No, no.<br> Oh, no.<br> No, Emma has one Huggsy.<br> The new Huggsy.<br> The other Huggsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take him back.<br> You know what? When I was a little girl, I had a little pink pony named Cotton.<br> Oh, I loved her so much.<br> I took her everywhere.<br> I would braid her tail Make the transfer! Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Huggsy and I can't find it? No, don't worry about it.<br> I swallowed that years ago.<br> Hey! Oh, what? I don't think she likes the new Huggsy.<br> - But he's the same.<br> - I think she wants the old one back.<br> - Yeah, but he's the same.<br> - Joey, come on.<br> But he's the same! You're not the same.<br> You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.<br> So, Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door? Those are my shoes.<br> Well, when you get over this breakup, we need to go shopping.<br> Look, Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me.<br> - But I'm actually feeling a lot better.<br> - You are? Yeah, I just kind of want to be alone right now.<br> - Who's that? - I ordered Chinese food.<br> What are the chances?! One billion Chinese people, and they send Mike! - What are you doing here? - Phoebe called me.<br> - Phoebe! - I'm sorry.<br> I broke down.<br> I wanted to see him.<br> Damn it, Phoebe, how did you even call him? There's a speakerphone on the base unit.<br> Base unit.<br> Think, Monica, think! - Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she - This doesn't concern you! Sorry.<br> I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name.<br> Look, guys, you can't do this.<br> It's gonna make getting over each other harder.<br> Not if nothing happens.<br> Why can't we just hang out as friends? Sure.<br> If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join you.<br> You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend.<br> Sit down.<br> Make room for your friend.<br> - So how have you been? - I've been pretty good.<br> - You look really beautiful.<br> - Thanks.<br> You look good too.<br> No, no, no.<br> This is dangerous territory.<br> Keep it clean.<br> So how's the piano playing going? Actually, I've been playing a lot of love songs lately.<br> - I've missed you.<br> - I've missed you too.<br> You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up.<br> And then a pigeon ate it.<br> Hey.<br> Ross.<br> Look, I just wanted to apologize.<br> Don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me.<br> Check this out.<br> So that's what I'd look like if I worked out.<br> And was being serviced by a policeman.<br> You're not gonna actually send these out, are you? Actually, I don't need to, because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work.<br> Okay? There were no responses.<br> Nobody posted anything, nobody called my parents, so the joke is on you.<br> Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - Nobody cares that I'm dead? - Oh, come on, you know that's not true.<br> What are you talking about? You get 60 responses just for coming out of the closet.<br> I didn't get one response, and I'm dead! Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.<br> I can't believe this.<br> Not even my geology lab partner.<br> And I carried that guy! Look, let's think about this, okay? You think people are gonna disturb your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This isn't about people not caring.<br> This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.<br> - You're right.<br> There isn't a decent outlet.<br> - Right.<br> I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial service, tons of people would come.<br> Exactly! Ross, what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself? No, that would be stupid.<br> You're having it for me.<br> - Ross, don't press send.<br> Don't press - No, too late.<br> Too late.<br> It's sent.<br> Sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.<br> I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.<br> Have you seen Huggsy? Original or crappy? - Original.<br> - No.<br> Sorry.<br> Haven't seen him.<br> Then what's that big lump under your covers? - It's Monica, okay? - That's not Monica! All right, fine! It's original Huggsy! I know Emma wants him, but he's mine and I need him.<br> She's being unreasonable.<br> Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much! Oh, don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her Uncle Joey.<br> - It does? - Yeah.<br> And she's comforted by him because she loves her Uncle Joey so much.<br> - Really? She loves me? - Oh, yeah.<br> But you know what? If you need Huggsy, don't worry.<br> Emma will totally understand.<br> I won't, but whatever.<br> Okay, wait a minute, Rach.<br> I mean, if If Huggsy means that much to Emma, then Well, she can have him.<br> Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey would step up.<br> - Look, Emma.<br> Look who's back.<br> - No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it! Are you? You're gonna take Huggsy away from a little child? How do you think I got him in the first place? All right, you two.<br> I'm gonna go to the bathroom.<br> I don't want anything going on while I'm gone.<br> Here's a few things you can discuss: Mucus, fungus, and the idea of me and Ross doing it.<br> I've missed you so much.<br> I won't ask you to get back together.<br> I know we want different things, but - Just to be with you one more night.<br> - I want that too.<br> - But is that gonna make it too hard? - It can't be any harder than this.<br> I mean, if I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, l I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you moved.<br> Everything about you.<br> If I had known the last time I kissed you would be the last time I never would have stopped.<br> Kiss him, you fool! - What? - Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him, then I will.<br> I missed you so much.<br> - I knew you'd be here! - Crap.<br> - Who is this? - My friend Manny.<br> I asked him to keep me away from you.<br> - Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.<br> - Well, you're not doing a very good job.<br> - Excuse me? - What's with the kissing? Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.<br> Yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing.<br> - You didn't hear the speech.<br> - I've heard the speech.<br> If he knew it was gonna be the last time Hey, it was very moving.<br> You're just heartless! - You're weak! - You're weird! Your pants are undone.<br> Where'd they go? - Damn it.<br> - Well, we blew it.<br> I blame myself.<br> And I blame you too.<br> It's been an hour, and not one of my classmates has shown up? I tell you, when I actually die, some people are gonna get seriously haunted.<br> There you go.<br> Someone came.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> I'm gonna go hide.<br> This is so exciting.<br> My first mourner! Hi.<br> Glad you could come.<br> - Please come in.<br> - Hi.<br> You're Chandler Bing, right? - I'm Tom Gordon.<br> I was in your class.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> Yes, let me take your coat.<br> Thanks.<br> I'm so sorry about Ross, it's No, at least he died doing what he loved.<br> Watching blimps.<br> - Who is it? - You know some guy, Tom Gordon? I don't remember him.<br> But then again, I touched so many lives.<br> So did you know Ross well? Actually, I barely knew him.<br> I came because I heard Chandler's news.<br> Do you know if he's seeing anyone? - Yes, he is.<br> Me.<br> - What? You mean? Can I ask you a personal question? How do you shave your beard so close? Okay, Tommy! That's enough mourning for you.<br> Here we go.<br> Bye-bye.<br> All right.<br> - Hey, listen.<br> Call me.<br> - Okay.<br> - I'm dead and no one cares? - I look like a man? Please, one ridiculous problem at a time.<br> This isn't ridiculous.<br> Look around, no one's here.<br> You gave them one day's notice.<br> Not everyone checks the website every day.<br> And Monica, it's probably the way you stand! I guess you're right.<br> Still, somebody must have seen it.<br> I went to that school for four years and I didn't have an impact on anyone? Well, that's not true.<br> You had an impact on me.<br> I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends.<br> Doesn't that count for something? Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.<br> I'm sure it's somebody for you.<br> Now go hide.<br> Hi.<br> I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.<br> - Kori? Kori Weston? - Yeah.<br> - You look amazing.<br> - And you are? Chandler.<br> Chandler Bing.<br> And I'm not gay.<br> I'm not gay at all.<br> You are married, though.<br> Don't listen to him.<br> He's in a really bad mood.<br> I can't believe that Ross is gone.<br> It is just so sad.<br> I didn't know Ross and you were so close.<br> Oh, we weren't.<br> But we had one class together.<br> He was such a great guy.<br> And he talked so passionately about science.<br> - I always remembered him.<br> - I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.<br> And if heaven has a door I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.<br> I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.<br> I guess I really missed my chance.<br> No, you didn't! I'm still alive! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.<br> It's a long story.<br> But the things you just said really made my day.<br> The fact that you're here means more to me than if this room were filled with people.<br> You sick freak! Who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you.<br> Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me! No, Mom, I am not dead.<br> I know it's not something to kid about.<br> It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, okay? Actually, no.<br> Even if I had died, you would not be left childless.<br> Monica?   <br>
