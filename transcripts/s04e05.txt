I'm out on a limb here! I'm sorry.<br> You're right.<br> But I should tell you, I'm waiting for a date.<br> And there he is now! I see you guys already met.<br> I was trying to demonstrate how I could get my very large feet into my even bigger mouth.<br> Didn't I tell you? Always showing off.<br> Before I start, I want to say that I have a cold.<br> So if I sneeze during a song, it's not on purpose.<br> Except the last verse of "Pepper People.<br>" Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good.<br> Smelly cat Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.<br> At 2:30 a.<br>m.<br>, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.<br> Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs thing I wanted to watch.<br> That's why I got up too.<br> You're kidding? I love him! My dad made me stay up and watch reruns with him.<br> Mine too.<br> Did your dad also make you watch the Mr.<br> Universe contest? -No.<br> -Well, me neither.<br> I'm sorry about this afternoon.<br> If I had known that you two, I never would have.<br> Oh, please.<br> Joey tells me you two met in acting class.<br> They teamed us up as partners.<br> Joey picked three scenes for us to do.<br> All of them had us making out.<br> That's a good thing because he used to make me rehearse with him.<br> -ls it on? -No, but this Wonder Broom is amazing! Oh, my God! It's on! Here we go, little fella.<br> What about the duck? The duck can swim.<br> My sticky shoes My sticky, sticky shoes Why you stick on me? Baby Thanks for the lights, honey.<br> Way to go! Your cold makes you sound great.<br> It's fun.<br> God, I love how sexy I am! Kath, we should get going.<br> We're going to buy hamsters.<br> I love them.<br> No, it's not like that.<br> I work for a medical researcher.<br> -Well, have fun.<br> -Okay.<br> It's nice that the medical community is trying to help sick hamsters.<br> -lsn't it? -Yeah, it's great.<br> You know what? I like Kathy.<br> Me too! She's so cool and pretty.<br> She is.<br> She's smart and funny.<br> We were up all last night talking.<br> She said the funniest thing about What? You love her.<br> No, I don't.<br> Yes, you do.<br> Chandler loves Kathy.<br> -Come on, just lay off him.<br> -Thank you.<br> He's a little sensitive right now because he's so in love! All right.<br> Kathy, I love you! I need to write some depressing stuff to go with my new bluesy voice.<br> But nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.<br> How about your mom dying? Or having to live on the streets when you were 14? I could write about the time my hair did that whoo-hoo thing.<br> I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.<br> Rachel's not here.<br> How's it going with her? Great, actually.<br> I'm thinking tonight may be the night.<br> The kids are gonna play together, and then when they're asleep I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine do a little playing ourselves.<br> Hi, guys! This is Josh.<br> Josh, these are my friends.<br> And that's Ross.<br> Dudes.<br> You played in college? I still do.<br> Next year, I hope to make varsity.<br> Didn't you play soccer in high school? No, wait.<br> You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.<br> It's getting late.<br> I gotta get to the game, so I'm gonnahead.<br> I'll miss you.<br> Dope! Wow! Cute one.<br> -Very cute.<br> -I know.<br> Isn't he great? So nice to finally be in a fun relationship, you know? There's nothing boring about him.<br> I bet he's never set foot in a museum.<br> Maybe he'll get to go soon.<br> Like on a class trip or something.<br> You know what else is great about him? What is the word for an adult who doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom? What was that? Monica knows.<br> It's this dumb thing that Ross made up to try to fool our parents.<br> It's a way of giving the finger without actually having to give it.<br> I cried the night you made that up.<br> It was the first time I realized I was cooler than my big brother.<br> I'm going to go get ready for my date tonight so I'll just "head.<br>" I should go too.<br> I'm playing in one hour.<br> You guys should come hear me.<br> Hear me.<br> My sticky shoes I lost my sexy phlegm! Hi, Ben.<br> -You look great! -Thanks.<br> Hey, Tommy! I am so glad that you could come over tonight.<br> Oh, no.<br> It's my pleasure.<br> My cell phone number is here on the counter.<br> Please, help yourself to anything in the fridge.<br> I appreciate this so much.<br> I have been trying to go out with this guy for a month.<br> I'd really appreciate it if you'd wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep.<br> I blocked the adult channels for the other babysitters, but the code is four, three I'm fine.<br> Thanks for this.<br> I hope I can do the same for you sometime.<br> Who wants to make some long-distance calls? Kathy! Kathy! Hi! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Chandler, what are you doing here? I just wanted to say, "Hey!" Hey.<br> Okay.<br> You're making it sound worse than it was.<br> Her date tipped me $10! What are you doing? I want to be sexy again, so I'm trying to catch a cold.<br> Should be easy.<br> They're pretty common.<br> You'll catch pneumonia! Okay, you were right.<br> I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.<br> -What? -Are you serious? How is that possible? You barely know her.<br> I don't know.<br> I just I can't get her out of my head.<br> I'm a very bad person.<br> I'm a very, very bad person.<br> I'm a horrible person.<br> "No, you're not.<br> We still love you, Chandler!" Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.<br> You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that! We were just talking about you.<br> Really? The time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.<br> Right in there! -What movie did you get? -I got what I always get.<br> Die Hard.<br> That's what I like about Joey.<br> Any other guy would have been: "Yeah, The English Patient is my favorite movie too.<br>" But Joey goes, "No way.<br> Let's get Die Hard.<br> I'm not watching that English crap.<br>" Yeah, he's dreamy.<br> I gotta go.<br> I gotta go meet some friends.<br> He has other friends? Ninety-nine a hundred.<br> Ready or not, here I come! Let's go over the concept one more time.<br> You want to get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight? You know what? I already ate.<br> It's 4:30.<br> I had a big meal on Monday.<br> So that'll get me straight through the week.<br> I see what's going on here.<br> -You do? -Yeah.<br> You don't like Kathy.<br> You got me.<br> You've been avoiding her ever since we started going out.<br> I made an effort to like Janice.<br> Now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out with us.<br> Right? -Yeah, right.<br> -Good.<br> And hey, my treat.<br> -Only because you're not eating, right? -Right.<br> Sorry, Grandma.<br> Ross isn't here.<br> Stop it! I'll see you at the party? Beer's fear, man! Twenty-four, seven! I am so gonna marry that guy.<br> What? -I think he's stealing from me.<br> -Why? Because he's stealing from me! Hi, it's me and soup.<br> I just saw Josh.<br> He looked so yummy in your leather jacket.<br> I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup.<br> There's no chicken in the broth, so it's really just noodle water.<br> -Thank you so much.<br> -Sure.<br> What are you doing? I need your germs.<br> I want my cold back.<br> I miss my sexy voice.<br> Sorry, Phoebe.<br> It's okay.<br> How's the soup? Check it out! You can see that girl's underwear.<br> Is she great, or what? What do you think? She's not really my type.<br> Not your type? She's gorgeous.<br> You know what it is? The fishnet stockings.<br> Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings, it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.<br> Understanding a little more of why you're single.<br> I have a friend you'd like.<br> She's really pretty.<br> And then we could double date.<br> No, thanks.<br> I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.<br> I'm gonna grab a beer.<br> I'll be right back.<br> -What was that? -What? Kathy's being really nice and you just walked away.<br> What do you want from me? I want you to like her.<br> If that's too damn difficult for you, then the least you could do is pretend.<br> -I am pretending.<br> -Then do it better.<br> What do you say I go over there and tell her how much I like her? I can tell her how much I've been thinking of her.<br> I haven't stopped thinking about her since we met.<br> I'm so over the top, want-to-slit-my-own-throat in love with her that for every minute I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first! That's pretty good.<br> But you might want to tone it down a little.<br> I still have a fever? Are you sure that thing's working right? Well, we could take it the other way.<br> So Amanda just dropped me off.<br> That's one of the things I love about her.<br> She's old enough to drive.<br> You're not going to Mom and Dad's tonight? No, sorry.<br> Where's Amanda? Could you get me some cough drops? I'm thinking you could bring her and you guys could go up to your old room and not make out.<br> Cough drop, please? At least she's not going out with me to get into R-rated movies.<br> Why don't you just marry her? Wait, you can't! I forgot.<br> She's not a lesbian.<br> -Amanda and I have a -You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her babysitter.<br> You have a 12-year-old girl's job! That is so sad.<br> And what are you laughing at, Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend -is-stealing-from-me? So he stole a couple bucks from me.<br> Big deal! At least he got me something with it.<br> That's mine! Would you both please start acting like adults? And give me my cough drops! -Fine.<br> -Sorry.<br> Here.<br> Thank you.<br> At least I made $10 in my relationship.<br> You know? Parading goats are parading Parading down the street Parading goats are parading Leaving little treats Does it even work without my sexy voice? I like it.<br> -Gunther, kiss me.<br> -What? Do it, deputy! Do something! We aren't exactly sleeping in here, but do you mind? Can I sleep on your couch? And I'm still waiting For my papier-mache man Thank you, my babies.<br> Rachel? Did you hear what happened between me and Phoebe? We kissed.<br> I didn't initiate it, but I also didn't stop it.<br> I've been feeling guilty.<br> Okay.<br> So are we cool? Okay.<br> I knew you would understand.<br>   <br>
