                    			Chandler, Mon, there's only one banana-nut muffin left.<br> I ordered mine first.<br> Yeah, but I'm so much faster.<br> Give it to me.<br> No.<br> Give it to me! Okay, you can have it.<br> There you go.<br> Enjoy your coffee.<br> That was there when I got here.<br> Hey, you'll never guess who's coming to New York.<br> Quick, tell us before he swallows.<br> Ryan, that guy I dated who's in the Navy.<br> You went out with a guy in the Navy? I met him while playing guitar in the park.<br> Ryan threw in saltwater taffy because he didn't have change.<br> Is that when you wrote "Saltwater Taffy Man"? No, he's my submarine guy.<br> He resurfaces every couple years and we have an amazing three days together.<br> Only this time, he's coming for 2 weeks.<br> Two whole weeks, which means "yea"! So this guy goes down for, like, two years at a time? That'll teach you to lick my muffin.<br> Hi.<br> Oh, no.<br> What happened? I just spoke to Carol.<br> Ben's got chickenpox.<br> Oh, no.<br> Yeah, so if you haven't had it, chances are you'll get it.<br> -I've had it.<br> -I've had it.<br> -Had it.<br> -Had it.<br> I've never had it.<br> I feel so left out.<br> Oh, look! The One With the Chicken Pox Honey, you made the bed again.<br> I told you, you don't have to do that.<br> This isn't camp.<br> Then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.<br> I'm taking a shower.<br> Today I'll sing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown.<br>" Hey, Mon, I have a question.<br> Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man? The baddest.<br> Otherwise, the song would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown.<br>" What are you doing? I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.<br> Are you remaking the bed? I'm sorry.<br> The way you did it, it was just fine.<br> Then you're redoing it because? You'll think I'm crazy.<br> You're pretty much running that risk either way.<br> Okay.<br> You see the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner it should be at the bottom right corner.<br> -That's not so crazy.<br> -I'm just easing you in.<br> All right.<br> You see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up not down because the head of the bed is where the sun would be.<br> You don't love me anymore, do you? Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.<br> Really? Wow.<br> Well, then, come on! I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.<br> If you need something to hold you over I can get you a job here as an entry-level processor.<br> Don't you need experience like this? It's not hard to learn.<br> As for people realizing you don't know what you're doing, you're an actor.<br> Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.<br> Here's this morning's projections.<br> Thanks.<br> Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.<br> Joey is a fellow processor.<br> No kidding? I process.<br> People want the processing, I'm the one they call.<br> -Where do you work? -Well, I'm in between things.<br> You know, one day you're processing, the next day you're not so much processing anymore.<br> I told Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.<br> Fleischman's group.<br> Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches.<br> Are all you processors dorks? This lipstick looks just great on you.<br> You look fabulous.<br> You really do.<br> Yeah, are you sure? Really? See, you look beautiful.<br> For God sakes, dim the lights.<br> I'm hideous! It's gonna be okay.<br> Ryan's been underwater.<br> He's just gonna be glad you don't have barnacles on your butt.<br> Come in.<br> Hey, baby, I'm back Hey, Ryan.<br> What's up? What's going on? No, no.<br> You have to stay back.<br> I have the pox! Chicken or small? Chicken, which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.<br> -Why aren't you home in bed? -My grandmother's never had chickenpox.<br> Please tell me you have, because oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.<br> I'm sorry, I never had them.<br> If I had one wish, I'd go back to when I was 7 when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox, and rub that kid all over my face.<br> Yeah, or you could wish that I didn't have them now.<br> Can I please see your face? No.<br> You don't wanna see a face covered with pox.<br> It could be lox, I wouldn't care.<br> And you hate fish.<br> So sweet.<br> All right.<br> Okay, all right.<br> You can see.<br> This is me.<br> Sorry! I am scary! The lightening was an unfortunate coincidence.<br> You look lovely! Lovely! I hate this.<br> I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us.<br> And everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.<br> I've spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men thinking about this moment.<br> I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.<br> Okay.<br> This is the most romantic disease I've ever had.<br> -How's the first day? -Good.<br> It's like you said.<br> It's putting numbers from one column into another.<br> There you go.<br> And everybody's nice.<br> I just had a good talk with that lady Jeannie.<br> Jeannie? The head of East Coast operations, Jeannie? Turns out our kids go to the same school.<br> Yeah.<br> Small world, huh? Weird world.<br> Your kids? I figure my character has kids.<br> There isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.<br> When you're acting, you need to think about that stuff.<br> My character, Joseph the processing guy  has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.<br> Ashley copies everything Brittany does.<br> Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.<br> You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.<br> You know what? Just did.<br> That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.<br> You Know what makes the itching worse? That you don't stop talking about it? -Fine.<br> -Let's just play, okay? Good, okay.<br> Here we go, double sixes.<br> Here we go.<br> Here we go.<br> Come to Mama.<br> Getting ready to roll the dice.<br> What are you doing? Are you scratching? No.<br> This is what I do for luck, okay? You're scratching.<br> Give me the dice.<br> -Give me the dice.<br> -No! Here.<br> There! Look, double sixes! We can't scratch.<br> We'll scar.<br> I can't stop thinking about it.<br> It's just so hard.<br> I wanna grab these houses and rub them all over my body.<br> -No! -Give it! Come on! You know you want it.<br> You know you want it too.<br> Let's just be bad.<br> It'll feel so good.<br> Come on.<br> Oh, God, help me.<br> -Oh, yeah.<br> -Okay, good.<br> Now do me.<br> Do my back.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Harder! There you go.<br> -Don't move.<br> -Why? -Don't move.<br> -What are you? Stop that.<br> Stop that right now.<br> I might've expected this of Phoebe.<br> But, Ryan, you're a military man.<br> She make me doing.<br> -That's a nice color on you.<br> -You will become pink and blunch baby.<br> I hope you get a Winnie pork.<br> You and Milton have to join us on the boat.<br> Bring the kids.<br> We'll make a day of it.<br> That sounds lovely.<br> We'll have to set it up.<br> I better get back.<br> Hope the baby feels better.<br> Thanks.<br> -Bye-bye, Jeannie.<br> -Bye-bye, Joseph.<br> What a phony.<br> You'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing.<br> -Hey, Mr.<br> Douglas.<br> -Sir.<br> Bing, I got your memo.<br> We're not gonna see the report until next Friday? My group wants to spend the holiday with family.<br> I have a family.<br> I'm gonna be here.<br> Yeah, Bing.<br> What's that about? It's about cutting them a little slack for morale.<br> Look, I can get some rough numbers by Wednesday.<br> Rough numbers? This company wasn't built on rough numbers.<br> Right, Mr.<br> Douglas? Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.<br> If you say so, sir.<br> Joseph's good, isn't he? I'm going to kill you.<br> Hey, I just figured Joseph's the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.<br> You know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.<br> Why? Look, I'm sorry, but that's what Joseph does.<br> Okay? If you try to pull something  he'll call you on it.<br> "What are you trying to pull?" he'll say.<br> Duct tape.<br> Was I supposed to bring something too? This is for the scratchy twins.<br> I taped oven mitts to their hands.<br> You're strict.<br> Well, it's for their own good.<br> You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.<br> See, in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.<br> Exactly! God, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.<br> Tell me the truth.<br> Don't you like having everything on your desk perpendicular? If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.<br> -Very good.<br> -Thank you.<br> Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.<br> You're gonna do what to my clocks? Set them to my time.<br> I'm confused.<br> I thought we shared time.<br> No.<br> See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.<br> Wanna know why? Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen? Forget it.<br> No, come on, tell me.<br> -You don't understand.<br> -Come on.<br> You don't have any obsessive things.<br> No, that's not true.<br> Oh, yeah? Tell me one of yours.<br> One of my things is I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.<br> What if they get mixed up? Boy, I would just.<br> I would freak out.<br> You would not.<br> I can't believe this.<br> I hate this.<br> You're too normal.<br> I can't believe you don't have a "thing.<br>" My boyfriend doesn't have a "thing.<br>" See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.<br> -Mr.<br> Douglas is looking for you.<br> -Why is Mr.<br> Douglas looking for me? He suspects you dropped the ball on the Lender project.<br> Why? Why does he suspect that? At first, he thought it was Joseph but after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you.<br> -Anyway, I thought you should know.<br> -All right.<br> That's it.<br> Look, Joey  I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you and if I could just fire Joseph, I would.<br> But that's not possible.<br> So I have to let you both go.<br> What? Everybody loves Joseph.<br> I don't.<br> I hate Joseph.<br> I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.<br> You can't fire Joseph.<br> He's not in your department.<br> All right, okay.<br> So I can't fire Joseph  but I can sleep with his wife.<br> Not Karen! Yeah, I'm thinking about having an affair with her.<br> You know what? I just did.<br> What the hell are you doing? Oh, it's not me.<br> It's my character! Chandie.<br> The rogue processor who seduces his coworkers' wives and then laughs about it.<br> In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer! -Really? -No, freak show, she's fictional! Take it easy.<br> If it means that much to you, I'll go find something else.<br> Thank you.<br> It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.<br> I liked him.<br> His wife.<br> She was hot.<br> And the kids, you gonna put a pour like summer.<br> Please take these off.<br> I swear I won't scratch.<br> No, sorry, hon.<br> Monica's orders.<br> Well, that wasn't easy.<br> Okay, dinner's on.<br> There's a peach cobbler warming in the oven.<br> So the plate's gonna be hot, but that shouldn't be a problem for you.<br> All right, you kids.<br> Bye, now.<br> -Bye.<br> -Oh, look, look.<br> A low-budget puppet show.<br> A shame you can't see what finger I'm holding up.<br> -Wine? -Please.<br> -Spilled some.<br> -I got it.<br> You look beautiful tonight.<br> What? Sorry.<br> You look beautiful.<br> You know what? That's it.<br> That's it.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Good.<br> You guys, did you? Monica wake up.<br> What's up? I thought of a thing.<br> Yeah? I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.<br> No.<br> You have to sleep on this side of the bed  because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.<br> Or so I would have you believe.<br> So you have a side of the bed.<br> Everybody has a side of the bed.<br> Hey, come on.<br> You haven't heard my reason yet.<br> All right, go on.<br> I have to sleep on the west side  because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.<br> Oh, my God.<br> You're a freak! How about that? Where're you shipping off to? I really can't say.<br> Do you have nuclear weapons onboard? I can't say.<br> Do you get to look through a periscope thingy? I'm sorry, but I can't say.<br> Wow, it's neat learning about submarines.<br> -I better not miss my flight.<br> -I'll walk you out.<br> -Bye, Ryan.<br> -Pleasure.<br> Take care.<br> So do you think we could get you one of those uniform things? You like that, do you? Oh, yeah.<br> I'll make some calls.<br> Can you believe that's how we spent our two weeks? We didn't do the romantic things I'd planned Iike having a picnic in Central Park and coffee at Central Perk.<br> Oh, I just got that! Taxi! Bye, you.<br> I'm sorry, we're Hey, sailor.<br> Is this what you had in mind? I'll say.<br> I'm shipping out tomorrow.<br> Well, then we better make this night count.<br> Wait, I forgot to turn off the cappuccino machine.<br> Anchors aweigh.<br> Oh, wait, wait! My purse, my purse! I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.<br> Why don't I just meet you upstairs? Honey!   <br>
