                    			Out of all of us, who do you think will get married next? Probably Monica and Chandler.<br> Could I have a pack of Newport Lights? We don't sell cigarettes, but they do across the street.<br> That'd be great.<br> Thanks.<br> Melissa Worbert.<br> I don't think I have the energy for this.<br> Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Greene? You've been MIA for seven sorority newsletters.<br> What's up with you? Why don't I tell you over here? So last I heard you were gonna get married.<br> Poor Ray-Ray.<br> Oh, no.<br> It's all good.<br> - I actually work at Ralph Lauren.<br> - Shut up! I will not.<br> I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear.<br> Shut up more! Are you friends with Ralph? - Oh, please.<br> - Are you? No.<br> We have to have dinner.<br> What are you doing tomorrow? - Tomorrow.<br> I don't know.<br> - You're having dinner with me.<br> Shut up.<br> I've gotta go.<br> This has been so great.<br> Oh, there you are.<br> So listen, just call me.<br> Here's my card.<br> - You're in real estate? - No, that's an old card.<br> I got out of that to do something where I could help people and make a difference.<br> What do you do now? I'm a party planner.<br> - I'll see you tomorrow.<br> - Okay.<br> Look who's back.<br> It's Ray-Ray.<br> That was my friend, Melissa, from college.<br> She seems really, really fun! She's actually sweet, and we used to be very close.<br> Wait a minute.<br> She's not the one who you? Who you what? Who you what? - Yes.<br> - Wow! Wow, what? Who you what? Oh, it's not a big deal.<br> They were lovers.<br> - What? - What? No, we weren't.<br> It was nothing.<br> It was one night, senior year, and we went to a party had a lot of sangria, and you know, ended up kissing for a bit.<br> So that's two of my wives.<br> The One With Rachel's Kisses So this is where the band is.<br> And here's the bar.<br> And all these pins have people's names on them.<br> Rach, here you are.<br> Why don't we just put me with a Manhattan in my hand talking to the cute bartender.<br> These pins aren't for playing, are they? The red are my guests, and the blue are yours.<br> This is so sad.<br> I only have like 10 pins.<br> Chandler, relax.<br> It's not a contest.<br> Certainly not a close one.<br> Hey, Rach.<br> Stop picturing it! I think that's it.<br> The seating chart is done.<br> This is our wedding.<br> They all look like they're having fun.<br> So where are my parents gonna be? Well, if this is the wedding hall your parents would be over here at home in Queens.<br> They're not invited? Oh, no, they're gonna be crushed! Why would they think they're invited? You got me.<br> I don't .<br> - Joey! - Look, I thought parents were coming.<br> Your parents are coming.<br> Chandler's are coming.<br> Ross' parents are coming.<br> Ross' parents are my parents.<br> Well, see, parents are coming.<br> - We should invite them.<br> - You just want more blue pins.<br> Well, this is just sad.<br> All right.<br> Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging.<br> Rachel may have to sit at the bar.<br> That is not a problem.<br> - Maybe you'll order a little sangria.<br> - Get out of here! These are our tuxedos.<br> If you like anything, we can make a deal.<br> Anything at all.<br> But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.<br> Thanks a lot for hooking me up.<br> And I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.<br> I'm Monica's maid of honor.<br> Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.<br> - Well, these look nice.<br> - They are nice.<br> When celebrities are done with them, they send them back.<br> - You mean like for award shows? - Some of them.<br> They've been down the red carpet with people yelling "Who are you wearing? You look fabulous! " Might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E! .<br> Okay.<br> Who wore those? - Well, this one's Tom Brokaw.<br> - Not bad.<br> This one is Paul O'Neil.<br> Who's that? He plays for the Yankees.<br> Seriously, ESPN.<br> Just once in a while.<br> Have it on in the background.<br> - This one was Pierce Brosnan.<br> - Pierce Brosnan? Are you serious? This is James Bond's tux? I have to get married in James Bond's tux.<br> It's a pretty cool tux.<br> It's not just that.<br> I would be England's most powerful weapon.<br> A jet-setting heartbreaker on Her Majesty's secret service.<br> A man who fears no one, with a license to kill.<br> Would Monica let me wear this? We should really learn how to play the real way.<br> I like our way.<br> Chess! - Nice move.<br> - Yeah.<br> I hooked Ross and Chandler up with tuxedos.<br> Do you need one? No, I'm not wearing a tux.<br> - What are you gonna wear? - Multi-colored robes.<br> And maybe a hat.<br> - Does Monica know about this? - No.<br> Can I please be there when you tell her? You want to go to a movie tonight? I'm having dinner with Melissa.<br> Can I come? I won't talk.<br> You'll just hear my video camera.<br> - What? What's going on? - Can I tell her? Do you want what happened, or Joey's lewd version? Joey's.<br> I had this college friend and I made the mistake of telling Joey that one time she and l, you know, kissed a little bit.<br> Yeah, I'm sure that happened.<br> - It did.<br> - Sure.<br> Hey.<br> It happened.<br> It was senior year.<br> It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk.<br> And we ended up kissing.<br> For several minutes.<br> Which means she had a couple spritzers and a peck on the cheek.<br> Why are you taking this away from me? Why is it so hard for you to believe? Okay.<br> I just didn't know that you were a lesbian.<br> I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian.<br> I'm just saying that this happened.<br> It just seems pretty wild.<br> And you're so vanilla.<br> Vanilla? I'm not vanilla.<br> I do lots of crazy things.<br> I mean, I got drunk and married in Vegas.<br> To Ross.<br> If you don't believe me just come with me to dinner tonight and she'll tell you.<br> Okay.<br> Because I can't picture it.<br> You should get inside my head.<br> Guess what I got for your wedding? A freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head? Rachel hooked me up with a tux.<br> But not just any tux.<br> Batman's tux! - What? - That's right.<br> Made expressly for Val Kilmer, and worn by him in the hit film that Batman film he was in.<br> You can't wear that.<br> I'm wearing the famous tux.<br> If you wear that, it'll make mine less special.<br> You need something to to make it special? You have the most special thing of all.<br> You are marrying the woman you love.<br> Don't take away my cool thing.<br> Pretty please? "Pretty please?" Not very 007.<br> If you were getting married, I'd never do anything to upset you.<br> - You slept with my sister.<br> - That was pretty 007.<br> All right, I figured it out.<br> I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8, add your parents and make them into 3 tables of 6.<br> And I called the caterer.<br> We are good to go! Yeah.<br> They're not coming.<br> What? They think that you only invited them because of me.<br> They feel unwanted.<br> That's too bad.<br> It's true.<br> But too bad.<br> If you could just call my mom.<br> Just let her know you want them there.<br> This is a woman who has sent you many lasagnas.<br> No, she hasn't.<br> Is it her fault if some didn't make it to you? What am I gonna say? Tell them you mixed up invitations.<br> No, blame it on the post office.<br> They hate the post office.<br> And the Irish.<br> But I don't think you could blame it on them.<br> Hello? Yeah, hi.<br> Mrs.<br> Tribbianni? This is Monica Geller.<br> I'm just calling to say that I really hope you can make the wedding.<br> Apparently some of our invitations weren't delivered.<br> I guess there was some screw-up at the damn post office.<br> Tell me about it! Yeah, the U.<br>S.<br> Post Office? No.<br> More like U.<br>S.<br> Lost Office.<br> What are they, Irish? Anyway, his name's Allen.<br> And we've been going out for three years.<br> He was my first client when I became a party planner.<br> He was actually planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.<br> Oh, well.<br> - He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.<br> - That's great.<br> - Were you ever in a sorority? - Of course.<br> Yes.<br> I was a Thigh Mega Tampon.<br> What one? We were huge too.<br> But they had to shut us down when Regina Phalangie died of alcohol poisoning.<br> Isn't it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? Anyway .<br> Speaking of drinking too much, I told Phoebe about that crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where we made out.<br> What? Remember we Come on, we had sarongs on and the coconut bikini tops.<br> We went back to the house and got really silly and we made out.<br> Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea what you're talking about.<br> Really? Ross is Batman.<br> Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.<br> Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.<br> Batman is so much cooler than James Bond.<br> - What? 007 has all those gadgets.<br> - Batman has a utility belt.<br> - 007 has a fancy car.<br> - Batman has the Batmobile.<br> - 007 gets all the ladies.<br> - Batman has Robin.<br> We get ESPN, right? How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo, and I'll make you a martini? I don't like martinis.<br> - A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw? - Yum.<br> I know the invitation says 6 p.<br>m.<br> But does that mean get there at 6, or the show starts at 6? The show? Right, the wedding.<br> Gotcha.<br> But weddings start a little late, right? Have you ever been to one of my weddings? Well, it's the same day as my niece's christening and I want my parents to see me.<br> My part's in the beginning.<br> I'm not in the rest of the show Wedding.<br> The wedding starts at 6.<br> Okay.<br> I totally hear you.<br> How about this? I vamp till they get there.<br> You'll "vamp"? Like warm up the crowd.<br> Ask where they're from.<br> In Joey Tribbianni, you get a minister and an entertainer.<br> I'm a "ministainer.<br>" There's no one better.<br> There's no one greater.<br> How can you not remember us kissing? I don't know.<br> I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.<br> Remember, we were on the sleeping porch? We couldn't stop giggling.<br> Our coconuts kept knocking together.<br> Somewhere Joey's head is exploding.<br> I don't want to make you uncomfortable but I told Phoebe it happened, and she doesn't believe me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I mean, if I thought it happened, I would say it.<br> Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.<br> It's okay, you don't have to do this.<br> I believe you.<br> If you say you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.<br> - Thank you, Phoebe.<br> - Okay.<br> - But she didn't.<br> - I know.<br> You carry that around? I find it to be something of a conversation piece.<br> - Between you and? - Gunther.<br> Why don't we put them on? Get a picture of Batman and James Bond, together.<br> I would, but my pants are a little tight.<br> A little tight? I could see 00 and 7 in those things.<br> I was looking forward to wearing our celebrity tuxes together.<br> - So you're not gonna be wearing yours? - Are you kidding? It's Batman's tux! Let me try it on.<br> Okay.<br> But just the jacket.<br> Holy double-vented comfort, Batman! What's this? An invitation to the At First Sight premiere? Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman.<br>  He wore it to the premiere of a fruity love story where he was a blind guy.<br> Let me see that.<br> Oh, man.<br> The only super power you have is the slightly heightened sense of smell.<br> Can I talk to you guys for a second? I give up.<br> Whatever you want, you can have it.<br> You want to sing a song or do a dance? You want your mom at the altar screaming racial slurs? I don't care.<br> I just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents.<br> They're so happy to be a part of your special day.<br> Tell them we're glad they're coming.<br> I will.<br> Oh, check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! I wear it like this when I marry you guys.<br> And then this is for party time.<br> It happened.<br> I am telling you it happened.<br> It was great meeting you.<br> And, Rachel? I don't think I'll be calling you because you know, you've gotten weird.<br> Take care, you guys.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Okay, look.<br> That night was the one wild thing I've ever done in my life.<br> I won't let you take it away.<br> So if you don't remember that, maybe you'll remember this .<br> Oh, my God.<br> You love me.<br> What? Of course I remember.<br> I think about it all the time.<br> I can still hear the coconuts knocking together .<br> I didn't want to tell you, because I didn't think you'd return my love .<br> Look who's being suddenly shy.<br> You have to feel what I feel.<br> Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.<br> I'm just a good kisser.<br> Shut up.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You don't have to be sorry.<br> I'm obviously kidding.<br> I'm not in love with you.<br> I'm not in love with her.<br> I don't hear coconuts banging together.<br> I don't picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend.<br> Anyway, I gotta go.<br> A kiss goodbye? No? Okay.<br> I mean, I had no idea that that would .<br> What the hell was that? Just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.<br> - And? - I've had better.<br> I found one that fits.<br> Well, you know what they say? Look at you, all handsome.<br> - Whose is it? - Does it matter? All that matters is that you look so handsome.<br> - Whose is it? - I don't want to say.<br> Come on, I don't care.<br> Whose is it? Diane Keaton.<br>   <br>
