                    			- Morning, roomie.<br> - Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.<br> Fifth day's a charm.<br> It's so great to be back here.<br> You're making it so easy on me and Emma.<br> It's great having you back.<br> Stay as long as you want.<br> And when does she stop crying all night? Hey! You're not naked.<br> Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight? Probably around 6.<br> But she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.<br> But she fell back to sleep, so She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.<br> - Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.<br> No, hey, it's been great.<br> I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here all my feelings from before are totally over.<br> And even if they weren't when you walk in on a woman using a breast pump - Yeah, that'll do it.<br> - Wow! So how are you? - I'm okay.<br> - Really? Sure.<br> I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course.<br> You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.<br> - Well, actually it - It's not a divorce.<br> It is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to get on with our lives.<br> Maybe start seeing other people.<br> Wow.<br> Really? Sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that'd be good for me? - Sure.<br> I know lots of girls.<br> - Any names come to mind? Names? The One With the Blind Date mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 - I was about to eat.<br> Want something? - What you got? Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots strained plums.<br> We haven't tried that yet! Goody! Thanks.<br> So how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food? I'm fine, I'm fine.<br> It's just It's just weird what's happening with her and Ross.<br> Yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.<br> Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.<br> - Why are they doing this? - I don't know.<br> They're so perfect for each other.<br> It's crazy.<br> You know what's crazy? These jars.<br> What is there, like, two bites in here? I just wish they'd realize they should be together.<br> When they moved in together, I figured that's where things were headed.<br> They should be a family.<br> They should marry and have more children.<br> Yes.<br> And they should name one of their kids Joey.<br> I may not have kids.<br> Someone's got to carry on the family name.<br> You know what? Maybe once they start dating and see what's out there they'll realize how good they are for each other.<br> Yeah, because it is slim pickings.<br> I had this date last night.<br> Yuck! But we should probably keep it down, she's still in the bedroom.<br> So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna set them up with people? I know, that just pushes them further and further apart.<br> I know what we can do.<br> We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates so they'll realize how good they are together.<br> - That's a great plan.<br> - Yeah.<br> You know what the best part of it is? I get to do my plan laugh.<br> Okay, shh! Not so loud.<br> We don't want to wake up Hi.<br> You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you? See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I mean, I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people.<br> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.<br> I was just asking because I need someone to watch Emma tonight.<br> Sure we'll do it.<br> What are you up to? - Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - Why? What's the big deal? - I figured because you and Ross are What? Slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.<br> I think it's great you're going on a date.<br> It sounds healthy.<br> I mean, you have needs.<br> Embrace your womanhood.<br> You want a job? Turn off "Oprah" and send out a resume.<br> - I'll bring her by around 7, okay? - That's perfect.<br> You guys are gonna have so much fun.<br> She's at such a cute age.<br> A couple things.<br> Now that she eats solid food, she poops around the clock.<br> And watch out for your hair because she likes to grab it.<br> She's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams, but Thanks, you guys.<br> Have fun.<br> Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.<br> Joey, hey.<br> I'm so excited.<br> - I set Rachel up with the worst guy.<br> - All right.<br> Who is he? It's a guy I used to massage.<br> By "massage" I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.<br> - Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Okay.<br> She's this really boring woman.<br> She's a teacher.<br> - A teacher? - She's into history and foreign movies.<br> And she loves puzzles.<br> Come on, who loves puzzles? Well, Ross does.<br> You're ruining the plan! Joey, you fixed him up with his perfect woman.<br> - Oh, my God, you're right! - Yeah.<br> She even reads for pleasure! - How do you know a woman like that? - I'm not allowed to know smart women? - Joey? - We met at the library.<br> I went in to pee.<br> - So now what do we do? - Well, okay.<br> I'll call her and tell her the date's canceled and find him somebody else.<br> What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off but we don't tell Ross.<br> He'll go to the restaurant and get stood up.<br> I hear that's bad.<br> So this is great.<br> Rachel's gonna have a terrible date Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realize how good they have it together.<br> Yes, the plan.<br> It's not Santa's plan.<br> No, it's - Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.<br> - No, I think we killed it.<br> Emma? Emma, look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.<br> No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay! I didn't go! Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler.<br> Funny is all I have! Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.<br> So don't touch yourself for the next 48 hours.<br> I don't do that.<br> I'll try to stop.<br> - Did you say until the 6th? - Yeah.<br> Today is the 6th.<br> No, it's not.<br> Yes, it's also 2003.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Today's the 6th? I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.<br> - Go take the test, see if we're okay.<br> - Okay.<br> Tough crib.<br> Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks? There's only one here.<br> I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.<br> I'm not working! There's not much to do around here! Excuse me.<br> Is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair? Or perhaps doing a puzzle? There's a drunk Chinese guy.<br> Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.<br> Can I get you another glass of wine? I don't know if I should.<br> I don't want to be drunk when I go home alone tonight.<br> - Got stood up, huh? - It's no big deal.<br> It's just a blind date.<br> Are you worried your date came, saw you and left? No! We're okay.<br> I'm still ovulating.<br> Oh, good, because as of 4:00 this afternoon, I am not.<br> So let's do this.<br> - I don't think I can.<br> - Oh, come on.<br> I know you're not 18 anymore, but give it a minute.<br> - Because of Emma.<br> - Oh, my God, Emma.<br> Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.<br> You're right, we can't do this.<br> We can't leave her alone.<br> Sorry.<br> Unless maybe we do it here.<br> I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age? She's aware when we leave a room.<br> She may notice if we start canoodling in it.<br> - Canoodling? - Well, I can't say hump or screw in front of the B-A-B-Y.<br> I don't know, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so - Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for? - I guess you're right.<br> - You guess? At that bed-and-breakfast, we didn't have sex because you thought a deer was staring through the window.<br> Well, what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer? Wow, everything looks so good.<br> I think I'm gonna have the chicken.<br> I just have to say this.<br> - You're really beautiful.<br> - Wow, that's very sweet.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm kind of funny-looking.<br> - What? - Look, I mean, come on you're way out of my league.<br> Everybody in here knows it.<br> I bet that guy over there is probably saying: "Why's she out with him? He must be rich.<br>" Well, I'm not.<br> What do you think you want to order? I'm real excited about that chicken.<br> I'm not funny, either.<br> So if you were thinking, "Well, he's not that good-looking but maybe we'll have some laughs," that ain't gonna happen.<br> Well, come on, Steve, let's not rule out nervous laughter.<br> Hey, now, wait a minute, Phoebe told me that you owned your own restaurant.<br> That's impressive.<br> I lost it to drugs.<br> I silk-screen T-shirts now.<br> Really? What's that like? It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money.<br> That's right.<br> I have no money, I'm not funny I live in a studio apartment with two other guys.<br> And I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.<br> Now, come on.<br> Come on, Steve.<br> There must be something that you like about yourself.<br> I do like my hair.<br> Really? - Hello? - Phoebe, it's me! I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.<br> Hey, Rach! This is the worst date ever! How could you set me up with this creep? You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.<br> I don't care.<br> This guy is a nightmare.<br> All right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.<br> - He's not stoned.<br> - Did he go out for a cigarette? - Yeah.<br> Four times.<br> - My dear, sweet Rach.<br> Well, our plan is working.<br> Rachel's having a miserable time and Ross is stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.<br> Pretty soon they'll be back together.<br> By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico.<br> Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.<br> She's asleep.<br> Chandler? - What are you doing? - Emma was doing it.<br> She's asleep.<br> - She's asleep.<br> That means we can - Yes.<br> But we have to be fast.<br> Oh, okay, I'll try.<br> - And you can't make any noise.<br> - Okay, I'll try.<br> Hello? Emma? Hey! Hi! How are you? How are you? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why is the bedroom door closed? You can't have S-E-X when you're taking care of a B-A-B-l-E.<br> I've got bad news.<br> The Chinese guy left.<br> If it was meant to be, it's meant to be.<br> Look, you got stood up.<br> Who cares? We're gonna show you a good time.<br> Sit and relax.<br> In fact, let me bring you a crab-cake appetizer on the house.<br> Wow, free crab cakes? Well, that's nice.<br> Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.<br> Just the crab cakes.<br> What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? You can't do that.<br> - Just get out of here, okay? - I'm sorry, what's going on? Okay, the waiters have a little pool going.<br> We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.<br> What?! You're making money off my misery? Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.<br> This is unbelievable.<br> I have never been so insulted in my life.<br> Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.<br> Well, that was weird.<br> You were loud and I was fast.<br> I think we may have really done it this time.<br> I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.<br> You may want to get some more of those too.<br> Where's Emma? Oh, my God, where's Emma? Where's Emma? Don't ask me.<br> I was in there canoodling you.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.<br> You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.<br> You better hope we're pregnant because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel! I can't believe I'm crying in front of you.<br> You must think I'm so pathetic.<br> No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.<br> - Really? - Don't touch my coat.<br> Sorry, that's my phone.<br> - Hello? - Hey, Rach, how's it going? Oh, my God, this is the worst date ever.<br> Oh, come on.<br> Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? - What's up? - Hey, did you stop by here? - No.<br> - Oh, my God! Then Thank God! Emma, there you are! What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she? We were playing peekaboo.<br> She loves it when I'm dramatic.<br> - Why the hell did you take her? - Because you two were having sex! - No, we weren't.<br> - Don't you lie to me.<br> I can tell by Chandler's hair.<br> You are so lazy.<br> Can't you get on top for once? All right.<br> All right, we were.<br> We're trying to make a baby.<br> Monica's ovulating.<br> It's unacceptable that you'd have sex with Emma in the next room.<br> - I'll have to tell Rachel about this.<br> - Please don't.<br> She will kill us.<br> Hey, I gotta.<br> Unless Unless what? Unless you name your first-born child Joey.<br> - What? Why? - Hey, I may never have kids and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.<br> Your family name is Tribbiani.<br> You almost had me.<br> Look I think I know the answer to this question, but would you like to make love to me? Really, really not.<br> It's just as well.<br> It doesn't work anyway.<br> All right, well, that's good to know.<br> Good night, Steve.<br> - Hey, what's wrong? - I just had a rough night.<br> Crab cake? Well, what happened? This is kind of weird to talk to you about this, but Monica told me you had a blind date.<br> - Yeah.<br> - I did too.<br> But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up? Oh, no.<br> Do you think she walked in, saw you and left? Why does everyone keep saying that? If it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.<br> - That bad? - Well, he makes T-shirts for a living and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.<br> "Female Body Inspector"? What size is that? Now wait a minute.<br> So they're gonna name their first child Joey? How do I get them to name the next one after me? It's easy.<br> You just walk in on them having sex.<br> Oh, so they owe me, like, three Phoebes.<br> Oh, my God! Look, it's Ross and Rachel! The plan is working! Don't do the plan laugh.<br> The first dates we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.<br> You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.<br> We're geniuses.<br> - Look at them! They're really bonding.<br> - They're falling in love all over again.<br> Oh, they see us.<br> Oh, they look mad.<br> They figured it out.<br> They're coming.<br> Run! - Where? - Mexico! Can you believe they're still not here? I know.<br> A double blind date and we both get stood up.<br> What are the chances? I know, I'm so bummed.<br> Could we have our free crab cakes now? - What? - We've been stood up.<br> And we want our free crab cakes.<br> Guys, give it a rest.<br> Nobody's betting on you tonight.<br> Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.<br> I have such fat hands!   <br>
