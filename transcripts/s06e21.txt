Sorry about that.<br> -So where's C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br>? -C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br> is right here.<br> Nice to meet you, Mac.<br> -This is the temporary robot, right? -No.<br> Why? Well, I just thought it was gonna be a really cool robot.<br> Like the Terminator, or when I first saw you.<br> I spent two years developing this machine.<br> It's absolutely state of the art.<br> Sorry.<br> It doesn't look like it can do anything.<br> It can do this.<br> This is my father, Paul Stevens.<br> Dad, this is Ross Geller.<br> It's great to meet you, Paul.<br> I prefer that Liz's boyfriends address me as Mr.<br> Stevens.<br> Of course.<br> Mr.<br> Stevens.<br> So, Ross what's your problem? Excuse me? Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age? It's funny.<br> It's not funny.<br> I don't like you going out with my daughter, Ross.<br> Okay, I can see that.<br> I think if you give me one chance, I can change your mind.<br> -Okay.<br> -What? Okay.<br> I'll give you one chance to change my mind.<br> You've got one minute.<br> -Daddy.<br> -Fine.<br> Two minutes.<br> Go.<br> A minute and 50 seconds.<br> I want you to know, I have never done anything like this before.<br> I mean, I've been in relationships in general.<br> But I've never done it with a student.<br> I mean, not.<br> Not "it.<br>" We haven't done "it.<br>" I mean, we've done stuff.<br> Okay.<br> A joke.<br> Lighten the mood.<br> Two guys go into a bar.<br> One of them is lrish.<br> -I'm lrish.<br> -And the lrish guy wins the joke.<br> Ross! How crazy that we would run into you.<br> Oh, my God! Thank you.<br> I 'd like you to meet my friends.<br> This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.<br> So you're Elizabeth's father? I can see now where she gets her rugged handsomeness.<br> Is there a Mrs.<br> Stevens? There's a Mr.<br> Bing! Unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born.<br> I raised her by myself.<br> I get that a lot.<br> Why don't we all take a seat? I'll get us all some coffees.<br> Yeah, why don't you.<br> And you guys can talk about whatever you want.<br> Whatever pops into your head.<br> It is so strange seeing Ross here, this time of day because usually he's at the children's hospital.<br> But not looking for dates.<br> Monica is Ross' sister.<br> He's a great brother! I had a sister.<br> She passed away.<br> You don't have to do that every time.<br> But Ross is a great guy.<br> I was roommates with him in college.<br> Funny story.<br> Your roommate in college died, didn't he? A part of him did, yes.<br> Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.<br> I hope you guys are finding something to talk about.<br> -Yes.<br> We were just-- -Sorry I'm late.<br> But I am ready to talk you up.<br> When does Liz's father get here? I'm already here.<br> Ross is so great! Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.<br> You said we would get the kind with the baby.<br> -You said the baby creeps you out.<br> -The little girl does.<br> -You said, "the baby.<br>" -Why would the baby creep me out? Why would the little girl creep you out? I'm sorry.<br> Can you please talk a little slower.<br> -This is for your book? -It's about relationships.<br> You know, the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do.<br> Keep going.<br> This stuff's great.<br> Excuse me.<br> And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.<br> And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.<br> -Oh, hi! -Hi.<br> -I left my keys here somewhere.<br> -Well, let's look for them.<br> Hey, look! Are these them? No.<br> All right.<br> -Here they are.<br> -Good.<br> -Thanks for your help.<br> -Wait! Sorry! -Mr.<br> Paul? -Just call me Paul.<br> Paul.<br> I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.<br> Maybe you could date him then.<br> It would save me the trouble of killing him.<br> Are you okay? You just don't look old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter.<br> Well, we were very young when we had her.<br> We? Yeah, it usually takes two people to.<br> Oh, no! Yes! Of course.<br> I know that! What I meant was are you still "we" or are you just you? I'm just me.<br> My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.<br> So you raised her all on your own? Yes, I did.<br> How was your first day? Pretty good.<br> Except I got a little attitude from the robot.<br> Damn those robots.<br> They're supposed to be our faithful servants! It was the guy who controls the robot.<br> He doesn't like me.<br> He had C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br> knock over the sandwich table right when I was reaching for one.<br> Why don't you get him fired? I may have to.<br> I hate to do it.<br> But I'm the star, you know? There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.<br> Excuse me.<br> Joey Tribbiani.<br> Joe! I'm glad I found you! I got an audition for you.<br> The thing is, it's kind of on the q.<br>t.<br> The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.<br> It's the lead in a series.<br> Mac and C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br> I'm the lead in Mac and C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br> Joey? Hi, Ross.<br> I was just getting him to like you.<br> Joey! Ross, Joey is not here.<br> I'll just wait for him in here! Ross, it's okay.<br> You can come out.<br> Yeah.<br> It's okay.<br> It's me Mr.<br> Stevens.<br> I didn't.<br> Oh, my gosh.<br> I didn't even see you.<br> You did.<br> You came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.<br> You were shouting, "Joey! " -Bye, Rachel.<br> -Bye.<br> I'll call you later.<br> -See ya! -Bye, Ross.<br> What? What the.<br> How did.<br> What? You know, he lost his keys.<br> So he was looking for them.<br> In your mouth? No! Downstairs.<br> And we got to talking for two hours.<br> I liked him.<br> I invited him for a cup of coffee.<br> You were at the coffee house! What's the big deal? So I kissed the guy? He's my girlfriend's father.<br> It's weird! -You dated my sister! -That was different! -What? Why? -This is weird for me! Ross, look.<br> This is good for you.<br> Let's face it.<br> So far the guy's not loving ya.<br> But I can turn that around.<br> I've got the inside track.<br> We could all go out to dinner.<br> And I could talk you up.<br> Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer! -How is that important? -It's important! There's a million guys out there who can play Mac and there's only one robot.<br> And this one guy who controls it.<br> I didn't know he could get me fired.<br> What am I gonna do? You're a pretty charming guy.<br> Thanks.<br> But I have a problem to deal with.<br> No, sweetie.<br> You've got to win over the guy who controls C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br> Go back there and kiss some serious robot ass! That's not a bad idea! If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow, I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.<br> I got some saved for you, Pheebs.<br> Do you think Joey is more charming than me? Yeah.<br> That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.<br> You wish.<br> "You wish.<br>" Stop writing about us.<br> I'm not writing about you.<br> I'm writing about other people.<br> -Who? -Marsha and Chester.<br> Fine.<br> Then you know what? I will just write about Phyllis.<br> -"Phyllis is sitting in the chair.<br>" -I see what you're doing.<br> "Phyllis sees what I'm doing.<br>" I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter! Morning! How's my favorite genius and his robot buddy? -Don't touch him! -Okay.<br> Level with me.<br> I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.<br> They even have actors coming in to read for my part.<br> Come on, man.<br> You gotta give me a second chance.<br> I love this little guy.<br> That's why you didn't want me to touch him, right? I can't believe this! God! Hey, how are you doing? So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.<br> So Ross selflessly offered to take me.<br> What a nice story.<br> So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom.<br> I definitely did not see that one backfiring.<br> -I'm going to the bathroom.<br> -Take your time.<br> I was a freshman and she was a senior.<br> So it wasn't as bad as-- Look.<br> I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs.<br> It's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie and partly because they just keep coming to me.<br> I have to admit that after all the wonderful things Lizzie has told me and the many stories that Rachel has told me well you're not all bad.<br> "Not all bad.<br>" I'm sorry I was so harsh.<br> But you have to understand.<br> I still look at Lizzie like she's a 12-year-old girl.<br> I know what you mean.<br> I do that, too.<br> -I beg your pardon? -I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.<br> I mean, I have a son who is six and I still think of him as a baby.<br> You have a son? My ex-wife and I share custody of Ben.<br> Just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I'm sure you are with your wife.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's unbelievable! Don't worry.<br> I just didn't realize you were married.<br> We were.<br> But that was just a.<br> That was just a big drunken mistake.<br> You're back.<br> You two were married? I'm sorry.<br> You were talking about Emily.<br> We said we would meet at the coffee house at 6:00.<br> We said 7:00.<br> We said 6:00! The only way that I said 6:00 would be if I said the sentence, "Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00.<br>" If I had said 7:00, I would have said: "My boyfriend is such a wiseass.<br> 7:00! " -Hi! -Oh, my good God! -I know what time you said.<br> -What? Well, actually I know what time Chester and Marsha said.<br> What time? What an interesting turn of events.<br> Suddenly it's my book to the rescue.<br> Let's see.<br> Very interesting.<br> Well this certainly clears things up.<br> What does it say? I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.<br> Thank you for writing your book.<br> It's a great book and you are the queen of everything.<br> Thanks.<br> So are you.<br> I told you I should not wear this color.<br> "Monica, Marsha and Chester are planning on seeing a movie Sunday night.<br> "Marsha thinks they're meeting at 6:00.<br> Chester thinks it's 7:00.<br>" -You knew we were gonna miss the movie? -That's right.<br> Instead of telling us, you decided to write it in your stupid book? "Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis.<br>" I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.<br> I'm so sorry, man.<br> Is there anything I can do? Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.<br> Joey, I want to talk to you.<br> Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne.<br> I hate you.<br> You ruined my life.<br> -Chandler, Wayne.<br> Wayne, Chandler.<br> -Hi.<br> How are you? Joey, I'll get you your job back if you help me out.<br> Why should I help you out? -The reason he just said.<br> -What do you need? I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman.<br> You know, Sarah.<br> I wish I could talk to her.<br> -Are you in love with her? -Yeah.<br> Her.<br> All of them.<br> Anyone.<br> Yeah.<br> I've been there, my friend.<br> Listen, I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.<br> It's not something you can teach.<br> It's something you're born with.<br> You can teach it.<br> I can show you right now.<br> Well, if you think about it Ross did learn something from each marriage.<br> How to make the next one even shorter? Wait a minute.<br> That's not fair.<br> He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to Emily.<br> He just didn't tell me.<br> Maybe I have to pee again.<br> Well, this is fun.<br> So Ross, did you kill any of these wives? I have had enough of this! I care a great deal about your daughter.<br> And I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if you've got a problem with me-- Are you yelling at me? God, no.<br> You know what, Daddy? lf you don't like Ross, that's fine.<br> It doesn't matter to me.<br> I'm going to go out with him anyway.<br> Really? Well, if it doesn't matter to her it doesn't matter to me.<br> Still not yelling.<br> What can I say? This doesn't make me like you more.<br> That's okay.<br> I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.<br> -Then we agree? -I guess so.<br> -Neither of us like Ross.<br> -I like Ross.<br> Kids! Wait.<br> I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is.<br> That's okay, Rach.<br> We're not liking Ross right now.<br> Well, I got a lot of those, too.<br> It turns out you were right, C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br> -That shipment never made it to Omaha? -You got it.<br> And the rabbi's beard? Nice catch, C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br> It's your line, C.<br>H.<br>E.<br>E.<br>S.<br>E.<br> Wayne! Wayne!   <br>
