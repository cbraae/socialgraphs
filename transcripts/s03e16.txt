                    			-Previously on Friends.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.<br> You want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? -Is this about Mark? -Oh, my God.<br> -Okay, it's not.<br> -Oh, my God.<br> I cannot keep having this fight with you! Maybe we should just take a break.<br> Fine.<br> You're right.<br> Let's take a break.<br> Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.<br> A break from us.<br> Then we had this big fight, and I said I wanted to take a break.<br> I don't want to take a break.<br> This is crazy.<br> Can 't we work on this? What do you want to drink? Who's that? Nobody.<br> Is that Mark? Honey, look, he just-- Yeah.<br> Got it! Hey, come dance.<br> What, are you married? Because that's okay.<br> THE NEXT MORNING How was the big anniversary dinner? Well, we never actually got to dinner.<br> Nice.<br> We kind of broke up instead.<br> What? My God! It's on the ceiling! That's okay.<br> This is more important than fruit.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>on my ceiling.<br> You broke up? Yeah, but it's okay because when Ross left, Mark came over.<br> -Oh, no! You and Mark? -It's okay.<br> Calm down.<br> Mark and I talked.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I realized how much I love your stupid brother.<br> We got our problems, but I really wanna make it work.<br> Morning! The One the Morning After .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) It's me.<br> I've been trying to reach you all night.<br> I feel awful.<br> There's nothing between me and Mark.<br> This whole breakup thing is just stupid.<br> I'm sorry I put you through it.<br> And I don 't want to get back together over a machine.<br> So I love you.<br> I love you.<br> And you know what? I'm gonna go to bed now but on my way to work tomorrow, I'll stop by around 8:30.<br> Bye.<br> Chloe, how's it coming? What kind of puppy do you think I should get? Well, how about a big one? -But my apartment's so-- -Then a small one.<br> -We have to go.<br> -Wait! Where's my shoes? You need shoes? -Do I know why we're rushing? -You know my girlfriend? It turns out that she wants to get back together.<br> I found it! That's so great for you guys! You must be so happy! Yes, I am.<br> One of the many things I'm feeling.<br> -Good luck with your girlfriend.<br> -Thank you.<br> -You got my message? -You are right on time! So can I be your girlfriend again? Yes, you can.<br> very much.<br> -Why are you mopping your ceiling? -There's banana on it.<br> I have the spirit of an old lndian woman living in mine.<br> So, then, you know.<br> The mailman was here, so I brought your mail.<br> -Oh, good.<br> Thanks.<br> -Now, what is Fabutech? Don't judge me too much, okay? I saw this infomercial, and I swear I have never.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>bought anything on Tv before.<br> Except for this mop.<br> But there was this amazing stuff on leg-waxing-- Waxine! Yes! Have you seen it? It's incredible! I want to be a Waxine Girl! I know! Do you think it really doesn't hurt? How can they do that? Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the rain forest? They have the best stuff in there.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone to make up with Rachel.<br> Which is probably what you should have done.<br> You think? God, I'm in hell.<br> I mean, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all "I love you," and all I can think about.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is what is she gonna do when I tell her what I did? First, we should address the more important question.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>how dumb are you? Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right? How can I do that without being honest? I'm onboard about the total-honesty thing.<br> I am.<br> Just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.<br> He's right.<br> Nobody benefits, and you'll just hurt her.<br> And there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.<br> Don't you think-- If you have to tell her, at least wait till the timing's right.<br> And that's what deathbeds are for.<br> -Yeah, okay.<br> -All right.<br> Okay.<br> Now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way.<br> Did you think about the trail? What trail? From the woman you did it with.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to the woman you hope never finds out you did it! Always think about the trail! I don't think there's any trail.<br> Chloe works with that guy, lsaac.<br> Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works at the massage place with Phoebe.<br> Phoebe is Rachel's friend, and that's the trail! I did it! "After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg--" Did that! "Grasp the linen strip by its tab.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and pull it off in one quick, pain-free motion.<br> " Was it not "pain-free"? No, it was pain-ful! My God, they should call it "Pain-zine, now with a little wax.<br> " The girls on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.<br> Because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid.<br> But you know, if you don't believe me, please, be my guest.<br> Now are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips? Chloe, hi.<br> Is this about me taking your watch? -You took my watch? -I'm sorry.<br> I do that.<br> You keep it.<br> Listen, did you tell anyone about us? I feel like it really isn't anybody's business.<br> Exactly.<br> So you didn't mention anything to lsaac? -I tell lsaac everything.<br> -You do? Of course you do.<br> Hi, lsaac.<br> You know, we haven't actually met.<br> You dog! Yes, I suppose I am a dog.<br> But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.<br> Right.<br> Rachel from the coffee place.<br> That's the one.<br> Listen, I don't want to hurt her.<br> I know.<br> It doesn't matter how much we love them.<br> Monogamy is too cruel a rule.<br> Listen, can you keep this information to yourself? No problem.<br> We gotta look out for each other.<br> We're the same, you and me.<br> Actually, no, we're not.<br> Yeah, we are.<br> No, we're not.<br> Yeah, we are.<br> No, we're not.<br> -Okay, we're not.<br> -Right.<br> But we are.<br> Fine.<br> I just need to know that you won't tell your sister.<br> I can promise not to tell her again.<br> Jasmine? We met at Phoebe's birthday party.<br> I'm Ross Geller.<br> You did a bad thing! -Yes, I did.<br> -very bad! -very bad.<br> -very, very bad! I'm agreeing with you.<br> Listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet? Please.<br> Please don't.<br> I love my girlfriend very much and I want to work it out with her.<br> All right.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> But you should talk to my roommate.<br> I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.<br> Who's your roommate? Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Was I not supposed to? -We're all right.<br> -It's okay.<br> It's okay.<br> -We were just waxing our legs.<br> -Off? For your information, this is a pain like no man will ever experience.<br> Unless you've been kicked in an area.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that God only meant to be treated nicely.<br> Women just have a lower threshold for pain than men, that's all.<br> I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.<br> Oh, yeah? Come here.<br> Oh, that's mature.<br> So now I just pull it off? That's right.<br> Just talk to me.<br> Please! Talk to you? I can't even look at you right now.<br> Nothing.<br> Nothing.<br> -She said it was okay.<br> -What are they talking about? -Just get away from me! -I made a mistake, okay? A mistake? What were you trying to put it in? Her purse? Where did he put it? You had sex with another woman! Oh, my God! I knew something was wrong because my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.<br> I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk-- You guys knew about this and didn't tell us? He has sex and we get hit in our heads! I want you to leave! Just get out! Now! I want to stay and talk about this.<br> All right.<br> How was she? -What? -Was she good? Don't answer that.<br> You said you wanted to talk about it.<br> Let's talk.<br> How was she? -She was.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -Awful.<br> -She was not good.<br> -Horrible.<br> Nothing compared to you.<br> She was different.<br> Good different? Nobody likes change.<br> -Just stop! -What? Okay! Okay! Okay! Should we do something? Yeah.<br> Never cheat on Rachel.<br> I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry.<br> I was disgusted with myself.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and this morning I was upset.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then I got your message and I was so happy.<br> And all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment-- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute.<br> What time did your little friend leave? Oh, my God.<br> She was there? She was still there? She was in there when I was in there? Listen, the important thing is she meant nothing to me.<br> And yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship! I didn't think there was a relationship.<br> -We'd broken up.<br> -We were on a break.<br> That, for all I knew, could last forever.<br> That is a breakup.<br> You gonna get out of this on a technicality? I'm not trying to "get out" of anything.<br> I thought our relationship was dead.<br> Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.<br> I don't think we should listen to this anymore.<br> What are you doing? We can't go out.<br> Why not? I'm hungry.<br> Because they'll know we've been listening.<br> God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther! I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen! Oh, that is so sweet.<br> I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.<br> We can go out.<br> They have other things to worry about.<br> We'll be fine.<br> Rachel, I wanted to tell you.<br> I thought I should.<br> And then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to! Wax the door shut.<br> We're never leaving.<br> It's Phoebe.<br> Someone has to take my 9:00 with Mr.<br> Rehak.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because it's 9: 1 5 now, and I'm not there.<br> None of this would've happened if I didn't think.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you were having sex with Mark? All right.<br> Let's say I had slept with Mark.<br> Would you have been able to forgive me? Yes, I would.<br> You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and made love to me? If you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were-- I would have been devastated.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I would still want to be with you.<br> Because, I mean, it's you.<br> Come on, tell me what you're thinking.<br> I'm thinking.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm gonna order a pizza.<br> Order a pizza, like.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> "I forgive you"? Oh, man! Pizza? I like pizza.<br> Put olives on the pizza.<br> We could eat the wax! It's organic! Oh, great.<br> Food with hair on it.<br> No, not the used wax.<br> Because that would be crazy? Could I get in on that? Because I'm kind of hungry myself.<br> Fine.<br> Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.<br> -No anchovies.<br> -With extra anchovies.<br> That's okay.<br> I'll pick them off.<br> And could you chop some up and put it right in the sauce? You can have the last piece if you want.<br> Well, I should think so.<br> You slept with someone.<br> They're gonna get through this, aren't they? Yeah.<br> Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.<br> They've got to.<br> What if they don't? You think I need a new walk? What? Well, I've been walking the same way since high school.<br> You know how some guys walk into a room and everybody takes notice? I think I need a take-notice walk.<br> Are you actually saying these words? What, now you're not even talking to me? Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I was out of my mind.<br> I thought I'd lost you.<br> How insane must I have been to do something like this? I don't cheat, right? That's not me.<br> I'm not Joey! It's 3 a.<br>m.<br> They don't know that I've come home yet.<br> You notice how they aren't wondering where I am? You know, people can be so self-involved.<br> You know what? I'm not the one that wanted that break.<br> You're the one that bailed.<br> You're the one.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that ran the moment things got rough.<br> -That's-- -That's what? -That is neither here nor there.<br> -Here we are.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in a spot again.<br> What do you want? How do you want to handle it? You want to fight for us or bail? Look, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing, okay? I'm sorry.<br> I wish I could take it back, but I can't.<br> I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.<br> I love you so much.<br> No, Ross! Don't! You can't just kiss me and make it all go away.<br> It doesn't work that way.<br> It doesn't just make it better.<br> I think you should go.<br> What? I really think you need to go now.<br> This morning you said there was nothing we couldn't work out.<br> What the hell did I know? There's got to be a way we can work past this.<br> I can't imagine my life without you.<br> Without these arms.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and your face and heart.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>your good heart, Rach, and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I can't.<br> You're a totally different person to me now.<br> I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me.<br> Ever.<br> Now I can't stop picturing you with her.<br> I can't.<br> It doesn't matter what you say or what you do.<br> It's just changed everything.<br> Forever.<br> This can't be it.<br> Then how come it is? They've been quiet for a long time.<br> Maybe she killed him.<br> Let's go.<br> Is that your new walk? I really have to pee.<br>   <br>
