I was kind of using that machine.<br> Yeah, well, now you' re kind of not.<br> But I saved it.<br> I put my basket on top.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Is that your basket? It's pretty.<br> Unfortunately, I don't see suds! What? No suds, no save, okay? What's going on? Nothing.<br> This horrible woman just took my machine.<br> Was your basket on top? -Yeah, but there were no suds.<br> -So? -You know, no suds, no save.<br> -No suds, no Excuse me.<br> Hold on a second! This is my friend's machine.<br> Hey, hey, hey! Her stuff wasn't in it! Hey, hey, hey! That's not the rule, and you know it! All right.<br> Show's over.<br> Nothing to see here.<br> Okay.<br> Let's do laundry.<br> That was amazing! I can't even send back soup.<br> Well, that's because you' re such a sweet, gentle.<br> Do you? Do you? Oh, hey.<br> You must need detergent.<br> -What's that? -Uberweiss.<br> It's new.<br> It's German.<br> It's extra tough! Rach, are you gonna separate those? Oh, God.<br> Am I being a total laundry spaz? Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants? Have you never done this before? Well, not myself.<br> But I know other people that have.<br> Okay.<br> You caught me.<br> I'm a laundry virgin.<br> Don't worry.<br> I'll use the gentle cycle.<br> Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.<br> A whole other machine for your colors.<br> And a third for your delicates.<br> That would be your bras and your underpanty things.<br> These are white cotton panties.<br> Would they go with whites or with delicates? That would be a judgment call.<br> He's so cute! Where did you grow up? -Brooklyn Heights.<br> -Cleveland.<br> -How'd that happen? -My God! What? I suddenly had the feeling I was falling.<br> But I'm not.<br> So, you and Angela, huh? -Yep.<br> Pretty much.<br> -You' re a lucky man.<br> Know what I miss most about her? That cute nibbly noise she makes when she eats.<br> Like a happy little squirrel or a weasel.<br> -I never really noticed.<br> -Oh, yeah, yeah.<br> Listen for it.<br> Monica.<br> Monica is great.<br> Yeah, she is.<br> But it's not gonna last.<br> She's too much for me in bed.<br> Sexually.<br> I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.<br> Yeah, isn't he? It's great to meet a smart, funny guy who's emotionally older than 8.<br> You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed! My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.<br> That's nice.<br> You can.<br> It's like pulling off a Band-Aid.<br> Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.<br> Go! Go! Hi, Janice.<br> Here we go.<br> I don't think we should go out anymore.<br> All right.<br> Well, there you go.<br> Stop it, stop it, stop it.<br> This isn't about you.<br> I know! It's about your fear of commitment.<br> I' m not afraid.<br> -Please.<br> -I don't! -I don't! I' m ready to commit anytime.<br> -Really? I know this is gonna sound stupid  but I feel that if I can do this if I can actually do my own laundry there isn't anything I can't do.<br> That does not sound stupid to me.<br> The first time I had to cook for myself after Carol left me I'm sorry, that's all the time we have.<br> Next on Ross.<br> -Uh-oh.<br> -What? Uh-oh.<br> Uh-oh, the laundry's done.<br> It's a song.<br> The laundry song we sing.<br> Uh-oh! The laundry's done -What's the matter? -Nothing.<br> The laundry's done Come on, show me.<br> It's just that you left a red sock with your whites, and now everything's kind of pink.<br> Everything's pink? Except for the red sock, which is still red.<br> Don't be upset.<br> It can happen to anyone.<br> But it happened to me.<br> God, I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep! What am I doing? My father's right! I can't live on my own.<br> I can't even do laundry! Something went wrong with Underdog and they couldn't inflate his head.<br> So anyway his head is flopping down Broadway, right? And I'm thinking how inappropriate this is.<br> Something's in my eye.<br> Could we check it in the light, please? -Oh, my God! -What? Were we at the same table? It's like cocktails in Appalachia.<br> -They' re close.<br> -Close? Her tongue's in his ear.<br> Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross.<br> Joey, this is sick.<br> It's disgusting.<br> It's  not really true' is it? Who's to say what's true? -What were you thinking? -l' m not proud of this, okay? Well, maybe I am a little.<br> -l' m out of here! -Wait! You like him.<br> I want her.<br> He likes you.<br> -Really? -Yeah.<br> If we put our heads together, between the two of us we can break them up.<br> I' m sorry.<br> I can't believe I did this.<br> I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.<br> Waiter? One more plate of chicken wings over here.<br> Here's the thing.<br> We're different.<br> I'm bing, bing, bing.<br> You' re boom, boom, boom.<br> Oh, my God! I' m so sorry! Are you okay? It's just my lens.<br> It's my lens.<br> I'll be right back.<br> I hit her in the eye! In the eye! This is the worst breakup in the history of the world!

Chandler, easy, easy.<br> Go to your happy place.<br> -l' m fine, l' m fine.<br> -All right.<br> -l' m not fine.<br> Here she is.<br> -Wait here, okay? Breathe.<br> -How do you do that? -It's like a gift.<br> We should always break up together.<br> I'd like that! The clothes are clean.<br> That's the important part.<br> I guess.<br> Except everything looks like jammies now.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Excuse me.<br> We had this cart.<br> I had a 24-inch waist.<br> You lose things.<br> Now, come on.<br> Get out of my way.<br> I' m sorry.<br> Maybe I wasn't being clear.<br> This was our cart.<br> There weren't clothes in it! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Quit making up rules! Let go! Come on, it's my cart.<br> Listen, Mitzi, if you want it you' re gonna have to take me with it! -Yes! Did you see that? -You were incredible.<br> A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Thank you.<br> I could not have done this without you.<br> More clothes in the dryer? -I'm fine.<br> I'm fine.<br> -Are you sure? -Are you sure you' re okay? -Yeah.<br> -Does it still hurt? -Yeah.<br> What a neat idea! All your clothes match.<br> I' m gonna do this.<br> -How'd it go? -Excellent! We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.<br> What a beautiful story.<br> -I'm fine, by the way.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> -Where's Chandler? -He needed time to grieve.<br> I' m free! I' m free! That ought to do it.<br>   <br>
