                    			Good morning, tiger.<br> I'm making you a big breakfast, so you can keep up your strength for tonight.<br> You're gonna get me good and pregnant.<br> I've got nowhere to go this morning.<br> I'm unemployed.<br> I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.<br> Well, I just lost my erection.<br> No, I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself? You're supposed to find your passion in life.<br> You can be whatever you want to be now.<br> It's exciting.<br> Yeah, but it's all so overwhelming.<br> I don't know where to start.<br> Wait a second.<br> I can help you with this.<br> You just need to be organized.<br> We can make a list of your qualifications and categorize jobs by industry.<br> There could be folders and files Hey, this is where your hyper-organized pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.<br> I know! My erection is back! The One Where Rachel Goes Back to Work mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Thank you.<br> Joey, could I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin? - Okay.<br> - Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian? I'm sorry.<br> It's just, I'm a little short on cash.<br> If you want, I could loan you some money.<br> Oh, no.<br> I learned never to borrow money from friends.<br> That's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.<br> Hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show? You could do that? The pay's pretty good, and you could do it for as long as you need.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> I'm gonna be on TV! - Okay, now I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.<br> - Really? - No, it is awesome.<br> Hey, guys.<br> Why are you all dressed up? We're bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone.<br> - Doesn't she look cute? - She sure does.<br> Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head? Because if one more person says, "What a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna.<br> I think she's gonna be the hit of the office.<br> Yeah, she's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts.<br> Can I get a blue bow? Okay.<br> I have looked through a bunch of career guides photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders, so you can make an informed decision.<br> How long was I in there? Okay, let's start with the A's.<br> Advertising.<br> Wait.<br> Advertising, that's a great idea.<br> Don't you wanna look through the rest? I don't think I have to hear the rest.<br> Advertising makes perfect sense.<br> Sorry you had to waste all this time.<br> You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Now I'll get to use my shredder! I mean, I could write slogans.<br> How hard could it be, right? "Cheese.<br> It's milk that you chew.<br>" "Crackers.<br> Because your cheese needs a buddy.<br>" "A grape.<br> Because who can get a watermelon in your mouth?" I got one.<br> "Socks.<br> Because your family's feet deserve the best.<br>" Honey, leave it to the pros.<br> I actually know someone in advertising.<br> I grew up with a guy who is a vice president at a big agency.<br> Maybe I can get him to meet you.<br> Give me the phone.<br> "The phone.<br> Bringing you closer to people who have phones.<br>" "Marriage.<br> It's not for everybody.<br>" That went well.<br> Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.<br> Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.<br> I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff.<br> - Who the hell are you? - Who the hell are you? I'm the hell person whose office this is.<br> Good one, Rach.<br> I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taking over your job.<br> Excuse me? Your baby's so cute.<br> But why would you put a pink bow on a boy? Hey, Joey.<br> Look at me.<br> I'm a nurse.<br> Yes, you are.<br> I think it might be time for my sponge bath.<br> Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras.<br> - So are you excited about your scene? - Yeah, but I'm a little nervous.<br> Relax.<br> Don't be.<br> They'll probably just make you stand in the background.<br> - Good.<br> - You.<br> Here, come here.<br> Here.<br> Take this tray, stand on this yellow mark.<br> You're gonna move on "action.<br>" Walk over to the operating table, stop on the blue mark and put the tray down.<br> Don't walk too fast.<br> But don't dawdle.<br> Okay.<br> Now, what? And, action! Cut! Cut.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I'm just a little nervous.<br> - Well, don't be.<br> Okay, that helps.<br> And, action! Cut! Don't worry about it, Pheebs.<br> It usually takes me three takes too.<br> All right, eight.<br> And, action! So do you have any other questions about advertising? No.<br> But let me show you what I can do.<br> "Bagels and doughnuts.<br> Round food for every mood.<br>" Monica warned me you might do that.<br> I think we might have something for you at the agency.<br> - Really? That's great.<br> - It's an unpaid internship.<br> That's funny.<br> When you said "unpaid," it sounded like you said "unpaid.<br>" Come on, now.<br> Monica has a good job.<br> It's not like you have a family to support.<br> Actually, we're trying.<br> I don't think Monica is gonna want to postpone it.<br> We're supposed to have sex tonight.<br> Actually, she's probably at home, naked right now.<br> I tend to keep talking till somebody stops me.<br> - I can just picture her on the bed.<br> - Stop! Wait.<br> What do you mean you're taking over my job? While you were on your baby vacation, I was doing your job.<br> A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.<br> Clearly, you've never been to Sandals Paradise Island.<br> All right.<br> Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks.<br> I want everything back the way it was.<br> I can't say I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.<br> I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in.<br> - Excuse me? - Rach, we have a code brown situation.<br> Honey, could you please take care of it for me? All right, but you're gonna have to do one sometime.<br> Let me just get this straight.<br> So I go have a baby, and they send some guy in to do my job? Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren altogether.<br> Okay.<br> Right.<br> You're very cheeky for a temp.<br> I'm not a temp.<br> I was transferred here from another department.<br> And what department was that? The jerk department? They didn't tell me about your quick wit.<br> Well, did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue? - Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.<br> - Hi, Mr.<br> Zelner.<br> Rachel.<br> I see you've met Gavin.<br> When you left us, we weren't sure what we were gonna do.<br> But then, Gavin to the rescue.<br> Super Gavin.<br> Well, that's great.<br> So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where do you plan on flying off to? That's up to Mr.<br> Zelner.<br> I'm sure he'll make the right decision.<br> Super ass-kissing power.<br> Incidentally, when are you coming back? Today.<br> - You said two weeks.<br> - No, I said today.<br> See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.<br> So, what'd he say? He can be a little rough around the edges so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot with the word "puppy.<br>" So he said, "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together I am gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.<br>" I'm sorry.<br> I can't do this.<br> I'm just not an actor.<br> That's right.<br> You're not.<br> You're a nurse.<br> - You're Nurse With Tray.<br> - No, Joey Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.<br> She has no time for friends.<br> She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor because if she doesn't, people die.<br> Who dies? Man With Eye Patch! Now, you get in there, and you do your job.<br> Yes, doctor.<br> Okay, let's try this one more time.<br> Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch.<br> Your tray is coming.<br> And, action.<br> Yes, I did it! I nailed it! What's next? The rest of the scene.<br> Okay, from the top, people.<br> Listen, sudden change of plans.<br> My maternity leave just ended.<br> They said if I didn't come back today, they'd fire me.<br> What? No, that's illegal.<br> I'll have the Labor Department here so fast, they won't All right, calm down, Norma Rae.<br> They didn't actually say that.<br> I'm just afraid if I don't come back now, this guy will try and squeeze me out.<br> But what about Emma? I mean, we don't have a nanny.<br> I know.<br> We're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight.<br> Can you please just take care of her for today? Absolutely.<br> Just give me your breasts, and we'll be on our way.<br> Come on.<br> I don't know what else to do.<br> Fine.<br> Fine.<br> We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will.<br> Yes, we Ross.<br> You're pretty.<br> Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a new career from scratch.<br> It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it.<br> Maybe now's not the right time to be starting a family.<br> So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now? Yeah.<br> Goodbye.<br> Okay, it's baby time.<br> Pants off, Bing.<br> Didn't see you there, Geller.<br> Ross is here, so And I was really hoping that maybe I could hang out.<br> You know, what do you feel like doing? Well, we're gonna have sex.<br> I don't feel like having sex.<br> Maybe I don't know.<br> Maybe we can watch a movie or something.<br> Let me put it this way: We're having sex whether you're here or not.<br> Pants off, Bing.<br> Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to.<br> Well, I've changed your screen saver from that picture of *NS YNC.<br> Hey, they were popular when I left.<br> I'm working on this big presentation for tomorrow.<br> I should be involved in that, so get me up to speed.<br> That'll take weeks.<br> Let me take care of the presentation.<br> No.<br> I see what you're doing here, all right? This is my job, buddy.<br> I've had it for five years, and I know how it works.<br> - So why don't you just catch me up.<br> - Fine.<br> Oh, God.<br> You've totally messed with the back support on my chair.<br> - How do you fix this? - You've been here five years.<br> - You figure it out.<br> - Fine, I will.<br> All right, fill me in.<br> Do you have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.<br> Yeah, but you have to give it back if I get a job.<br> Of course, by that time, ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jumpsuits.<br> Hey, good morning, lover.<br> I gotta say, after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.<br> Here's an idea.<br> You walk into a room, take a quick scan.<br> Sorry.<br> But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.<br> Oh, God, I have to tell you something.<br> You're not pregnant.<br> What are you talking about? Well, that thing that I have to do to make a baby? I faked it.<br> What? You faked it? You know what? I don't need a tie.<br> I mean, it's better open collar, you know? It's more casual.<br> Joey.<br> Listen, I can't do this.<br> It doesn't make any sense.<br> Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe? Sometimes we use the same extras for different parts.<br> It's okay.<br> Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse.<br> And now, suddenly, I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.<br> Well, maybe you are a nurse but you moonlight as a waitress.<br> Because I'm a single mother supporting my two children.<br> Nice.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Dr.<br> Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital.<br> Wouldn't I come say hi? No.<br> No, see, you and Drake are having a fight.<br> About what? He slept with you and then never called you.<br> And I just wanted a new daddy for Davey and Becky.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, from the top.<br> And, action.<br> So I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.<br> I'm surprised too.<br> But yet, here I am.<br> Cut! Cut! What are you doing? I'm very angry at him because he slept with me and never called me back.<br> - Me too.<br> - Me too! Calm down.<br> She means on the show.<br> We need some new extras around here.<br> Wow.<br> You're here already.<br> Yes.<br> Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation.<br> Actually, I made a few changes.<br> I think I'm caught up on everything.<br> So ask me anything.<br> - How do you fix the chair? - Except that! Hello, Mr.<br> Zelner.<br> We are all ready for our presentation this afternoon.<br> - Good, because it's in 10 minutes.<br> - What? I can't do that.<br> I have the baby.<br> Ross is not gonna pick her up for an hour.<br> Then Gavin can give the presentation.<br> We have to do it now.<br> Ralph needs to leave early today.<br> He's going helicopter shopping.<br> Well, there you go, you win.<br> You win.<br> You get to do the presentation.<br> You'll knock them dead.<br> No one will remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter and Super Gavin will just fly right alongside of him.<br> - You can do the presentation.<br> - No, I can't.<br> I have a baby.<br> I'll watch her.<br> Why would you do that? Because you worked really hard, and it's your job.<br> And you're a little crazy.<br> That's really nice.<br> I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.<br> Well, you're not gonna like what's coming.<br> I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> God.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm really fine.<br> Don't worry.<br> I'm great with children.<br> Gavin Mitchell.<br> Pleased to meet you.<br> Please don't fire my friend.<br> Just let me talk to her.<br> - Okay, but this is her last chance.<br> - Thank you.<br> How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald.<br> Listen, Pheebs.<br> I was just talking to the director and he was thinking maybe this time you don't hit Drake.<br> You just wait on the tables.<br> I can't do that.<br> I'm an actor.<br> I have a process.<br> You're a masseuse.<br> You have a table with a hole in it.<br> Wait, I see what's happening here.<br> You're threatened.<br> What? I'm so good in the scene that I'm stealing focus from you.<br> Rise to the challenge, Tribbiani, because I just raised the bar.<br> Come join me up here.<br> Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security.<br> She won't go easy.<br> You faked it? You couldn't have faked it.<br> Yes, you can.<br> You just make the faces and the noises.<br> Guys can fake it? Unbelievable.<br> The one thing that's ours.<br> Why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby? Well, that's actually why.<br> Look, I'm starting a whole new career now.<br> I'm not saying I don't want a baby.<br> I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.<br> Like a month? - Or a year? - Really? You wanna wait a year? It could be less than a year.<br> I mean, you've heard my stuff.<br> "Pants.<br> Like shorts but longer.<br>" Lt'll probably be more than a year.<br> - I really wanna have a baby.<br> - Well, yeah, me too.<br> Look, I'll just get my old job back.<br> No, I want you to have a job that you love not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.<br> I quit, and you learn what I do? I think there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby.<br> Now you're unemployed, and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy.<br> There's always gonna be a reason not to do this but I think once the baby comes, we'll forget about all those reasons.<br> I guess.<br> I mean, it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.<br> It's gonna be really scary.<br> I mean, God, when we have a baby there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control.<br> I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess.<br> I won't have time to clean it.<br> What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer and messes up all the ribbons? What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer because the baby's stuff takes up all the space? Where will all the ribbons go? Should we go make a baby before you change your mind? - Yes, please! - Okay.<br> And I promise I will not fake it this time.<br> Well, I wish I could say the same.<br> I'm a little shook up.<br> I know you botched that operation on purpose.<br> I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder.<br> I don't care if you are my brother.<br> I'm not your brother.<br> What about my children, Drake? No! No! No!   <br>
