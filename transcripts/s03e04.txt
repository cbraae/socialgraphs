Boy, you said it, Mike.<br> -There's gotta be a better way.<br> -There is, Kevin! -Can we please turn this off? -No way, Kevin! What if I told you there's a new product that guarantees  you'll never have to open up milk cartons again? Meet the Milkmaster 2000! -Intrigued? -You' re flinging, flanging right I am! This is the first time he's used this.<br> You'll see how easy this is to do.<br> -This works in any milk carton.<br> -Wow, it is easy! Now I can have milk every day.<br> The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) It's official.<br> There are no good movies.<br> So let's go to a bad one, and make out.<br> Perhaps you'd like me to turn so you can bunny-bump against my back? -Hey, man.<br> What's up? -Maybe you can tell me.<br> My agent wants to know why I didn't show up at my audition today.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>my first good one in weeks.<br> How could you not give me the message? I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but it wasn't me.<br> Yes, it was.<br> It was him! Okay, it was me! -How was it you? -Well, it was all so crazy, you know? Chandler was in the closet, counting to 1 0.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.<br> I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand.<br> See? All of it.<br> Yep, that's my audition.<br> See? Now, this is why I keep notepads everywhere.<br> Yep.<br> And that's why we don't invite you to play.<br> What is the great tragedy here? Get yourself another appointment.<br> Estelle tried.<br> The casting director told her I missed my chance.<br> Well, that is unfair! I'll call her.<br> I'll tell her it was my fault.<br> You can't.<br> The casting director doesn't talk to friends.<br> -She only talks to agents.<br> -What a sad little life she must lead.<br> -What are you doing? -No, I know, I know.<br> Hi, this is Caitlin from Phoebe Buffay's office.<br> Is Anne there for Phoebe? She'll know what it's about.<br> Hang up.<br> Hang up right-- Annie? Hi.<br> Listen, we've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani.<br> Apparently, he missed his audition.<br> Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle? I don't know what to do with her.<br> So your husband leaves and burns down the apartment.<br> The world doesn't stop.<br> Is anybody else scared? If Joey loses this audition, then that is it for Estelle.<br> I don't care! Annie, you are a doll.<br> What time can you see him? I need a pen.<br> Pen! Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad! Oh, now you want a pad.<br> Where's my boy? Here's my boy! And here's his Barbie! What's my boy doing with a Barbie? He picked it out at the store.<br> He loves it.<br> He carries it everywhere, like a security blanket.<br> But with ski boots and a kicky beret.<br> Yeah, it's cute.<br> Why does he have it again? So he's got a doll.<br> So what? Unless you' re afraid he's gonna grow up to be.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in show business.<br> This wouldn't have to do with the fact.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that he's being raised by two women? You know what? It's fine.<br> If you' re okay with the Barbie thing, so am l.<br> Give Daddy the Barbie.<br> Give me the Barbie.<br> Don't you wanna play with a monster truck? No? Okay.<br> How about a Dino-Soldier? You are so pathetic.<br> Why can't your son just play with his doll? I gotta go to work.<br> Has anybody seen my left boob? I loved that movie.<br> Here it is.<br> What are you doing? I' m sorry.<br> It just felt nice.<br> Answer the phone.<br> I only got one arm.<br> You should do stuff for me.<br> Get me a sweater.<br> Just do it! It's Janice.<br> And if I get it, I'll have to see her tonight.<br> That's great.<br> I'll have to see her tonight.<br> Why don't you want to see Janice? Last night at dinner, when the meals came.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took all my tomatoes.<br> And that's bad.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because you hate chicken piccata? You didn't want to share your tomatoes.<br> Tomatoes are very important to you.<br> Suddenly, we were this "couple.<br> " And this alarm started going off in my head.<br> "Run for your life! Get out of the building! " Men are unbelievable.<br> What is it with you people? The minute you feel something, you have to run away? I know.<br> That-- That's why I don't want to go tonight.<br> I' m afraid I'll say something stupid.<br> You mean that "guy thing" where you act mean and distant.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>until we break up with you? You know about that? What do I do? I wanna get past this.<br> I don't want to be afraid of commitment.<br> I want to go through the tunnel to the other side! Where there's no fear of commitment.<br> Do we have any-- Do we have any thoughts here? I've never been through the tunnel myself because.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you' re not allowed through with more than one girl in the car.<br> But it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else.<br> Face your fear.<br> Fear of heights? Go to the top of the building.<br> You' re afraid of bugs.<br> Get a bug.<br> You have a fear of commitment.<br> So I say you go in there and you be the most committed guy there ever was! Amazingly, that makes sense.<br> -Do you think? -Oh, yeah! Go for it, man! Jump off the high dive! Stare down the barrel of the gun! Pee into the wind! If I' m staring down the barrel of a gun.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I' m gonna be pretty much peeing every which way.<br> It's your audition from this morning! Can I use the phone? Sure, that's what it's there for.<br> Emergencies and pretend agents.<br> Come on, baby! Come on! Hi.<br> I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.<br> Okay, she's in her car.<br> I'll have to patch you through.<br> very nice touch.<br> Okay, go ahead.<br> Talk, talk, talk! Hi, Annie? Fantastic.<br> You got it! Will he work for scale, you ask me? Well, I don't know about that.<br> Except that I do and he will.<br> Great.<br> Oh, you are such a sweetheart.<br> I would love to have lunch with you! How about we have lunch next-- Went through a tunnel.<br> Unbelievable.<br> Oh, thank you so much! It was really fun.<br> I mean, I've never talked on a car phone before.<br> You are so amazing! Could you do me this huge favor? There's another audition I want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.<br> I don't know.<br> It was fun one time, but-- Please? It would just be this one more.<br> Well, actually it's two.<br> Two? Well, really it's three.<br> Please? You' re so good at it.<br> I love you.<br> Okay.<br> But just these three, right? No, it's four.<br> So how come you wanted to eat in tonight? Because I wanted.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to give you this.<br> Are you a puppy! Contact paper! What do you say when someone you' re sleeping with.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>gives you contact paper? Wait, there's more.<br> See, the contact paper is to go.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in your brand new drawer! See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.<br> You didn't have to do this.<br> Yes, I did.<br> Yes, I did.<br> Because you' re my girlfriend.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and that's what girlfriends should get.<br> Well, I gotta buy a vowel.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because, oh, my God! Who would've thought that someday.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer? Well, not me.<br> But that's what's happened.<br> And there's more.<br> We should take a trip.<br> We should? We' re a couple, and that's what couples do.<br> And I wanna meet your parents.<br> We should take a trip with your parents! I don't think we need to because you' re tripping me out right now! Are you okay? No, I am.<br> I actually am! This is amazing.<br> My entire life, I have feared this place.<br> And now that I' m here, it's like, what was the big deal? I could probably say, "Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.<br> You probably want us to move in together? -It doesn't scare me! -Yeah, well it scares me! I' m not even divorced yet! You just invited me over here for pasta.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and now you' re talking about moving in together.<br> And I wasn't even that hungry.<br> You know what? It's getting really late, and I should just-- Don't go! I've scared you! I've said too much! I' m hopeless and awkward and desperate for love! Hey, Janice, it's me.<br> I wanted to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.<br> Here you go, honey.<br> This will help.<br> So I catch up to her and she says.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>this relationship's going too fast and we have to slow down.<br> That is never good.<br> Then I got all.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>needy and clingy.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Maybe it's not so bad.<br> How did you leave it? She said she'd call me.<br> Oh, God.<br> Welcome to our side of the tunnel.<br> This ice cream tastes like crap, by the way.<br> Well, it's that low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.<br> We save the real stuff for the truly terminal cases.<br> When you' re getting screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low fat.<br> Yeah, you do.<br> You don't think I' m terminal? Not at all.<br> You' re not terminal.<br> We just need some damage control.<br> Okay.<br> Should I call her? It's a critical time.<br> If you feel yourself reaching for that phone.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>go shopping, get your butt in a bubble bath.<br> If you want her back, you have got to start acting aloof.<br> She has to know you' re not needy.<br> So what you have to do is.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you have to accidentally run into her on purpose.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then act aloof.<br> So I' m not gonna lose her? Oh, honey, you' re not a total loser.<br> I said, "So I' m not gonna lose her?" Guess who's here! It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben! Real American hero I'm G.<br>I.<br> Joe! Drop the Barbie.<br> Drop the Barbie.<br> G.<br>I.<br> Joe? You really think he'll fall for that? G.<br>I.<br> Joe? Cool! Can I play? Look, Ben! It's a toy that protects U.<br>S.<br> oil interests overseas! Go, Joe! -There you are! -No, it's not.<br> Sorry.<br> But, Phoebe, wait, wait.<br> Phoebe! Oh, Joey! Oh, okay! See, I didn't recognize you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in those pants.<br> That Tv movie I went in for, did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.<br> Yes, they called! You didn't get it! Okay? I mean, you didn't get it.<br> I' m sorry.<br> I' m sorry.<br> That's okay.<br> These things happen.<br> But they shouldn't happen.<br> You know what? You' re in a terrible, terrible business.<br> I don't want to be the person who makes you look like that.<br> I' m okay.<br> See? Now you' re sad and creepy.<br> I' m sorry.<br> I quit.<br> No, no, you can't quit! You' re the best agent I ever had.<br> Rejection is part of being an actor.<br> You can't take it personal.<br> They said they'd never met an ltalian actor with a worse ltalian accent.<br> They actually said that? Oh, God, there's that face again.<br> See? I can't do this job! This is why you have to do this job! Agents always lie.<br> Estelle just says stuff like, "They went another way.<br> " But this? I can use this.<br> I can work on a new accent.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> If it helps you, okay.<br> Yeah.<br> You'll never get me, Joe! No, thank you.<br> What are you doing here? Just a bit of shopping.<br> How have you been? Are you being British? Not anymore.<br> Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood.<br> Were you here waiting for me? I' m just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>picking up some things for a party.<br> Barley? What kind of party serves barley? I' m sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.<br> Where is this party? Here in Chelsea.<br> Whose party is it? A woman's.<br> What woman? Chelsea.<br> Either you' re seeing somebody behind my back.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>which would make you the world's biggest jerk.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or you' re pretending to see somebody.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>which makes you so pathetic I could cry right here! So which of these two guys do you want to be? Can I be that guy? Okay, we got some more good rejections.<br> Lots of stuff to work on.<br> Okay.<br> Shoot.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, the zoo commercial.<br> I didn't get it? They said that you "weren't believable as a human being.<br> " So you can work on that.<br> Great.<br> What else? The off-Broadway-play people said that you were "pretty but dumb.<br> " Oh, no wait.<br> I' m sorry.<br> That's "pretty dumb.<br> " Look, it's okay, no, no, no.<br> Really.<br> Look.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I really appreciate this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I' m gonna have to go back to Estelle.<br> Don't get me wrong.<br> You' re a better agent than she is.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but at least with her, I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.<br> Yeah, no, I understand.<br> You do? Thanks.<br> Okay.<br> Sorry.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Did you make all that stuff up to get out of being my agent? Oh, he caught me.<br> I am so busted! That's what I suspected! And then I just, you know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store.<br> My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof," not "a doof.<br> " I've actually ruined this, haven't l? Is it time for the good ice cream now? Yeah, it is.<br> You know what? Everything's gonna be okay.<br> Can you hold on for a second? What do I do? I don't know.<br> This is unprecedented.<br> If we did what you did, a man would never call.<br> I got it! Pretend you just woke up.<br> That'll throw her off! -Be sleepy! -Yes! And grumpy! What are you--? Stop naming dwarfs! I' m so glad that you called.<br> I know I've been acting really weird lately.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it's just because I' m crazy about you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I just got stupid and scared.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and stupid a couple more times.<br> And I' m sorry.<br> Really? Really? He's so lucky.<br> If Janice were a guy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.<br> I love you too.<br> It's so unfair! G.<br>I.<br> Joe? G.<br>I.<br> Joe?! I don't know what to tell you guys.<br> That's the doll he chose.<br> What'd you do, dip it in sugar? Look, G.<br>I.<br> Joe's in, Barbie's out.<br> And if you guys can't deal with it, that's just your too bad.<br> What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbie.<br> Big deal.<br> You used to dress up like a woman.<br> What? The way you used to dress up in Mom's clothes? What are you talking about? The big hat, the pearls, the little pink handbag? Okay.<br> You are totally making this up.<br> How can you not remember? You made us call you "Bea"? Oh, God.<br> I've literally never been this happy.<br> Wasn't there a little song? Oh, please, God, let there be a song.<br> There was no song.<br> There was no song.<br> I am Bea -I drink tea-- -That's enough.<br> Won't you.<br> Won't you.<br> Won't you.<br> Won't you dance around with me? I am Bea I drink tea Won't you dance around with--? Ross?   <br>
