I used to want to be a vet.<br> Then I found out you have to put your hands into cows.<br> Are you okay? Just a tough day at work, you know? Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.<br> I know this jacket.<br> This is Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he? He's here, isn't he? -Maybe.<br> -Don't toy with me.<br> Geller! Hey, Fun Bobby! Hey! You been working out? Not at all.<br> I love this guy! I'm so excited to hear you're back with my sister.<br> -You and me both! -So what'd I miss? We were trying to make Joey feel better.<br> Need me to pick you up? No, I'm all right, man.<br> No, I'm picking you up! No, seriously.<br> I don't need you to It still works! Before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gonna go.<br> See you later, babe.<br> Public display of affection coming up.<br> You can avert your eyes.<br> See you.<br> Fun Bobby is so great.<br> Oh, isn't he? I think this time it may work with him.<br> He makes me feel so good.<br> I've been feeling so lousy lately.<br> No job, no boyfriend.<br> Well, at least my cup is half full.<br> Half full of love! For our two-week anniversary, he's taking me to his cousin's cabin.<br> Cabin of love! We went through a lot of wine tonight.<br> I only had two glasses.<br> I had a glass.<br> Two.<br> I had one glass.<br> I had a mug full in this  I-got-boned-at-the- Museum-of-Natural-History mug.<br> Okay, so that's what? Two bottles.<br> And yet somehow we went through five? So what? So he drank a lot tonight.<br> Now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a drink.<br> And did you notice how he always starts his stories with  "Okay, I was so wasted!" or "Oh, we were so bombed!" "So I wake up and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut!" Have you been with him when he wasn't drinking? We just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink.<br> How do you go to a wine-tasting without having a drink? Or to a club, or to the zoo.<br> Rach, does this have nonfat milk? I don't know, taste it.<br> Too late, you already had some.<br> What do you say we make these coffees lrish? Cake! Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.<br> It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff "lrish" lately.<br> I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> Maybe it's none of my business.<br> Or maybe it is, I don't know.<br> I'm worried about you.<br> This isn't the first time somebody said something to me about this.<br> But I always made excuses, like "I'm just a social drinker.<br>" Or "Come on, it's Flag Day!" So, what are you saying now? I guess I'm saying  I'll try and quit.<br> I like that you worry about me.<br> So, what's going on? I am gonna try and quit drinking.<br> Oh! Why? Guess who's back in show biz! Lorne Greene? No.<br> You know why? Because he's dead.<br> Oh, no.<br> This is gonna seem bittersweet now  but Joey, that's who! My agent called with an audition for Days Of Our Lives! Kick ass! We have to celebrate! We should do a soap opera theme.<br> We could all sleep together, then one of us could get amnesia! When do you get off? We'll do something tonight.<br> Well, actually, I'm already done.<br> But I kind of got plans.<br> You have other friends? I have a date.<br> What? With a man? No, with Crule John.<br> What's so strange about me having a date? With Crule John.<br> What about Ross? You're still mad because he made that list? No, no, I'm not mad at him.<br> I'm not really "anything" at him anymore.<br> -What are you talking about? -I don't know.<br> Whatever I was feeling, I'm  not.<br> But you guys came so close.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You'll have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.<br> Here he is.<br> Guys, this is Russ.<br> I'm not saying you're not talented.<br> You're very talented.<br> But with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left.<br> Honey, give me a break, will you? I'll talk to you later.<br> There's my favorite client! So tell me, darling, how was the audition? I think it went well.<br> I got a callback for Thursday.<br> Joey! Have you ever seen me ecstatic? Well, here it is.<br> Okay! Listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.<br> The casting lady Oh, isn't Lori a doll? She's great.<br> But I kind of got the feeling that she was sort of coming on to me.<br> And I definitely would get the part if I were to, you know.<br> If I sent the little general in.<br> I see! Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's going on and straighten it out.<br> Lori, please.<br> Hi, darling! How about Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver? Isn't he terrific? Okay, doll, talk to you later.<br> You're gonna have to sleep with her.<br> -What's the matter? -Fun Bobby.<br> What? Isn't he sober? Oh, he's sober all right.<br> Turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.<br> All right, here you go, sweetie.<br> Thanks.<br> You wanna hear something funny? Oh, God, yes! There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.<br> That is funny.<br> I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out walking around the neighborhood.<br> and I am walking, and I am walking, and I am walking So you are saying you are walking But apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.<br> So it's help for fat Â¡Â­Â¡Â­ Â¡Â­Â¡Â­as well as funny.<br> Don't you have to be at your interview? Oh, yeah.<br> See you guys.<br> Bye ridiculously dull Bobby.<br> Oh, my God.<br> He's not that bad.<br> Not that bad? Did you not hear the hammer story? Okay, don't get all squinky.<br> Maybe it's the kind of story where you had to be there.<br> But I'm gonna be there! For the rest of my life.<br> I can't dump him.<br> I made him quit drinking.<br> I made him dull! Don't say that.<br> He's probably always been dull.<br> You just, you know set it free.<br> Hey, Ross.<br> Hi, Russ.<br> I've got two more tables to clean, and then we'll go.<br> I'll just sit here and chat with your friend-type people.<br> Rachel?

She's upset because she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.<br> All right.<br> Listen, Pheebs.<br> This is gonna be okay.<br> Ross, Russ.<br> Russ, Ross.<br> Are you a friend of Rachel's? Yes.<br> Yes, I am.<br> Are you a friend of Rachel's? Actually, I'm kind of a you know a date-type thing of Rachel's.<br> A date? I'm her date.<br> Oh! Oh, you're a.<br> Oh, you're the date.<br> This is actually good  because if we lose Ross, we have a spare.<br> Oh! You are the paleontologist.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I am.<br> And you are a.<br> Periodontist.<br> See? Now they're as different as night and Iater that night.<br> Well, I am going to get a beverage.<br> It was nice meeting you.<br> Ditto.<br> Well, I met Russ.<br> Hey, I didn't know we were seeing other people.<br> Well, we're not seeing each other, so.<br> For your information, there's a woman at the museum who's curator of moths and other winged things who's let it be known that she is drawn to me, much like a you know.<br> I've kept her at bay, but if this is the deal This is the deal.<br> Okay, well, have a nice evening.<br> Russ, you ready? She's dating? She's dating? Yes, but did you see who she was dating? What do you mean? -Do you not see it? -See what? I don't know what she sees in that goober! It takes him, what? Like, I don't know  hello, a week to get out a sentence? It's annoying, isn't it? You didn't get the part or ltaly called and said it was hungry? The part's mine if I want it.<br> Oh, my God! If I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.<br> Oh, my God? Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this.<br> Ten years! I mean, Days of our Lives.<br> That's actually on television! What are you gonna do? I guess I could sleep with her.<br> I mean.<br> How can I do that? I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.<br> I've never slept with someone for a part.<br> Well, is she Sorry.<br> Is she good-looking? She's totally good-looking.<br> If I met her in a bar  I'd be buying her breakfast.<br> After having slept with her.<br> Maybe this isn't such a big deal.<br> The way that I see it is, you get a great job, and you get to have sex! Throw in a tree and a fat guy, and you've got Christmas! I just don't think that I want it that way, though.<br> I mean, let's say I do make it, all right? I'll always look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or you know, the little general.<br> Didn't you used to call it "the little major"? After Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.<br> Something from the bar? Yes, I would like something.<br> No.<br> No, thank you.<br> If you wanna drink, it's okay with me.<br> I've gotta get used to it.<br> No, no, really.<br> I wouldn't feel right about it.<br> Just some water, please.<br> -So my refrigerator light's out.<br> -Scotch on the rocks with a twist!
