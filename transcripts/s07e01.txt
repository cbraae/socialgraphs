Oh, big talk! Why don't you come here and say that to me?

Oh, no, not that.<br> We never had bonus night.<br> -A what? -You know, bonus night.<br> Two people break up, but they get back together for one night.<br> One night, just sex? No strings attached? Yeah, yeah, we never had that.<br> No.<br> Okay, this is getting a little crazy.<br> I'm sure it would be amazing.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I really don't think it would be a good idea.<br> I really.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>really.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>don't.<br> 'Sup? 'Sup, dude? Take whatever you want, just don't hurt me.<br> You playing a little PlayStation, huh? That's whack.<br> PlayStation is whack.<br> 'Sup with the whack PlayStation, 'sup? Come on, am I 1 9 or what? Yes, on a scale of one to ten, ten being the dumbest a person can look.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you are definitely 1 9.<br> Come on, really.<br> How old? Young.<br> You're a man-child, okay? Now get changed, everybody's ready.<br> And please, please, keep my underwear.<br> Thanks.<br> You've had a lot of sex, right? When, today? Some, not a lot.<br> The reason I'm asking is because I had kind of a-- I was unable to-- I really wanted to, but I couldn't-- There was an incident.<br> Don't worry about that, man.<br> That happens.<br> -It's happened to you? -Yeah, once.<br> -Well, what'd you do? -I did it anyway.<br> Phoebe, come on, let's go.<br> Come on.<br> Why aren't you dressed yet? I wrote the best song for your wedding.<br> Check this out.<br> If you get ready now, you can play.<br> -Really?! -Yes.<br> That's so exciting! Thanks, Mon.<br> But if you touch my guitar again, I'll have to pound on you a little bit.<br> Fair enough.<br> Get ready.<br> I'll get everybody.<br> Finally we can start celebrating my-- I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past.<br> Okay, Monica, Mon.<br> Okay, what you just saw-- Can I ask you just a little question? Why tonight? I waited my whole life to be engaged.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and unlike some, I only plan on doing this once.<br> Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but I hoped tonight could just be about that.<br> But it is just about that.<br> Now it's about you getting back together.<br> See, you kind of stole my thunder.<br> We did not steal your thunder.<br> We are not getting back together.<br> Yeah, no, and you know what? Nobody even saw.<br> That's true.<br> -We just kissed.<br> -It was just a kiss.<br> You guys kissed?! What does this mean?! Are you back together? Can I sing at your wedding? Thunder being stolen.<br> -Phoebe, it's nothing.<br> -Let's not make a big deal of this.<br> It was a one-time thing.<br> It doesn't even matter.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I cannot believe you guys are talking about this.<br> Problems in the bedroom are between a man and woman.<br> All right? Now, Chandler is doing the best he can.<br> I don't think that's what they were talking about.<br> What a great night.<br> Chandler can't do it, they kissed.<br> -What? -You guys kissed? This is huge.<br> No, it's not huge.<br> People thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we're stealing her thunder, which we aren't.<br> We're still talking about it.<br> That, and Chandler's problem.<br> Monica, listen, listen.<br> Would you feel better if we stopped talking about Ross and Rachel? -That would be lovely.<br> -You got it.<br> Now, I can pass for 1 9, right? Yes, you can pass for 1 9.<br> -Really? -Yes.<br> -Seriously? -Seriously? Seriously, no.<br> Okay? You can play your own age, which is 31 .<br> I'm 30! Joey, you are not.<br> You're 31 .<br> Oh, crap! So, the Plaza.<br> We'll get some mai tais? Maybe no more for you though.<br> You know, I think I don't feel like going to the Plaza.<br> Monica, this is ridiculous.<br> I don't want to talk about it.<br> I don't.<br> Especially with you.<br> That is whack.<br> I'll play it at the wedding.<br> We'll see if they actually let you play.<br> They tell you anything you want to hear.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Iike, "You look 1 9.<br> " Then they just take it away, like, "No, you don't.<br> " Monica won't take this away.<br> -Wouldn't she? -Would she? Would she? You ate my candy bar! Guess who.<br> Hey, I just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air.<br> What did Monica mean: "I don't want to talk," especially with me? Why not especially you and me? We were both kissing.<br> Still thinking about it? I'm serious.<br> What did she mean by that? "Especially you.<br> " -Who cares? -I care.<br> And so do l.<br> I have to talk to her.<br> Will you let me get changed? Am I going to let you watch me? No.<br> I can't believe her.<br> It's just so typical.<br> I know you're upset, but don't forget there is going to be a wedding.<br> You are going to throw the bouquet, and then a honeymoon.<br> -Maybe in Paris.<br> -Paris? We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.<br> Keep talking.<br> We will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>not just because it's romantic, but because I can.<br> I love you.<br> Don't say anything, you might scare it away.<br> It's Paris.<br> Who knows we're here? Hi, Pheebs.<br> What's up? You said I could sing at your wedding, so I need a small deposit.<br> You know, some good-faith money to hold the date.<br> We're not giving you a deposit for our wedding.<br> Oh, I see.<br> They break your heart, don't they? You know, I don't really need their permission.<br> You want to sing at their wedding, sing at their wedding.<br> Yeah, and if you want to look 1 9, then you-- You got to do something about your eyes.<br> What's wrong with my eyes? They give you away.<br> There's too much wisdom in there.<br> Put some tea bags on them for 1 5 minutes.<br> -That'll get rid of my wisdom? -Maybe 1 0 minutes for you.<br> Give her the deposit, give her the ring.<br> I don't care.<br> What did you mean when you said.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me? What a great apology.<br> And you accept it.<br> Bye-bye.<br> No, seriously, what was the "especially me" part about? Let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.<br> Hey, here's a thought.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Monica, what are you talking about? My sweet 1 6.<br> You went to third base with my cousin Charlie.<br> Third base.<br> It was all everybody could talk about.<br> The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring.<br> We had a caricaturist.<br> Whenever I get married Guess who won 't be asked to sing Somebody named Geller And somebody else named Bing Monica, your sweet 1 6 was like a million years ago.<br> Yet here you are doing it again.<br> I don't want to steal your stupid thunder.<br> Why else would you have made out with Ross? Got me.<br> Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.<br> It ain't gonna happen.<br> It'd be nice if I could have this night.<br> I never wanted any part of your night.<br> No one was supposed to see us.<br> Is that why you did it in the secret hallway, where nobody ever goes? Rachel, I've been thinking.<br> I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.<br> I'm calling it off.<br> Way to save your dignity, my man.<br> Mon, why, why would I ever want to take away from your night? I don't know, maybe you feel a little resentful.<br> Maybe you thought you'd get married first.<br> Maybe you can't stand.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that your formerly fat friend is getting married first.<br> Oh, wow, that-- You know what? That is so unfair.<br> Now I want to steal your thunder.<br> Come on, Ross.<br> Let's go have sex! I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night.<br> Well, somebody should.<br> Look, if we're gonna do this-- We're not.<br> She's just gonna think we are.<br> I see, so everybody wins.<br> -Who is it? -It's Monica, open up.<br> Okay, Ross, stop it.<br> Please, wait a minute.<br> Yeah, you like that, baby? May we help you? I wanted to say I hope you have sex, and I hope you get back together.<br> I warn you, the night you announce your engagement.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant.<br> How is that ever going to happen? Do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight? -I know why.<br> -You don't.<br> -Okay, why? -Because I was sad.<br> What do you mean? Look, I am so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so happy for you guys.<br> But you getting married reminds me of the fact that I'm not.<br> I'm not even close.<br> Maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better.<br> I know that that's dumb, but you were so depressed.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>when Ross got married, you slept with Chandler.<br> I don't care, she slept with me.<br> Anyway, sweetie, I am so sorry I ruined your night.<br> I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.<br> I'm gonna take off.<br> -Congratulations, man.<br> -Thanks.<br> And Rachel.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>what can I say? You missed your chance.<br> From now on, the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.<br> We thought Phoebe would leave But she just stayed and stayed That's right, I'm here all night And Chandler will never get-- Hey, here's a dollar.<br> Consider it a deposit.<br> Please sing at our wedding.<br> Thank you.<br> Now who will perform the ceremony Who will perform the cer-- I'll pound on him in the morning.<br>   <br>
