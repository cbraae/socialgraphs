                    			- Hey, guys.<br> - Hey.<br> Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.<br> That place in Vermont? You can take a hint.<br> You can't go away this weekend.<br> It's Emma's birthday.<br> We're having a party.<br> Can't you have the party when we get back? No.<br> It won't be her real birthday.<br> Gee, if only she were 1 and had no idea what the hell a birthday was.<br> Come on, you guys, this is really important to us.<br> Sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away you know, to reconnect, emotionally.<br> - There's this thing I really want us to do.<br> I read about it in Maxim.<br> Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day? Yeah, we want everyone to be there.<br> As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.<br> And, I mean, you know, you guys, this is a big deal.<br> How can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle? All right, we'll stay.<br> We can just drive up after the party.<br> Fine.<br> But if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that.<br> The One With the Cake You know, Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house.<br> And then he would draw a treasure map to help me find them all.<br> I love family traditions like that.<br> When Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food.<br> - Hey, guys.<br> - Hi.<br> - I brought the camera for Emma's video.<br> - Oh, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she's 18.<br> - Oh, cool.<br> - Wow, it's like a time capsule.<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet with friends who, right now, are just, like, babies.<br> And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people.<br> That's the hope.<br> - So is Emma awake yet? - No, it's still naptime.<br> - But she'll be up soon.<br> - Where's Joey? I said, it's still naptime.<br> - Hey, there's Uncle Joey.<br> - Hey.<br> Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday.<br> - Eighteen, huh? - Joey, no! What? What? It's for her hot friends.<br> When they see this, you'll be 52.<br> And starting to think about settling down.<br> Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on? Love to.<br> Yeah.<br> - We were supposed to bring presents? - Yeah.<br> I wrote Emma a song.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> How was I supposed to know? - Joey, it's a birthday party.<br> - Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old.<br> What's the point? The other day she laughed for an hour at a cup.<br> Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it, dressed as a farmer.<br> And he's standing next to this cow, and the cow says, "El-moo.<br>" Man, that's a funny cup.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> - Where's the birthday girl? - Oh, she's still napping.<br> She was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening.<br> I know you guys really want to get to Vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you.<br> But it really is to us, okay? Emma will never have a first birthday again.<br> You're right.<br> We're sorry.<br> Let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started! She didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her.<br> Are you frigging kidding me, Greene? - Hi! - Hey! - I'm so glad you came.<br> - I can't believe Emma's already 1.<br> I remember your first birthday.<br> Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you.<br> He pulled on his testicles so hard we had to take him to the emergency room.<br> There's something you didn't know about your dad.<br> Hey, Mr.<br> and Mrs.<br> Geller.<br> Let me help you with that.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Oh, man, this is great, huh? The three of us together again.<br> You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us.<br> Which one are you? - I can't believe Emma's still asleep.<br> - I know.<br> What are we gonna do? I've got a plan.<br> I've got a plan.<br> I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs.<br> You're gonna scream out, and that'll wake her up.<br> I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica.<br> Hey, Pheebs? You know what? I was thinking since you wrote a song maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents.<br> So you're gonna hit on her? No, no, no.<br> My talents as an actor.<br> You know, I could, like, maybe I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books.<br> Or you could stick a fork in an apple.<br> - Hey, I think Emma might like it.<br> - Oh, Emma might like what? - My present.<br> - What did you get her? - We prepared performances.<br> - Separate performances.<br> But equally real.<br> That sounds like fun.<br> People are getting a little antsy waiting for Emma to wake up from her nap.<br> So would you mind performing them once now? - Sure, yeah! - Okay.<br> Okay.<br> All right.<br> Everybody, let's get this party started.<br> Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.<br> Oh, great.<br> Aren't you gonna be embarrassed having nothing prepared? I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.<br> So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us? I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.<br> Oh, okay.<br> Which one? Well, it's one of her favorites.<br> "Riding the Storm Out: Coping With Postpartum Depression.<br>" Love You Forever.<br> "Love You Forever, by Robert Munsch.<br> Published by Firefly Books.<br> Printed in Mexico.<br> A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.<br> And while she held him, she sang, 'I'll love you forever.<br> I'll like you for always.<br> As long as I'm living my baby you'll be.<br>'" "And while he rocked her, he sang: 'I'll love you forever.<br> I'll like you for always.<br> As long as I'm living my baby you'll be.<br>'" Oh, wow! That was amazing.<br> Thank you so much for that gift.<br> I was not ready for this today.<br> - Amazing.<br> Amazing.<br> - Phoebe, I'm sorry.<br> - Phoebe has prepared something as well.<br> - That's right.<br> I prepared a song for Emma, from my heart to hers.<br> For there's no greater gift than the gift of music.<br> Emma! Your name poses a dilemma.<br> 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna (he played the commanding officer in Rambo) Happy birthday Emma! Is that it? No, of course not.<br> No, I've also, you know, prepared a reading.<br> "Sex and the Single Mother.<br>" - "Finding your G-spot.<br>" - Oh, no, no, no! Hello, Emma.<br> Happy 18th birthday.<br> Right now, that seems so far away, Yes.<br> You'll be all grown up by then, and we'll be Well, your grandfather and I might not be here.<br> That's true.<br> This message could be coming to you from beyond the grave, Emma.<br> - After all, my parents died very young.<br> - And my cholesterol's off the charts.<br> Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too.<br> Okay, cut! Great.<br> Great.<br> That was just - Yeah.<br> - Oh, good.<br> Ross, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake.<br> - It's in a box in the fridge.<br> - Okay, sure.<br> You're gonna love this cake.<br> I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's.<br> Oh, my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I used to hitchhike there when I was a kid.<br> Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes in all different shapes.<br> And if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing.<br> - Did you do a picture of Emma? - Yes.<br> On a cake shaped like a bunny.<br> Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say, for bachelorette parties? Ross, what are you talking? Oh, my God! They put my baby's face on a penis! Now it's a party! Wait, you guys, this isn't funny.<br> If I wanted this cake to be a disaster, I would have baked it myself! Is it okay that I still think it looks delicious? - Jack, look at this.<br> - I know what you're thinking, Judy.<br> The resemblance is uncanny.<br> I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.<br> No, no, this is not what I ordered, okay? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday.<br> And I need a bunny cake right now! Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis so we could put it on the bunny.<br> That is a weird sentence.<br> Oh, believe you me, I am going to bring this cake back.<br> I don't even want it in my home.<br> Don't touch it! I'm so confused! Yes, I still want my daughter's picture, but on a bunny cake! Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts! To be fair, this one does have nuts.<br> Mon, it was nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could get the cake.<br> - It was nice of her to pull my hair till I dropped the key.<br> Well, while we're waiting, you could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Okay? Hi, Emma.<br> It's the year 2020.<br> Are you still enjoying your nap? We're Aunt Monica and Uncle Chandler, by the way.<br> You may not recognize us because we haven't spoken to your parents in 17 years.<br> We used to be married.<br> But then we missed a weekend away together, and things kind of unraveled because of you.<br> Happy birthday.<br> Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now.<br> We seriously have to go if we want to get to Vermont.<br> - The last train leaves in a half-hour.<br> - And I have a massage client soon.<br> You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.<br> I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute.<br> Monica, remember the frosting, huh? All right, five more minutes.<br> Hello? Oh, no, what happened? Okay, okay, where are you? Okay, I'll be right there.<br> Was that Emma? Is she up? Rachel got pulled over for speeding.<br> She forgot her license.<br> I have to bring it to her.<br> - lf you're leaving, I'm definitely going.<br> - Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us! We've been complaining the longest! No, wait, you guys.<br> No, you can't leave.<br> Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up.<br> How do you think she'll feel when she comes back and you're gone? I don't know.<br> You'll tell us on Monday.<br> Joey, you're in charge, okay? You make sure nobody leaves.<br> Got it! Hey! Where do you think you're going? To the bathroom.<br> Well, the rest of you get comfortable, because we are gonna be here for a - Wait, there's a window in there.<br> - No! He's not getting away that easy! What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.<br> - No, it did not.<br> - No.<br> Well, we'd better get going.<br> It's late.<br> Jack can't drive at night anymore.<br> He has trouble staying in his lane.<br> Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene.<br> The papers thought it was a hate crime.<br> - Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.<br> - Okay.<br> - Bye.<br> Bye, dear.<br> - Nighty-night.<br> - Nighty-night.<br> - Bye.<br> - How could you just let them leave? - Hey, hey, hey.<br> I'm not gonna mess with Jack.<br> He's a great man.<br> He fought for our country.<br> No, he didn't.<br> He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.<br> Well, that's it.<br> He's the last one to go.<br> I'm locking you guys in.<br> You do know I can just turn them the other way around, right? Oh, I forgot you used to live here.<br> - Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.<br> - Hey.<br> - So how'd your audition go today? - What audition? - The one I told you about last week.<br> What? You never said anything about an audition.<br> Let me start over.<br> I just got a call about an audition.<br> I think you can still make it.<br> It's down at the Astor Theater, and you need to have a monologue prepared.<br> A monologue? I don't have a I got it.<br> So I'm gonna take off.<br> - What? - No, wait! You don't get to leave.<br> I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute.<br> And we paid for a room that we're supposed to be in right now! Well, okay, now only one of us has to stay with Emma.<br> Okay, and as the person who realized that, I get to go.<br> No, no, no.<br> No.<br> No.<br> Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.<br> Oh, I got it.<br> Okay, everyone pick a number from one to 10, all right? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.<br> - Okay, 10.<br> - Okay, Monica picks 10.<br> I call nine.<br> Anyone else? - No, let's just draw straws.<br> - Okay.<br> Or we could flip a coin and multiply the answer - I'm begging you to stop.<br> - Right.<br> Okay, how about this? We got wind-up toys for Emma.<br> We can make them race, and whoever comes in last stays.<br> Yeah, let's do that! That sounds more fun than the thing we were gonna do in Vermont! - Okay, everybody, pick your toys! - Okay.<br> I want the dolphin! - That's a bear! - I'm too excited! Phoebe, you get the bear.<br> Joey, you get the robot.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> - And Chandler and I get the dog.<br> And the race is going to go from here to here.<br> Now, the one who comes in last stays! Okay, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys.<br> - Okay.<br> On your mark, get set, go! - Go! Go! Come on, robot! What are you barking at? Well, how is that gonna help? I bought you! How did I forget that that's all you do? Way to go, robot! Good job, Alan.<br> - Hey, good race, you guys.<br> - Yeah, see you later.<br> No.<br> No, no.<br> Wait.<br> We didn't lose.<br> The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser.<br> Well, our dog never crossed the finish line.<br> So technically They left.<br> There isn't time to go to the bakery.<br> We're gonna come home.<br> Everybody left? All right.<br> Well, just tell Emma that we'll be there as soon as we can.<br> Bye.<br> - Rachel! - Oh, God, sorry! I can't believe they gave you a ticket.<br> You're such a good driver.<br> - Emma's awake.<br> - Yeah? I can't believe this.<br> This is her first birthday, she's awake, we're not even there.<br> Everybody left.<br> We still have this stupid obscene cake.<br> Hey, maybe I can fix that.<br> You know, try to turn it into something else.<br> Oh, don't even bother.<br> We've already ruined her first birthday.<br> And do you know how important these early experiences are, Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.<br> Rach, she's not gonna remember this.<br> I guess.<br> Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake, singing "Happy Birthday.<br>" And then we would all Hey, get out of the road, you stupid student driver! They have to learn.<br> - Hey.<br> - What? This is not bad.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Look, you made it into a bunny.<br> How did you do that? Well, I just made these two things cheeks.<br> And then I split this to make ears.<br> Well, I am very impressed.<br> Some can sing, some can dance.<br> I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.<br> Now, another way to organize your stuffed animals is by size.<br> I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica? Game? Emma, do you even know it's your birthday today? You're 1.<br> One year old.<br> That's little.<br> That's my girl.<br> That's how old you are.<br> Did I teach her that? Did I just impart wisdom? I want one.<br> Me too.<br> There's no one around.<br> Why don't we just take this one? - And head to Canada.<br> - I was kidding.<br> I wasn't.<br> Let's get going.<br> - Hey, are Ross and Rachel back? - No, not yet.<br> - Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.<br> - What about your massage client? I just felt so bad missing this.<br> So I just slipped him a little something, you know.<br> As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it'll be all right.<br> Okay.<br> If Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time.<br> The whole time.<br> I've been here the whole time.<br> Joey, we just saw you come in.<br> You ran past us on the stairs.<br> I don't care that you left.<br> I'm just glad that you're here.<br> Thanks, you guys.<br> Hey, guys, come on.<br> You gotta see what Emma just did.<br> - What? - Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? Emma, that's right.<br> You're that many.<br> Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.<br> - This means - No! No science camp! Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.<br> Oh, and, Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly.<br> Thanks.<br> Okay, here we go.<br> Emma's first birthday cake.<br> Go ahead, Emma, blow out the candle.<br> Come on, Emma.<br> You can do it.<br> - What's wrong? Are you okay? - Oh, yeah, nothing.<br> These are happy tears.<br> This is just what I wanted.<br> Hey, you made it into a bunny.<br> What is wrong with me? It looked more delicious when it was a penis.<br> - Okay, you ready? - Yeah.<br> - And record.<br> - Okay.<br> Hi, Emma.<br> Well, your first birthday is over, and Go! Go! Come on! Go! Go! Come on! Go! Go, Alan! Run, you hairy bastard!   <br>
