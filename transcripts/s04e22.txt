                    			That was the 10th time I've peed here.<br> It's also the 10th time you've told us.<br> Sorry, it must be hard to hear.<br> It's easier having babies playing "Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder! I am so sick of being pregnant.<br> God! I can't sleep, except on my back, which hurt.<br> So I can't sleep.<br> My only happiness is from a cup of coffee which is decaf because I'm pregnant! You want a cookie? Thank you so much! So, honey, how are those mood swings coming? I haven't had any yet.<br> The One with the Worst Best Man Ever Hey, guys.<br> All right, here's the ring.<br> Yes, yes! A thousand times, yes! Any ideas for the bachelor party? Before rings and bachelor parties, you have to decide who your best man will be.<br> Oh, it's awkward.<br> I already asked Chandler.<br> He got to do it at your first wedding.<br> I figured you'd understand.<br> I've known him longer.<br> I don't have any brothers.<br> I'll never be a best man.<br> You can be the best man when I get married.<br> I'll never get to be a best man! Wait, wait.<br> So you'll be my best man twice, and I won't be yours at all? Of course, you can be my best man.<br> -What about me? You said I could.<br> -I'm not getting married! It's a question for science-fiction writers.<br> I can't believe it's not me.<br> -How could it not be me? -I'm not even You know what? That's it.<br> From now on, Joey will be my best man.<br> Shame about you, though.<br> -Stop it.<br> -What? One of the babies is kicking.<br> That's a good thing.<br> It's not kicking me.<br> It's kicking another baby.<br> Don't make me come in there! Do you have a big bowl I can borrow? There's one under the cabinet.<br> -Why do you need it? -We're having a party tomorrow night.<br> -Are you planning on inviting us? -No.<br> Later! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani! Hormones.<br> How come you're having a party and we're not invited? -It's Ross' bachelor party.<br> -So? Are you bachelors? Are you strippers? Then you're not invited.<br> Then you're not invited to our party either.<br> What party? Phoebe's baby shower.<br> Baby shower? That so doesn't sound like something I want to do.<br> I can't believe I'm going to have a party.<br> That's so great.<br> A party! I don't know why.<br> This is what I got going for the party liquor-wise.<br> -Get a lot of liquor.<br> -Great.<br> In terms of the invite list, I got you, me and Chandler.<br> I'll invite Gunther because we're talking pretty loud.<br> I'll be there.<br> I know it's your party but I'd like to limit the number of museum geeks.<br> Let's not invite any anthropologists.<br> Just the dinosaur dudes.<br> We'll need a six-pack of Zima.<br> Hey, what are you doing? Just planning my bachelor party with my best man.<br> Good luck trying to top the last one.<br> It won't be that difficult since this one won't be in the basement of a Pizza Hut.<br> I'm Ross, I'm Ross.<br> I'm too good for the Hut.<br> I gotta go pick up Ben.<br> Everything sounds great.<br> Keep it on the mellow side.<br> A few guys hanging out.<br> -No strippers or anything.<br> -You got it.<br> See you later.<br> Have fun planning your mellow party.<br> There will be strippers.<br> He didn't say anything about no strippers.<br> He just said, "No strippers.<br>" I chose not to hear that.<br> Look what I got, look what I got! They make these for little people! Little Village People.<br> Look at this one.<br> This is my favorite.<br> That is so sweet.<br> Phoebe will love dressing them.<br> Except she won't be the one who gets to dress them.<br> She won't get to keep the babies.<br> My God, we are throwing the most depressing baby shower! Unless we give her all gifts she can use after her pregnancy.<br> Like regular coffee.<br> Tequila! -A carton of cigarettes! -She doesn't smoke.<br> -It's the thought that counts.<br> -It's a great idea.<br> And those leather pants she's always wanted! She'll love that! What the hell is this? You thought it'd make me feel better? To give me something I can't use for two months? This sucks! -Who gave me this? -Well, l They told me you like them.<br> All right, then I'm wrong.<br> It's a great gift.<br> The best present I ever got! What's my next present? We don't have anything.<br> All right, fine, then this is over.<br> Balloons! -Listen, about the stripper.<br> -Yeah? Good call! So I'll be hosting your next bachelor party? Joey, I'm kind of hoping this will be my last one.<br> A little announcement.<br> I've decided that my best man is my best friend Gunther.<br> What's my last name? Central Perk? Thanks for not marrying Rachel.<br> Hey, Gunther! Don't forget your shirt.<br> What are those? Little party favors.<br> Check it out.<br> Just want everybody to know the position of my best man is still open.<br> So is the position of the bride.<br> Great.<br> Smooth, man.<br> You got some chili on your neck.<br> I just want to say thanks, everyone.<br> This was great! See you guys Monday morning.<br> -Thanks, Joey.<br> -Don't forget your shirt.<br> Hey, museum geeks! Party's over.<br> Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.<br> There you go.<br> Back to your parents' basement.<br> All right.<br> Boys, come on out.<br> Here you go.<br> Look at the birdies! Are those yours? They let you keep chickens and ducks as pets? And I got the duck totally trained too.<br> Stare at the wall.<br> Hardly move.<br> Be white.<br> You are good at that.<br> I had fun tonight.<br> -You throw one hell of a party.<br> -Thanks.<br> It was great meeting you.<br> If any of my friends ever get married or have a birthday or a Tuesday.<br> Yeah, that'd be great.<br> So, I guess, good night.<br> Unless you want to hang around.<br> I'll let you play with my duck.<br> Stripper! The stripper stole the ring! Chandler, get up! The stripper stole the ring! -What? -The ring is gone! Just give me a minute to wake up for this.<br> You lost the ring.<br> You're the worst best man! This isn't funny.<br> I go to sleep, everything's cool.<br> I wake up, the stripper's gone, and the ring is gone! -You slept with her? -Of course! -Hi, guys.<br> -Hi, Phoebe.<br> I wanted to apologize if I seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.<br> Just the hormones.<br> -No, we -Hormones.<br> I wanted to say thank you.<br> It was so sweet.<br> You seem to be doing much better.<br> -How are things going? -Good.<br> Everything's been about me lately.<br> So what's happening with you? We were just talking about me not going to Ross' wedding.<br> It just might be too hard, given the history and all that.<br> This reminds me of the time when I lived on the street.<br> This guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.<br> How is this like that? Well, let's see.<br> It's not really like that.<br> Because that was an actual problem.<br> And yours is just a bunch of high-school crap that nobody really gives! I'm sorry.<br> I just thought Here come the water works.<br> I called the company that sent her, and they don't care.<br> I called 911 and they yelled at me.<br> This is an emergency! I really wanna help you out, but I got plans to go see Titanic so I've got to call 911 to find out what time it starts.<br> Hey, guys.<br> Thanks again for last night.<br> What a great party.<br> The guys from work had a blast.<br> One of them had never been to a bachelor party before.<br> Another one had never been to a party before.<br> So that wedding ring.<br> -Man, that is nice.<br> -Yeah, right? I might pick one of those babies up for myself.<br> Where might one get one of those? When my grandmother first came to this country that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.<br> So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.<br> Absolutely.<br> It's been in my family for generations.<br> Every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.<br> So you might say it's a magic ring.<br> Yeah, the stripper stole it.<br> What? -What did you just -I think I heard what he said.<br> I believe it was, "The stripper stole the ring.<br>" My ring? My wedding ring? The stripper stole my wedding ring? How could this happen? It all started when you said, "Joey, you be my best man!" All right.<br> I'm going to call the cops.<br> I screwed up.<br> But you don't have to turn me in.<br> -Not on you, on the stripper.<br> -I already did that.<br> They said they'd look into it after they solve all the murders.<br> -We'll call the company that sent her.<br> -I did that too.<br> They wouldn't give me her real name.<br> They said if I bother them again, they'd call the police.<br> I said, "You talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring.<br>" So, what are you telling me? There's nothing we can do? -How could this happen? -Look, Ross, I am so sorry.<br> What if we just called her used a fake name and had her come to my office? That sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find! Here's your tea, Phoebe.<br> It's so good.<br> Thanks.<br> -Good.<br> -So glad you like it.<br> What? She made the tea.<br> I think I just had a contraction.<br> -What? -My God! I felt one a few minutes ago.<br> That definitely was one.<br> You can't have the baby here.<br> I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out! It's okay.<br> I'll boil some water and rip up some sheets.<br> It's probably false labor.<br> That can happen near the end.<br> Just get the book.<br> -Get the book! -The book! -The Bible? -I don't know! All right.<br> This is great.<br> You get behind the desk.<br> When she comes in, she won't recognize you because Well, why would she? And then you buzz Ross and l.<br> You be Mr.<br> Gonzales, and I'll be Mr.<br> Wong.<br> Diverse.<br> Anybody call for security? You be cool.<br> Which one is Gunther Central Perk? Joey.<br> Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring.<br> Way to be cool, man.<br> What? There was a ring in a box.<br> After you left, it was gone.<br> You think I stole some ring? We know you took it! Just save yourself the time and confess.<br> Who are you, the Hardy Boys? I don't need to steal a stupid ring.<br> I make $1,600 a week.<br> Any of you guys make that? Marry me.<br> I don't get it.<br> It was in my room all night.<br> She didn't take it.<br> I didn't take it.<br> You didn't take it.<br> Then who did? We're trying to think.<br> I don't get how you know it's false labor.<br> Do you see any babies? -How do you feel? -Okay, I guess.<br> I don't know.<br> I know it's going to be over soon so.<br> But isn't that a good thing? -You said you were sick of this.<br> -I know.<br> Usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing you get to do the mom thing.<br> But I'll be sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.<br> Some moms do that.<br> That's even sadder.<br> Look, I know what I got myself into.<br> It's just that now that they're in me it's like I know them and.<br> It just won't be easy when these babies have to go away.<br> I know, sweetie.<br> But it's not like you won't have anything.<br> You'll have nieces and nephews.<br> That's even better.<br> -Yeah, okay.<br> -No, really.<br> You won't be the one worrying about saving for college.<br> Or yelling at them when they're bad.<br> Or putting them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down.<br> You'll be the one they run away to.<br> The one they talk to about sex.<br> You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.<br> Cool Aunt Phoebe.<br> I am pretty cool.<br> And you know what else? Are they going to love you! They are going to love me.<br> Thanks, you guys.<br> Again.<br> Oh, sweetie.<br> Thanks.<br> What? Just kidding.<br> Oh, my God! Got you again.<br> You're so easy! If anything happens to him The vet said it's a simple procedure.<br> Things can go wrong.<br> What if he doesn't make it? -He will, Joe.<br> -But what if he doesn't? He's such a good duck.<br> I'm so worried about him! Somebody lose a ring? Oh, my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! How's the duck? Just fine.<br> You'll see him in a bit.<br> Great.<br> -Thanks for being so cool.<br> -No, that's all right.<br> You made me your best man and I totally let you down.<br> -It's not your fault.<br> -Yeah, it is.<br> You wouldn't have lost it.<br> Ross, you were right.<br> He should be your best man.<br> -No, you should.<br> -Don't argue.<br> I get to choose my best man.<br> I want both you guys.<br> Really? Both you guys should be up there with me.<br> You two are my I'm lucky to have just one good Thanks, man.<br> I got to go check something, okay? -What a baby! -Total wuss.<br> -How come you're getting Nana's ring? -Mom gave it to me.<br> She said something about it being a wedding ring and that you may not need one.<br> I really didn't need to tell you all that.<br> I don't really think it's fair.<br> I mean, I've always loved that ring.<br> Oh, Mon, I'm sorry.<br> I'd let you have it, but Emily's gotten really attached to it.<br> Thanks.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Thanks.<br> Emily, did you know that that ring spent two days in a duck's colon?   <br>
