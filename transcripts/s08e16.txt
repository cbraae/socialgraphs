The One Where Joey Tells Rachel Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Okay, she's kicking.<br> She's growing inside you.<br> - That was a big one.<br> - That's the youngest girl to reject me.<br> - You guys! - Hey there.<br> Let me ask you.<br> Do you believe in soul mates? Oh, yes, I do.<br> There's one person out there for everyone.<br> You know how you find him? Stop looking.<br> I've stopped looking for Russell Crowe.<br> He'll find me.<br> And you? No.<br> I believe that certain people are more suited for each other, but - Soul mates? I don't think they exist.<br> - Good.<br> - Why? - Well, last night, I met Monica's.<br> What? I had a date with this guy.<br> I swear he's her other half.<br> You don't think there's somebody better suited for Monica than me? Well, what's he like? - He's tall.<br> He has brown hair.<br> - Of course.<br> A tall guy with hair similar to mine? Oh, unknowable universe! - He works with food.<br> - Oh, sure.<br> Older? - Obviously.<br> And he's British.<br> - I was just gonna ask! And he's so centered, and mature and confident.<br> It's so sad they never met.<br> Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear you.<br> Oh, I'm so sorry.<br> Maybe I'm wrong.<br> We're going out again.<br> I'll find out more.<br> He's meant for her, and you're gonna date him? He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.<br> I talked to Joey.<br> I wanted to see you.<br> I still can't believe it.<br> Joey and Rachel? It's like you and me going out, only weirder.<br> I know you're hurting but don't say that again.<br> What if they marry? He'd be the stepfather of my child.<br> You don't need to worry.<br> He'll never tell her how he feels.<br> If he did, you don't know how she'd react.<br> Sure, women never like Joey.<br> I think he's a virgin.<br> - He isn't thinking about going for her.<br> - He's not? All he's thinking about is how you're taking this.<br> It's freaking him out.<br> He wants to move to Vermont.<br> - Why? - He wants to leave the country.<br> He thinks you hate him.<br> Hate him? No, I don't hate him.<br> It's just, it's Rachel.<br> You know? I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you but I don't want you to lose Joey over it.<br> Right now, he needs to know that you're still his friend.<br> Okay, I'll talk to him.<br> I'd do it soon.<br> He just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.<br> - Hi! - Hi.<br> - Chandler, Monica, this is Don.<br> - Hello.<br> Soul mate.<br> - What are you guys doing? - We had lunch at Adriatica.<br> - What's with the sun-dried tomatoes? - I know! Is this 1985? - That's what I said! Isn't it strange? - Not really.<br> What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? On a barbecued-chicken pizza? No? - What restaurants do you like? - Octavio.<br> 27-and-7.<br> - There's this place, Alessandro's.<br> - Oh, my God! I'm the chef! You're kidding! Your food is fantastic! I want to talk about your menu.<br> Anyone want coffee? If you're talking about me, I'll go with you.<br> What are you doing? I swear, I didn't know you guys would be here.<br> You don't believe in soul mates, so I believe in handsome strangers who hit on my wife.<br> Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything'll happen.<br> Phoebe? Good work.<br> He's great.<br> I love him.<br> Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.<br> I understand if you came by to hit me.<br> I deserve it.<br> No, I don't want to hit you.<br> What, then? Kick me? No.<br> Bite me? I don't want to do anything to you.<br> I just want to say I'm not mad at you and that I certainly do not hate you.<br> I just came here to say that.<br> Hey, wait, Ross? You wanna come in for a beer or something? Yeah, sure.<br> You got any beer? All I got is melon stuff that Rachel left.<br> Okay.<br> You need to understand something.<br> I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.<br> Thank you.<br> Anyway, it'll just It'll take me a while to get over her.<br> I'm not sure how to do that.<br> I've never been in love, so What? You're in love with her? - Yeah.<br> I thought you knew that.<br> - No.<br> Look, if it helps, I don't want to feel this way, honest.<br> I just keep thinking, "I'll get over this," you know? But it just keeps getting harder.<br> I don't know what to do, you know? What do I do? - You need to tell her how you feel.<br> - That's the green stuff talking.<br> I'm serious.<br> You need to find out where she is.<br> If she's not where you are, you can start to move on.<br> But what if, and I'm not saying she will be If she is where you are then my feeling weird shouldn't stand in the way.<br> - Are you sure? - Yeah.<br> If she ends up with somebody else the truth is, she couldn't find a better guy.<br> Hey, thanks.<br> - So when are you gonna talk to her? - Oh, my God.<br> I have to tell her.<br> I haven't thought about it.<br> What should I say? I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.<br> What am I gonna say? Yeah, tell me about it.<br> I'm phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese.<br> Cheese, you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh, Don? - Excuse me? - Cheese.<br> It's smelly.<br> You must smell a lot of the time too.<br> Not really.<br> But with cheese, I think the smellier, the better.<br> Me too! Chandler hates it.<br> I can't have blue cheese in the house.<br> And you're still married to him? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese.<br> Not even bread.<br> Just cheese.<br> No, I want the bread.<br> And pastries.<br> And pate.<br> I'm really not high.<br> I just used to be fat.<br> I have a villa in the Loire Valley you can stay in.<br> Is it made of cheese? No.<br> A house made of cheese, wouldn't that be great? - I'd move in tomorrow! - Oh, come on! - Listen to this! - I'm so sorry.<br> - What do we do? - They both want a house of cheese.<br> I don't know how you fight that.<br> Okay, okay.<br> I can do this.<br> I can tell her how I feel.<br> Okay, stand up straight.<br> Take a couple deep breaths.<br> Look confident.<br> Joey? What's up? I came by because I want to talk to you about something.<br> What's up? Here, in the hall? What are we, animals? I'm late for a meeting.<br> Could you make it quick? I just came by to tell you that I want to have dinner with you.<br> Sure.<br> Just tell me where to meet you.<br> Okay.<br> That's good.<br> That gives you a couple of hours to prepare.<br> Don't you people ever knock? I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.<br> Sure.<br> Set it up.<br> I'll just be browsing through the personals.<br> Are you okay? You're acting weird.<br> Yeah.<br> Fine.<br> Not perfect.<br> But good enough.<br> Jeez, what's with you? I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"? - What's going on? - Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.<br> I don't believe in that, but you two get along.<br> I'll step aside if you wanna go with Don and live in a house of cheese.<br> - You don't believe in soul mates? - No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.<br> I don't believe in soul mates, either.<br> - You don't? - Nope.<br> We weren't destined to end up together.<br> We fell in love and work hard at our relationship.<br> Some days we work really hard.<br> So you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house? No, I've had second thoughts.<br> Do you know how hard it'd be to clean? - I love you.<br> - I know.<br> I'm gonna take you out to dinner.<br> I found this place that makes the greatest jalapeno poppers.<br> No? They taste so good.<br> It happens whenever Chandler touches my stomach.<br> I'm worried the baby won't like him.<br> - Are you okay? - Yeah, sure.<br> Look, the reason Is it hot in here? Why don't you take off your sweater? This is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbes.<br> Oh, my God, really? Can I see it? Yeah, sure.<br> I wouldn't think Hobbes would like that so much.<br> How long have we known each other? Seven, eight Eight years.<br> Wow.<br> A long time.<br> But over the past few weeks, l Okay! Sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here.<br> Our specials tonight - Could you give us a second? - Sure.<br> Second's up! Not that kind of table.<br> So you were saying? I'm not sure.<br> You asked how long we knew each other, and I said eight years.<br> Then the waiter came over and cut his tip in half and now here we are.<br> Yeah.<br> Here we are.<br> I think I'm falling in love with you.<br> What? I'm falling in love with you.<br> Who are you talking to? Oh, you're kidding.<br> It's a joke.<br> Funny.<br> It's funny! I don't get it.<br> Okay.<br> Wow.<br> Are you? How did? When? Does it really matter? Wow.<br> Wow.<br> It is hot in here.<br> I know this is a lot.<br> You don't have to say anything.<br> You take as much time as you need.<br> Okay, you gotta say something.<br> Joey, I love you so much.<br> - But - But.<br> Joey? Right.<br> Hey, that's That's okay.<br> That's fine.<br> It's pretty much what I was expecting.<br> It's no big deal, all right? - I think I'm gonna go.<br> - Please don't leave like this.<br> You can't do this to a pregnant woman! Don't start doing that.<br> You can't do that, because you're gonna make me Oh, there we go! - Can I? - Sure.<br> Oh, Joey.<br> I don't want to lose Hey, hey.<br> You can't, okay? Ever.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Please don't be sorry.<br> Okay? Don't be sorry.<br> You know, I was only kidding.<br> Yeah, that was a real good one.<br> - Is this your table? - Yeah.<br> - You'll be here all night.<br> - I know.<br> I haven't even read the specials.<br> What's the matter? I don't know.<br> I think maybe one of them is dying.<br> I kind of hope it's the girl.<br> The guy is really cute!   <br>
