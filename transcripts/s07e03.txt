                    			Hey, guys.<br> So, what do you think? -About what? -What? Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint.<br> Eyes.<br> No, no.<br> Your eyes! No.<br> Chandler's eyes! I got glasses.<br> You always had glasses.<br> No, I didn't.<br> Are you sure? Didn't you have a pair? They were really round and burgundy, and they made you look kind of.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -Feminine.<br> -Yes! No.<br> I think the glasses look great.<br> You look sexy.<br> -Really? -Yeah.<br> You didn't think I wore glasses? Of course.<br> The One With Phoebe's Cookies Gelula/SDI What do you want for an engagement gift? That's okay, we're not having a party.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so you don't have to get us-- If someone wants to give us a present, we can't deprive them of that joy.<br> You should get them a little CD player.<br> I already have one.<br> Unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.<br> Yeah, and by "someone" she means Joey.<br> I know what I want! -What we want, honey.<br> -No, you don't want this.<br> I want your grandmother's cookie recipe.<br> You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe? The one my grandma made me swear on her deathbed.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I would never let out of our family? Dying people say the craziest things.<br> I've wanted it for years.<br> I was gonna make cookies for my children.<br> Break my heart.<br> Oh, all right.<br> I'll be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.<br> Our kids are gonna be fat, aren't they? Ahoy! -How's the boat? -I'm getting into this sailing stuff.<br> You finally took it out of the marina? Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there.<br> If you don't sail it, what do you do on it? It's a great place to just sit.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.<br> It's good that you finally have a place to do that.<br> I could teach you to sail if you want.<br> -You could? -I've been sailing my whole life.<br> When I was 1 5, my dad bought me my own boat.<br> -Your own boat? -He was trying to cheer me up.<br> My pony was sick.<br> -You know what I was thinking? -What? Nothing, I just like to go like this.<br> -What are you doing tonight? -Do you have a lecture? -No, why? -Then, free as a bird.<br> What's up? My dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball.<br> Great! Dad must like you! He doesn't ask just anyone to play.<br> He didn't ask for you.<br> He asked for "Chauncey.<br> " I assumed he meant you.<br> Did you correct him? No, I thought it would be more fun this way.<br> Cool! Maybe you could do this every week.<br> Or you could sit on the porch.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and make sure no one steals the trashcans.<br> He does that every week too.<br> Just so you know, you have to let him win.<br> He hates to lose.<br> Maybe I'll play with my left hand.<br> You're not a lefty? Does anybody know me? What's wrong? I went to my old apartment to get the cookie recipe.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and that stupid fire burned it up! No! Why didn't you make a copy and keep it in a fireproof box.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and keep it at least 1 00 yards away from the original? Because I'm normal.<br> That was the one legacy my grandmother left me.<br> And I know you wanted it as an engagement present.<br> We have to get you an engagement present? Don't worry about it.<br> No one got me an engagement present.<br> I don't have the recipe, but here.<br> I wish you health and happiness.<br> An old cookie? This is what happens when you don't register for gifts.<br> I made a batch and froze it.<br> This is the only one left.<br> We can't accept this.<br> Why not? Cause it's gross.<br> No, wait.<br> I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie.<br> I do this at work all the time.<br> -Really? -I think so! Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.<br> Two! I've been engaged twice.<br> Look at this clown.<br> He thinks he can take up the whole river.<br> Get out of the way, jackass! Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway? That is the Coast Guard.<br> What are they doing here? The coast is all the way over there.<br> Joey, just ignore the boats.<br> -We're not finished with our lesson.<br> -All right.<br> I'm gonna go over the basic points once more.<br> Come on, Rach.<br> I got it, okay? I want to go over there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>where that boatload of girls is.<br> Is that it? You want to give.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>a shout to the hot chicas? Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.<br> Quick question, though: What's this called? -Boat rope? -Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up? Rub it? No.<br> What do you do if I say we're coming about? I say, "Come again?" I know this one.<br> I know this one.<br> Time's up.<br> Now you're dead.<br> And deaf! You go on and make your little jokes.<br> If you don't know what you're doing.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you will die.<br> Am I getting through to you? -Yes.<br> -Don't just say yes.<br> This isn't a game.<br> You could get hurt out here! Do you want to pay attention, or do you want to die? I want to make a ship-to-shore call to Chandler.<br> -I definitely taste nutmeg.<br> -You do? You don't? Well, that's the difference.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>between a professional and a layman.<br> That and arrogance.<br> Hey.<br> Hey.<br> How was sailing? I don't want to talk about it.<br> You could've at least saved me a cookie.<br> Women are mean! I can't believe that.<br> Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>this crumb.<br> I wish you a long and happy marriage.<br> -Hey.<br> -How was it? Well, I had a great time.<br> Chauncey on the other hand.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I will tell the story.<br> It was going great.<br> I let him win, we were bonding.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he even said I could call him Dad.<br> And what did he ask you not to call him? "Daddy.<br> " Look, here's the story.<br> We hadjust finished playing, and we were gonna take a steam.<br> I walk into the room and it's really steamy.<br> So I take off my glasses, and that's when it happened.<br> Guys? -Over here.<br> -Have a seat, son.<br> Hey! -Oh, my God! I can't believe it.<br> -I know.<br> You gave my father a lap dance.<br> Why do they put so much steam in there? Because otherwise they'd have to call it the "room" room.<br> Why? Why did that have to happen? Come on, it's not that big a deal.<br> Not that big a deal? There was touching of things.<br> I know you wanted to bond with my dad.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but did you have to bond to that part? I'm sure Dad doesn't care.<br> He probably thought it was funny.<br> He'll be telling this story for years.<br> I don't want him to tell this story for years.<br> Oh, but he will.<br> He still tells the story about how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.<br> I wasn't escaping.<br> Then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire? I was trying to help out a squirrel.<br> You were trying to eat it.<br> If that is your father calling to tell this story.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then the marriage is off! Come on.<br> Hello.<br> I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.<br> I'll call you later, Dad.<br> I love you.<br> I'm off to see your dad.<br> Aren't you a little overdressed? You better make sure he tips you this time.<br> I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I figured the best way to do that was face to face.<br> And by "face," I don't mean his lap.<br> And by "face," I don't mean my ass.<br> Are you getting Monica and Chandler a present? I don't know.<br> You know, they didn't get us anything.<br> Thank you! Hey.<br> Well, hello.<br> So when are we getting back out on the water, matey? I don't know the boat way to say this, but, never.<br> Why not? Because you're mean on the boat.<br> I was just trying to teach you.<br> Well, lesson learned.<br> Rachel is mean.<br> Yep, yep, yep.<br> I remember when she took me out on her dad's boat.<br> She wouldn't let me help at all.<br> Excuse me, I wanted you to help.<br> But you couldn't move.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because you were wearing three life jackets.<br> You have to respect the sea.<br> Joey, I'm sorry if you thought that was mean.<br> But I tell you, that was not mean.<br> My father is mean.<br> He used to always yell at me on the boat.<br> It was horrible.<br> I was being a really good teacher.<br> Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer, pinhead! " Does a good student drink 7 beers during his first lesson? Six and a half.<br> You knocked the last one out of my hand, remember? I didn't want you to get hit by the boom.<br> Well, it hit me anyway.<br> It would have hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I will try to tone it down and stop yelling.<br> No bossing me around? -I won't boss you around.<br> -And be nice? -I'll be nice.<br> -You'll be topless? -Joey! -You want me to learn? Here's batch 22.<br> Maybe these are like your grandma's.<br> This has a bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.<br> Let's give it a shot.<br> I haven't made so many cookies since 9th grade.<br> What for, a bake sale? No, just a Friday night.<br> These are pretty good.<br> Yeah, but not as good as batch 1 7.<br> Which one was that? The ones we had after you almost threw up.<br> Oh, yeah, batch 1 7 was good.<br> I did not like batch 1 6.<br> I'm okay.<br> Any more from the good batch? We could work off those.<br> I think there's one left.<br> Batch 1 6.<br> Sixteen, people, get out of the way! Okay, Joey.<br> You're doing really good.<br> I just need you to step to the portside.<br> Remember talking about the portside? Oh, yeah.<br> No.<br> It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.<br> That's a tough one.<br> Why not just say left? Okay, go to the left.<br> The left.<br> Just sit over there! You're yelling again.<br> See that? Oh, no, no.<br> Very quiet.<br> Said with love, no yelling.<br> You know what? Since I'm here, I'm gonna have a beer on the portside.<br> See what I did there? We're luffing a little.<br> Can you tighten up the Cunningham? You just said a bunch of stuff I don't know.<br> Joey, come on! We just went over this.<br> We did that when that bird.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>flew over with the fish in his mouth.<br> Did you see it? It was gross.<br> I did not see the bird or the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat.<br> Which obviously is an impossible thing to do.<br> You're yelling, and I don't see you taking your top off.<br> I quit! -What do you mean? You can't quit.<br> -Why not? You're not finished! I won't have it.<br> Greenes do not quit.<br> Greenes? I'm a Tribbiani.<br> Tribbianis quit.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I just said, "Greenes don't quit," didn't l? Did I say, "Greenes don't quit"? Yes! And you're still yelling at me.<br> No, I'm not yelling at you.<br> I'm just yelling near you.<br> Oh, God, Joey.<br> I'm my father.<br> Oh, my God.<br> This is horrible.<br> I try so hard not to be my mother, I didn't see this coming.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I just wanted you to learn.<br> I did learn.<br> -Really? -Yeah, come on.<br> It's okay.<br> I know what a mainsail is.<br> I know to duck when the boom comes across.<br> -I know port is right.<br> -Left.<br> Damn it! It would make my grandmother happy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that we're trying to figure out her recipe.<br> I bet she's looking up at us and smiling right now.<br> Looking up? She was really nice to me but she's in hell for sure.<br> Well, I've tried everything.<br> I give up.<br> I'm not gonna be the mom.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who makes the world's best cookies.<br> I do make the best duck confit with broccoli raab.<br> Kids love that, right? Isn't there any relative that has the recipe? What about your sister? No.<br> I made a promise to myself that the next time.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I would talk to Ursula is over my dead body.<br> And that's not happening till October 1 5, 2032.<br> That's the day you're gonna die? I've got shuffleboard that day.<br> That's what you think.<br> What about friends of your grandma? Wouldn't they have the recipe? I may have relatives in France who would know.<br> My grandmother said she got it from her grandmother, "Nestley Toulouse.<br> " What was her name? Nestley Toulouse.<br> NestlÃ© Tollhouse? You Americans always butcher the French language.<br> Phoebe, is this the recipe? Yes! Oh.<br> I cannot believe that I spent.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>two days figuring out that recipe.<br> It was here the whole time! I know! You see, it is stuff like this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>which is why you're burning in hell! So you understand.<br> I'd feel better if you didn't tell what happened.<br> I'm a little embarrassed about it.<br> I understand completely.<br> Nothing's scarier than embarrassing yourself.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in front of your in-laws.<br> As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy, I was unemployed.<br> Her father asked me what I did for a living.<br> I said I was a lawyer.<br> -What'd you do when they found out? -They never did.<br> So if you ever see me giving them legal advice, just nod along.<br> Shall we? So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.<br> Well, Joey, I hate to admit it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>your way of sailing is a lot more fun.<br> Why don't you give a pull on that rope? We're not sailing.<br> -Just pull on it.<br> -All right.<br> Sandwiches! What else? Here you go.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Oh, wow.<br> -What are you doing? -Sorry.<br> Not like that.<br> You're letting all the good stuff fall out.<br> Careful! You're wasting good pastrami! Oh, my God.<br> I'm my dad!   <br>
