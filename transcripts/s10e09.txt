                    			- Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> We're here to say goodbye.<br> We're off to Ohio.<br> Oh, right, your adoption interview.<br> Yep.<br> We'll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.<br> I can't believe it.<br> When you come back, you'll have a baby.<br> That is so weird.<br> And so incorrect.<br> She's only a few months pregnant.<br> She liked our application but might not like us.<br> Come on, she's gonna love you guys.<br> Thank you.<br> But we're trying not to get our hopes up.<br> A lot could still get in our way.<br> She could decide against adoption, like another couple better.<br> What are you gonna name it? I could develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.<br> But just think, okay? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys? Oh, my God.<br> She's gonna pick us! So we're standing firm on "not getting our hopes up"? No.<br> I know things could still go wrong, but if they don't if this works out, we're gonna have a baby.<br> A baby! - Yes.<br> But - Oh, my God.<br> It's gonna work! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mommy, and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers.<br> I'm gonna go get me a baby! Screw it.<br> I'm gonna be a daddy! The One With the Birth Mother Hey, who's Phoebe with? I wanna say, "Someone I'm gonna have sex with.<br>" - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> - So who's your friend? - Oh, that's Sarah.<br> No.<br> Don't you get any ideas.<br> I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends.<br> - Why? Why? - Because you'll date her once sleep with her, then forget she exists.<br> Name one friend of yours I did that with.<br> - Mandy.<br> - Mandy, huh? Really hot blond, big boobs? - No.<br> - Might be why I don't remember, huh? Do you think I'm someone else? Look, I may not have treated your friends well in the past.<br> But I have grown up a lot.<br> Really.<br> Honest.<br> Rach? Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.<br> I mean, when Joey and I were together he was wonderful.<br> He was thoughtful and mature.<br> And for the one week that we went out he didn't sleep with anybody else.<br> Growth.<br> - Fine, I'll give you her number.<br> - Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> And I promise you I will not forget this one.<br> - Mandy.<br> - Sarah! Sarah.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.<br> How does this look? Well, it's It's a little low.<br> Pick it up a little.<br> A little bit more.<br> A little bit more.<br> There you go.<br> Now throw it away.<br> Come on! This looks good.<br> Ross, please trust me.<br> I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.<br> Now I don't know who's running for president or who that NATO guy is but I do know that you have to get far away from that hat.<br> Damn it.<br> God I have this date tomorrow night, and I have to look cool.<br> If you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow.<br> - You're welcome to come with us.<br> - Really? That would be great.<br> I mean, I have to do something.<br> She kind of teased me about how I dress.<br> I can see why.<br> Nice shirt.<br> You're wearing the same shirt.<br> Stupid Gap on every corner! Make yourselves comfortable, and I'll be back with Erica.<br> Okay, thank you.<br> Well, this is it.<br> - Are you okay? - Yeah, it's just weird, you know? It's like, "Hi, I'm Chandler.<br> May I have the human growing inside you?" You're gonna be great.<br> You're gonna be great.<br> Well, obviously.<br> Monica? Chandler? I'd like you to meet Erica.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> It is so, so nice to meet you.<br> - Hi.<br> - Thank you for agreeing to see us.<br> - Hi.<br> - I'll let you get acquainted.<br> - Okay.<br> - So it's Monica and Chandler? I only know you as "File CRW33815-D.<br>" That's what our friends call us.<br> Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple.<br> It's kind of intimidating.<br> I don't know about that.<br> Are you kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.<br> But on top of it, you're married to a reverend? - I don't think that's exactly - Let her finish, doctor.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> My friend Sarah had a great time last night.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah, so you gonna call this one back? No.<br> What are you talking about? Sarah's great.<br> Oh, really? You want to know what your "great" friend did? We're out to dinner, okay? We were getting along, having a really nice time.<br> I was thinking she was really cool.<br> And then, out of nowhere That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So she took some fries.<br> Big deal.<br> Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.<br> It's about what the fries represent.<br> - What? - All food! Well, I'm sorry.<br> I can't believe I set you up with such a monster! Hey, look, I take a girl out she can order whatever she wants.<br> The more the better, all right? Just don't order a garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers.<br> - Thank God you're here.<br> Listen to this.<br> - What? Joey and my friend are out last night, having dinner, and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries - Oh, no! What? You know about the plate thing? Oh, yeah, yeah.<br> No, Joey doesn't share food.<br> I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple grapes on his plate.<br> - You wouldn't let her have a grape? - No, not me.<br> Emma.<br> Joey doesn't share food! Well, I still think that is a stupid reason not to call someone again.<br> You are calling her, okay? And if you need to, then just get an extra plate of fries for the table.<br> I like that.<br> A sharing buffer.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.<br> Maybe a plate of onion rings.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> And a shrimp cocktail.<br> And some Buffalo wings.<br> Maybe Maybe an individual pizza, huh? And some mozzarella sticks.<br> What were we talking about? Wow, this place is awesome.<br> We should just go.<br> I'm not gonna find anything here.<br> This stuff is ridiculous.<br> Oh, this place is great! Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this.<br> Nothing silver.<br> - Why? - Okay, nothing with hair.<br> And nothing with padlocks on it! Ross, look.<br> Look, I know that some of this stuff is out there.<br> But I mean, come on, look at this.<br> Look at this sweater.<br> I mean, this is just beautiful.<br> Wow, this is really soft.<br> Three hundred and fifty dollars? Down from 700.<br> You're saving, like, 200 bucks.<br> Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.<br> Hey, check this out.<br> It's totally you.<br> - Wow.<br> - Yeah.<br> Wow.<br> Actually, this looks pretty good.<br> Yeah.<br> "Boys will be boys"? - What? They will be! - All right.<br> - That's it, I'm getting out of here.<br> - No, Ross, wait, come on.<br> There's other stuff here.<br> There's some nice shirts, these nice pants.<br> Actually, these might look pretty good on me.<br> Yes, they will.<br> You know what you should do? Go take a walk.<br> All right? I know your size, and I'll pick out some really good stuff for you.<br> - Really? - Yes.<br> I know what looks sexy on guys.<br> Just wear what I suggest, and she is gonna go nuts for you.<br> So you're saying if I wear these pants, I might be getting into hers? Why do men keep talking to me like this? So the fact that I'm a doctor and my wife's a reverend that's important to you? Yeah.<br> I read some great applications but I thought, "Who better than a minister to raise a child?" Amen.<br> Plus, I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor.<br> Good hands.<br> Healing hands.<br> Reverend, can I ask? Does the Bible say anything about adoption? It says, "Do it.<br>" "And behold, she did adopt unto them a baby.<br> And it was good.<br>" - Wow.<br> - Yeah, wow.<br> I was wondering You both have such serious jobs.<br> Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.<br> Yeah.<br> My flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point.<br> Good flock.<br> Flock, flock, flock.<br> But being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time.<br> Not for me it doesn't.<br> So how's everything going in here? We're great.<br> I think I may have asked all my questions.<br> Good.<br> Do you have questions for Erica? Yeah, actually.<br> So you read a file that you liked and then you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? Yes.<br> Our system ensures total anonymity.<br> - We're very proud of it.<br> - You should be.<br> You're really on top of stuff.<br> Well then, if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.<br> I actually - I don't think we have to.<br> - We don't? Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you but I just thought we should meet face to face.<br> I've made my decision.<br> I choose them.<br> God, this is great.<br> This is so great.<br> Did you hear that? Yeah, I did.<br> Hey.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you so much.<br> You are so going to heaven! - We got some really great stuff.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yeah, but I'm not sure about some of the bras I got.<br> Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me? Okay.<br> Wait, are we in Joey's imagination? Oh, no.<br> I took one of Ross' bags by mistake.<br> And one of mine is missing.<br> Ross probably has it.<br> You'll get it from him later.<br> So, what do you think? I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.<br> She told me to trust her, and you know what? I'm glad I did.<br> I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.<br> Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.<br> I see.<br> Somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies? Looks like someone is the ladies! You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.<br> Yeah.<br> Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date.<br> See? All eyes on me! - We are not signing those papers.<br> - Why not? It's wrong.<br> They made a mistake.<br> They think we're somebody else.<br> God works in mysterious ways.<br> You have got to stop.<br> But she liked us.<br> She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.<br> If you think about it, I'm kind of like a reverend.<br> I mean, as a chef, I serve God by feeding the hungry and poor.<br> Your veal chop is 34.<br>95! Come on, I just I think we've been given an opportunity.<br> The mistake's already made.<br> They're writing up the papers now.<br> But we're not the ones she chose.<br> How can you feel okay about this? Because.<br> We may not be who she thinks we are but no one will ever love that baby more than us.<br> - I know.<br> - I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if no one ever picks us? Oh, honey Please? Please.<br> We are so close.<br> Monica, I want a baby too.<br> But this woman is giving away her child.<br> She deserves to know who it's going to.<br> Okay.<br> You're right.<br> So we'll tell the truth.<br> And who knows, you know? Maybe she'll like us for us.<br> Maybe she will.<br> Why couldn't I have been a reverend? You're Jewish.<br> Technicality! Garden salad for the lady.<br> Oh, that looks great.<br> Good ordering.<br> Seafood platter for the gentleman, and extra fries.<br> Enjoy.<br> Those fries look delicious.<br> I didn't know you liked French fries.<br> Help yourself.<br> What's mine is yours.<br> Wow, are those stuffed clams? Yes, they are my stuffed clams.<br> How about those fries, though, huh? - They are delicious.<br> - Yeah.<br> You are beautiful, you know that? That is so sweet.<br> Okay, then.<br> Now look what you did! What? What is the matter with you? I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay? But you said, "What's mine is yours.<br>" Well, I didn't mean it! Fine.<br> Sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.<br> No, I'm sorry.<br> I I'm overreacting, okay? It's just, when it comes to food, I have certain rules okay? I mean there are things you do, and, you know, things that you don't do.<br> Wow, this place looks great.<br> Oh, you are gonna love it.<br> And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.<br> - Me too.<br> - Here.<br> So this was fun.<br> I really am sorry about, you know, before.<br> And I want to make sure you know I really do like you.<br> Sure, just not as much as clams.<br> Well, stuffed clams Chocolate torte for the lady.<br> Cheesecake for the gentleman.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> There seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.<br> Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.<br> I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.<br> Oh, my God.<br> - I'll just have what she's having.<br> - I'm sorry, sir.<br> That was our last piece.<br> Oh, no.<br> This is work.<br> I should call in.<br> Can you excuse me? Yeah, sure.<br> No problem.<br> What are you doing? I thought you don't share food? Sure I do.<br> Coulis? No.<br> If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert.<br> This is a two-way street.<br> Really? Really.<br> Now this all better be here when I come back.<br> Yeah, of course.<br> I can control myself.<br> Stop staring at me! Just a tiny little I'm not even sorry.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> So these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption.<br> There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain as we go through.<br> - Is that a picture? - Yeah.<br> It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week.<br> I thought you might want to see it.<br> Look, doctor.<br> Look, before we sign anything, we really have to talk.<br> We're not who you think we are.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - The agency must have made a mistake.<br> My wife is not a reverend, and I'm not a doctor.<br> - What? - That's impossible.<br> I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.<br> I have to check your file.<br> Excuse me.<br> So who are you? Our names really are Monica and Chandler.<br> We're from New York.<br> Yeah, but the important thing to know about us is how much we would care for this little baby.<br> So you lied to me before? Well, we "bore false witness.<br>" See? I could be a reverend.<br> I can't believe this.<br> But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider - Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this? You don't have to decide now.<br> If you look at our file I don't want to look at your file.<br> This is over.<br> Erica, wait.<br> I have nothing to say to you.<br> Look, you have every reason to be upset.<br> We did lie.<br> But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long.<br> And we don't know how long it's gonna be before we get another chance.<br> Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? Erica, please.<br> Just consider us.<br> Ask them to see our file.<br> Our last name's Bing.<br> My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I actually liked you guys.<br> But it doesn't matter.<br> What you did was wrong.<br> But you did like us.<br> And you should.<br> My wife's an incredible woman.<br> She is loving, and devoted and caring.<br> And don't tell her I said this, but the woman's always right.<br> I love my wife more than anything in this world.<br> And it It kills me that I can't give her a baby.<br> I really want a kid.<br> And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad.<br> But my wife she's already there.<br> She's a mother without a baby.<br> Please? You still want that baby? God bless you, Chandler Bing! Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.<br> So why are you still wearing it? Because it's soft.<br> Hey, so how was your date? Not so good.<br> Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh, buddy? Yeah.<br> And you know what? We could do a lot worse.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Yeah.<br> Joey doesn't share food!   <br>
