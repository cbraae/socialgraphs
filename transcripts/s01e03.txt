                    			- Hi, guys.<br> - Hey, Phoebe.<br> - How did it go? - Not so good.<br> He walked me home and said, "Let's do this again.<br>" He said, "Let's do this again.<br>" That's good, right? Translated, "Let's do this again" means, "You'll never see me naked.<br>" Since when? Since always.<br> It's, like, dating language.<br> Like, "It's not you" means, "It is you.<br>" "You're nice" means, "I'll be dating alcoholics.<br>.<br> and complaining about them to you.<br>" "We should see other people" means: "Ha-ha, I already am!" Everybody knows this? Cushions the blow.<br> Like your parents putting the dog to sleep.<br>.<br> and saying it went to a farm.<br> That's funny.<br> Because our parents actually did.<br>.<br> send our dog off to live on a farm.<br> Ross? Hello! The Milner's farm in Connecticut? The Milners had this unbelievable farm.<br> They had horses and rabbits to chase.<br> And it was.<br>.<br> Oh, my God! Chi-Chi! The One With the Thumb How does it feel knowing you're about to die? Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.<br> But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.<br> That was really good! Thanks.<br> Let's keep going.<br> So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh? I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke.<br> Smoke away! I think this is why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.<br> - What? - Relax your hand.<br> Let your wrist go.<br> Not so much! All right.<br> Now take a puff.<br> Right.<br> - Give it to me.<br> - I'm not giving you a cigarette.<br> It's fine.<br> Do you want to get this part or not? Here.<br> When you hold it, you feel right.<br> You feel complete.<br> - You miss it? - No, not so much.<br> All right.<br> Now we smoke.<br> Oh, my God! - Give me that! - No.<br> You've got options.<br> You can smoke like this: - Chandler - Or hold it in your mouth.<br> Give me the cigarette! - You try.<br> - Thank you.<br> Okay, how's this? Okay, that's not bad.<br> All right, when you're finished, it's cool if you flick it.<br> All right, you keep practicing.<br>.<br> and I'll go put out the sofa.<br> I thought it was foot size.<br> No.<br> It's the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb.<br>.<br> to the tip of his index finger.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> Can I use either thumb? I'd rather go with the foot theory.<br> All right.<br> Don't tell me.<br> Decaf cappuccino for Joey.<br> Coffee, black.<br> Latte.<br> And an iced tea.<br> - I'm getting good at this.<br> - Excellent! Good for me! - You okay, Phoebe? - It's not worth It's my bank.<br> - What did they do? - It's nothing I get my mail and open their monthly "statement.<br>" Easy! And there's $500 extra in my account.<br> Satan's minions at work again! Now I have to go deal with them - What are you talking about? Keep it! - It's not mine.<br> If I kept it, I'd be stealing.<br> But if you spent it, it would be like shopping.<br> Say I bought a great pair of shoes.<br> Know what I'd hear with every step? "Not mine.<br> Not mine.<br> Not mine.<br>" Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear: "Not-not mine.<br> Not-not mine.<br>" We're with you.<br> We got it.<br> I'd never be able to enjoy it.<br> It'd be this giant karmic debt.<br> Chandler, what are you doing? What are you doing? Oh, gross! - What is this? - I'm smoking! You've been so good for three years! And this is my reward.<br> Think about what you went through when you quit.<br> Forget about you.<br> Think about what we went through! So this time I won't quit.<br> - Put it out! - I'm putting it out! Oh, no! I can't drink this now.<br> I'm gonna go.<br> I've got a date.<br> With Alan again? How's it going? It's going pretty good.<br> It's nice and we're having fun.<br> When do we get to meet him? Let's see, it's Monday.<br>.<br> - Never.<br> - Come on! Not after what happened with Steve.<br> What do you mean? We love Steve.<br> Steve was sexy! Sorry.<br> I don't know how I feel yet.<br> Let me figure it out.<br> Then can we meet him? No.<br> Sorry.<br> Joey.<br> Let it go.<br> Why should they meet him? I bring a guy home and they're like.<br>.<br> coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.<br> Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef.<br>.<br> I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.<br> Your friends are just looking after you.<br> I wish that once I'd date a guy they liked.<br> You realize the odds of that happening are slimmer.<br>.<br> - if they never get to meet the guy.<br> - I know.<br> - Can't I whimper a little bit? - Whimper.<br> Okay, I'm done.<br> Let it go, Ross.<br> You didn't know Chi-Chi.<br> - Do you all promise? - We promise.<br> We'll be good.<br> Chandler, do you promise to be good? You can come in, but your filter-tip buddy stays outside! "Dear Ms.<br> Buffay.<br> Thank you for calling.<br> We've credited you $500.<br> We're sorry for the inconvenience.<br>.<br> and hope you'll accept this football phone.<br>.<br> as our gift.<br>" Do you believe it? Now I have $ 1000 and a football phone.<br> What bank is this? Okay, it's him.<br> - Who is it? - Alan.<br> Chandler! He's here! Do I look okay? One more button.<br> Closed! How about closed? - I didn't know.<br> - Yeah.<br> Please be good.<br> Remember how much you all like me? Alan, this is everybody.<br> Everybody, this is Alan.<br> I've heard so much about all you guys.<br> I'll call you tomorrow.<br> Thanks.<br> Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.<br> Who's gonna take the first shot? Come on! I'll go.<br> Let's start with how he kept picking I'm sorry, I can't do this.<br> We loved him.<br> We loved him! Wait! We're talking about someone I'm going out with? That pimento trick! I'll never look at an olive the same way again.<br> And did you notice? Know what was great? His smile was crooked.<br> - Yes! Like the man in the shoe! - What shoe? From the rhyme.<br> There was a man With a crooked smile Who lived in a shoe For a while So I think Alan.<br>.<br> is the yardstick by which future boyfriends will be measured.<br> Future boyfriends? - I think this could be "it.<br>" - Really? I'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.<br> You know I'll be doing that at parties.<br> - Know what I like most? - What? The way he makes me feel about myself.<br> How was the game? Well.<br>.<br> We won! Fantastic! Question.<br> How is that possible? - Alan.<br> - He was unbelievable! Like the cartoon where Bugs Bunny plays every position.<br> It was first base, Alan.<br> Second base, Alan.<br>.<br> It was like he made us into a team.<br> We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball.<br> Can I ask a question? Do you think Alan is sometimes.<br>.<br> What? I don't know.<br> A little too "Alan"? Oh, no.<br> Not possible.<br> You can never be too "Alan.<br>" It's his innate "Alan-ness" that we adore.<br> I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.<br> - Hey, Lizzy.<br> - Hey, weird girl.<br> - I brought alphabet soup.<br> - Pick out the vowels? I left in the Y's.<br> Because, "sometimes Y.<br>" - And something else.<br> - Saltines? No, $1000 and a football phone.<br> What? Oh, my God! - There's really money in here.<br> - I know.<br> What are you doing? I want you to have it.<br> I don't want it.<br> - I have to give you something.<br> - No, you don't - Do you want my tinfoil hat? - No, you need that.<br> - It's okay.<br> Thanks.<br> - Let me do something.<br> I'll tell you what.<br> Buy me a soda and we're even.<br> Okay? - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> Keep the change.<br> Thanks, Lizzy.<br> Want a pretzel? - No, I'm fine.<br> Thanks.<br> - See you.<br> A thumb? I know.<br> There it was, just floating.<br>.<br> like this tiny little hitchhiker.<br> Maybe it's a contest.<br> Like "collect all five.<br>" - Does anyone wanna see? - No, thanks! Don't do that.<br> Come on! It's worse than the thumb.<br> - This is so unfair.<br> - Why is it unfair? So I have a flaw! Big deal! Joey's knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? Ross, over-pronouncing every word.<br> Monica, who snorts when she laughs.<br> I mean, what the hell is that thing? I accept those flaws.<br> Why can't you accept me for this? Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him? I could live without it.<br> Is it a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? Don't listen to him.<br> I think it's endearing.<br> Oh, you do, do you? There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.<br> Indeed there isn't.<br> I should get back to work.<br> Otherwise someone might get what they ordered.<br> The hair comes out and the gloves come off.<br> Ever go out with a guy your friends really like? No.<br> I'm going out with a guy my friends really like.<br> Are we talking about the coyotes here? All right! A cow got through.<br> Can you believe it? It's just, you know what? I just don't feel the "thing.<br>" They feel the thing.<br> I don't feel it.<br> Honey, you should always feel the thing.<br> If that's how you feel about the guy, dump him.<br> - It's gonna be really hard.<br> - He'll get over it.<br> No, he'll be fine.<br> It's the other five I'm worried about.<br> - Don't you respect your body? - Don't you see what you're doing? I've had it with your cancer, emphysema and heart disease.<br> The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.<br> Alan wants to speak to you.<br> Really? He does? Hey, buddy! What's up? She told you about that, huh? Well, yeah.<br> I have one now and then.<br> Well, yeah, now.<br> It's not that Well, that's true.<br> Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.<br> Well, okay.<br> Thanks.<br> God, he's good.<br> - If only he were a woman.<br> - Yeah.<br> Lamb Chop! How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.<br> I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.<br> - Where's Joey? - Joey ate my last stick of gum.<br>.<br> so I killed him.<br> Do you think that was wrong? - I think he's across the hall.<br> - Thanks.<br> There you go.<br> I'm alive with pleasure now.<br> Phoebe, do you want the rest of that Pop-Tart? Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart? Hey, I might.<br> I'm sorry.<br> The soda people gave me $7000 for the thumb.<br> And on my way over here I stepped in gum.<br> What is up with the universe? - What's going on? - It's just nice when we're together.<br> It's nicer when everyone gets to wear underwear.<br> Please, guys, we have to talk.<br> Wait! I'm getting a deja vu.<br> No, I'm not.<br> - We have to talk.<br> - There it is! Okay, it's about Alan.<br> Speaking of which, tell him we're on for the Renaissance Fair.<br> Before you get into that, there's something you should know.<br> There's really no easy way to say this.<br> I've decided to break up with Alan.<br> Is there somebody else? No, it's just.<br>.<br> you know, things change.<br> People change.<br> We didn't change.<br> So that's it? It's over? Just like that? You let your guard down.<br> You start to care about someone, and.<br>.<br> - I can go on pretending - Okay! No.<br> That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan, or to you.<br> Well, who wants fair? I just want things back, you know, the way they were.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> - Oh, she's sorry.<br> I feel better.<br> I can't believe this! With the holidays coming up.<br> I wanted him to meet my family.<br> I'll meet someone.<br> There'll be other Alans.<br> Yeah, right! - Are you guys gonna be okay? - We'll be fine.<br> We're just gonna need a little time.<br> I understand.<br> - Wow.<br> - I'm really sorry.<br> Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.<br> - But I'm a little relieved.<br> - Relieved? Yeah, well, I mean, I had a great time with you.<br> I just can't stand your friends.<br> Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats? That was fun.<br> He could row like a Viking.<br> So how'd it go? You know.<br> Did he mention us? He says he's really gonna miss you guys.<br> - Rough day, huh? - You have no idea.<br> Come here.<br> - That's it.<br> I'm getting cigarettes.<br> - No! I don't care! I'm weak! I've gotta have the smoke! If you never smoke again, I'll give you $7000.<br> Yeah, all right.<br>   <br>
