I'll go get them developed, and you can go home.<br> - What did you take a picture of? - Nothing.<br> It was something.<br> Ross has the cameras.<br> Is he checked out yet? Are you joking? Checkout is not till noon.<br> - And he has a good 11 minutes left.<br> - So? He never checks out a minute before he has to.<br> Once we got a late checkout, he got so excited, it was our best sex ever.<br> Until he screamed out "Radisson" at the end.<br> Okay, I'll get Ross, get the cameras and get them developed.<br> Thirty-two, Joe.<br> You're 32! - Here's your bill.<br> - Thanks.<br> Champagne, strawberries Oh, my God! I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night.<br> Yeah, that's sad.<br> Meshugga Nut? The One With the Red Sweater mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Soaps, shampoos.<br> Are you really taking all this stuff? - Why not? It's built in the price of the room.<br> - Yeah, but you don't need - What is this? - Thread.<br> Score! Where are the disposable cameras? - What disposable cameras? - Last night I asked you to take them.<br> - No, you didn't.<br> - Yes, before we cut the cake, I said Yeah, you asked me for a favor.<br> Then my Uncle Murray gave you a check.<br> Then you said, "Why is it called a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" - Yeah, then you did that.<br> - So you don't have the cameras? - No, sorry.<br> - They're gone? Monica's gonna freak! They're here somewhere.<br> I'll help you look.<br> - Great.<br> - In three minutes.<br> You're gonna open the presents without Chandler? They're calling out to me.<br> This guy even crawled into my lap.<br> He wouldn't mind if I opened one.<br> What do you think it is? A mirror that when you look into it, you see yourself as an old woman.<br> A tiny salt shaker! Oh, my God, for tiny salt! Oh, wow! Okay, that was fun.<br> Okay, I'll wait for Chandler to open up the rest.<br> Although, you know, this is part of a salt-and-pepper set.<br> It's only half a present.<br> What do you think? It's okay to open one more if it's a set.<br> It's probably this one.<br> Or this one! - Got any morning sickness? - The guys don't know, do they? No.<br> Chandler thinks Phoebe's pregnant.<br> Right.<br> Chandler still thinks I'm pregnant.<br> He hasn't asked me how I feel, or offered to carry my bags.<br> I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.<br> After you, of course.<br> You'll only be pregnant a few more hours.<br> I'll tell the father today.<br> Is it that tall guy from the first floor? - No! - What? I think he's cute.<br> - Then you have his baby.<br> - I'm trying.<br> It's so weird.<br> You're gonna tell this guy today, and he has no idea.<br> You'll just knock on his door and change his life forever.<br> You're like Ed McMahon, except without the big check.<br> Or the raw sexual magnetism.<br> - Yeah, I guess it's pretty big news.<br> - Pretty big? It's huge! God, this guy is walking around thinking: "I had sex with Rachel Green.<br> I rock!" Then, bam! He's a father, everything's different.<br> Only if he wants it to be.<br> I won't ask for anything.<br> Okay, now he's walking around thinking: "Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam! - What was that "bam"? - I don't know.<br> He's hit by a bus.<br> Joey, what would you do if someone you slept with told you she was pregnant? Who called here? Did she sound blond? Any accent? I gotta make a call.<br> Should have never walked into that Sunglass Hut! It's not you! You didn't get anyone pregnant.<br> Why would you scare me like that? What the hell's going on? Is somebody pregnant? Oh, yeah! That's me.<br> Oh, my God, Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby? Yes, I am.<br> Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby! - Wait, who's the father? - You don't know him.<br> He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.<br> Who is this guy? Because I'll track him down and kick his ass! - David Linn.<br> - David Linn! - Who's David Linn? - Some annoying guy from my gym.<br> - Chandler? - Did you find the cameras? - No.<br> Did you? - Yes, that's why I'm under the table.<br> I checked in the lost and found.<br> No one's turned them in.<br> Great.<br> Those cameras were the only thing that will cheer Monica up.<br> You just got married.<br> Why is she depressed? I'm not going to ask that question.<br> I can't believe I screwed this up! I'm sorry, man.<br> Here's a thought.<br> This is the same ballroom.<br> There's a band.<br> There'll be dressed-up people.<br> Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away? No, we buy more of these, throw our tuxes on and take a few pictures.<br> We make sure not to get people's faces.<br> Are you serious? I'm thinking about your new bride.<br> Do you really want to let her down? Marriage advice? Really? This looks just like your wedding.<br> - Same flowers? - I don't know.<br> Monica picked them.<br> - The chairs? - Those too.<br> - The place settings? - Her.<br> - What did you do? - I took care of the cameras.<br> Gift shop? - Did you do it yet? - Not yet.<br> Then what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? Is it Gunther? - It's not Gunther! - Thank God.<br> That hair on a baby? The father is not here.<br> I haven't told him, and I don't think I can now.<br> Why not? I was walking and thinking, "I'm gonna tell the father.<br> " And then, bam! Bus? No, you! You freaked me out.<br> You kept saying how huge this is.<br> - But it is huge.<br> - I know.<br> But I was thinking how huge it is for me.<br> I didn't think about the father.<br> You're thinking about it too much.<br> Tell him and get it over with.<br> It's like ripping off this Band-Aid, quick and painless.<br> Oh, mother of! See? - Are we opening presents? - No.<br> I shouldn't be opening these.<br> Joey, I am out of control! You have to do me a favor.<br> No matter what I say, do not let me open another present.<br> Give me one more.<br> Good, you're here.<br> Pheebs? Listen Sit down, I got something I want to say.<br> It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom.<br> I always felt that you and I have a special bond.<br> So, Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Oh, my God! Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.<br> - You can't marry him! - Your day's over, it's my turn.<br> - Why can't she marry me? - I can and I will.<br> She's not pregnant.<br> Rachel's the one who's pregnant.<br> Oh, my God! He'd notice when you didn't have a baby! It's Joey! I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant? Who's the father? We don't know.<br> - I wonder if it's that dude.<br> - There's a dude? Who is it? A month ago this guy spent the night.<br> I didn't see who it was, but Was that story over? The guy left this.<br> Oh, my God! I know who the father is.<br> People have got to finish their stories.<br> - Could you take a picture of us? - Of course.<br> - Would you take one of us? - Yeah, sure.<br> Click.<br> - It didn't click.<br> - I heard it.<br> - There was no flash.<br> - You won't take our picture? Yeah, I'll take your picture.<br> - Your finger was covering the lens.<br> - Who are you, Ansel Adams? Scram! I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before so I asked the father to come here.<br> What? Wait a minute.<br> How do you know who it is? I may play the fool at times but I'm more than a pretty blond with an ass that won't quit.<br> I believe this belongs to the father.<br> Oh, God.<br> He's in there right now? You can turn around, or go in and rip the Band-Aid off.<br> - Let's rip.<br> - Are you sure? - Phoebe! - Sorry.<br> Hey, Rach.<br> Go on-stage.<br> I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.<br> Will the owner of a 1995 LeSabre see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.<br> That's my car! - A '95 LeSabre? - Yes.<br> - A green LeSabre? - Yes! - I'm sorry, I meant blue.<br> - Yes, green-blue.<br> Well, go.<br> Go move it! Ready for the last picture? Get ready to run.<br> Congratulations on your wedding.<br> What's this about? Rachel has something to tell you.<br> And I believe that this is your red sweater.<br> No, this is my red sweater.<br> Oh, no.<br> Could I get anyone a coffee? Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.<br> What's going on? Nothing.<br> Phoebe kind of made a mistake.<br> But you wear that sweater a lot.<br> Is it some kind of dare? I'm actually glad Phoebe called.<br> I was immature, but I've grown up.<br> I think we should get back together.<br> It's not the right time.<br> It is the right time.<br> I'm ready for more.<br> Let's give it another try.<br> I'm having a baby.<br> - You can go.<br> - Thank you.<br> I don't know how any of these got opened! - You opened them all? - I know, I am a terrible person.<br> Chandler won't trust me ever again.<br> - You got my parents' gift.<br> - What is that? I think it does something to salami.<br> - How'd it go? - What did Tag say? Tag is not the father.<br> And Joey knows now? I do, and I'm so happy for you.<br> Wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra.<br> - Will you ever tell whoever it is? - I will, just not tonight.<br> No matter what he says, you're not gonna be alone.<br> I'm not? No.<br> Listen It's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom.<br> I've always felt like you and I have a special bond.<br> - Rachel, will you marry me? - What? - Pheebs, give me the ring back.<br> - No! Joey, you're so sweet, honey, but I'm not looking for a husband.<br> I understand.<br> If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and lie down.<br> I can't say that didn't hurt.<br> - But I'll take you back, Joey.<br> - About that, l - Oh, a Salami Buddy! - There you go! - We're back! - Great.<br> We're hanging in the kitchen.<br> Let's stay in the kitchen.<br> - It's picture time.<br> - You're gonna love these.<br> Here's a picture of Ross.<br> And that's me.<br> And that's me and Ross.<br> And here's our first kiss as a married couple.<br> That is a great picture.<br> And interesting, because I found the cameras in one of our bags.<br> Didn't see that coming.<br> Okay, this isn't our first kiss but it is my first kiss with this lady.<br> Which I'm sure you'll remember, so there's no need - I'll take these to get developed now.<br> - Good idea.<br> You opened the presents? We were gonna do that together.<br> You kissed another woman? - Call it even? - Okay.<br> - I'll put these in water.<br> - You stole those from that wedding? No, the hotel lobby.<br> They think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of nuts! Hey, my sweater! I've been looking for this for a month.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Hey, how you doing? - Good.<br> Long time no see.<br> - Like your sweater.<br> - Right back at you.<br> - It's crazy about Rachel.<br> - Well, she's one crazy lady.<br> - So whose is it? - I don't know, some Italian guy.<br> Come on, read your own label.<br> See you later.<br> He is so weird.<br>   <br>
