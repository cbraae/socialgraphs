This is a police badge! Cool.<br> But why would a cop come in here? They don't serve doughnuts.<br> Could you discover the badge again? I can do better than that.<br> I bet somebody's missing that badge.<br> I should take it back.<br> But at the police station I'll check their 10 Most Wanted List.<br> My friend's been number 11 forever.<br> This could be her year! -Hey, you guys.<br> -Hey, Joey.<br> Is that my sweatshirt? Yes, it is.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I was cold.<br> I hope it's okay.<br> It's just that if you wear someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriend's? And I'm not him.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'll give it back.<br> It's gonna be all smelling like Monica.<br> Do I smell bad? You smell like a meadow.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What's with him? The last time Joey went to a meadow his mother was shot by a hunter.<br> Look what I found.<br> It's a police badge.<br> What's that doing here? I don't see any doughnuts.<br> Cops and doughnuts.<br> Come on.<br> If Chandler had said it you'd all be on the floor.<br> Cops, doughnuts? Me? I still don't know.<br> I want to make sure I bought the right couch, one that says "Kids welcome here," but that also says "Come here to me.<br>" What? You say that to kids? The "Come here to me" is, you know, for the ladies.<br> Ross, honey, it's a nice couch, it's not a magic couch.<br> Well, you picked a great couch.<br> -Sign here, please.<br> -Sure.<br> The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch! That's ridiculous.<br> He lives three blocks away.<br> I'll take it myself.<br> Thank you.<br> All right, Rach, come on.<br> Let's go.<br> Are you kidding? Come on.<br> It's only three blocks.<br> It's not very heavy.<br> Try it.<br> Oh, I can do it.<br> You two will really enjoy that couch.<br> We're not together.<br> Something didn't quite add up there.<br> What's that supposed to mean? Well, you.<br> Her.<br> I mean, she's very you know.<br> And you're, like you know? Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.<br> Really? You two? I don't want to do this now.<br> I'm carrying a heavy couch.<br> Then tell him quickly.<br> Fine.<br> We went out.<br> Not only did we go out we did it 298 times! You kept count? You are such a loser! A loser you did it with 298 times! Excuse me, ma'am.<br> You can't put your cigarette out on a tree.<br> Yeah, I can.<br> It worked well.<br> But you shouldn't.<br> So don't ever do that again.<br> I won't.<br> Till I have my next cigarette.<br> Hold it! N.<br>Y.<br>P.<br>D.<br> Freeze, punk! That's right.<br> You are so busted.<br> Book them.<br> -Who are you talking to? -Save it, red! Apologize to the tree or spend the night in the slammer.<br> I am not apologizing to a tree.<br> You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.<br> Backup! Backup! I'm sorry! Sorry! Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup! Didn't you say there was an elevator in here? Yes, I did, but there isn't.<br> Here we go! Don't you think we should rethink the whole hiring movers thing? No way.<br> They're a rip-off.<br> They check out your stuff and come back later and steal it.<br> It's true.<br> I saw it on Dateline.<br> Jane Pauley is the one woman I would kiss.<br> -There's just something about her.<br> -Rach, can we concentrate? Yeah, fine.<br> I listened to your dumb story.<br> Okay, go left.<br> Left.<br> Left.<br> Okay, you know what? There's no more left left.<br> Lift it straight up over your head.<br> Straight up.<br> You can do it! You can do it! Okay.<br> You got it? -Go, go.<br> -Good, good.<br> You got it, right? You got it, right? You got Any chance you think it looks good there? This guy was all: And I'm all, "Buffay! Homicide!" It was just so cool! -You were supposed to take it back.<br> -I'm having fun doing good deeds.<br> You can get arrested for impersonating a police officer.<br> You could get arrested right now! I'd better take it back.<br> I'm totally drunk with power.<br> Yeah.<br> I didn't know you guys would be here.<br> -Do me a favor.<br> Taste this.<br> -What? Why? It's okay, Joe, she's a trained chef.<br> Actually, I was looking for Phoebe.<br> Well, you just missed her.<br> Was that her? -I gotta go.<br> -Joey, wait a minute.<br> Wait.<br> -What is with you? -Nothing.<br> You're acting strange.<br> All right.<br> There is something.<br> I kind of had a dream.<br> But I don't want to talk about it.<br> What if Martin Luther King had said that? I kind of have a dream.<br> I don't want to talk about it.<br> Look, it involved Monica.<br> You had a dream about the girl I'm seeing? Cool.<br> I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.<br> Let's talk about your dream.<br> I love you.<br> Your dream? There was no sex.<br> I haven't dreamt of her like that since I found out about you two.<br> More or less.<br> What was the dream about? You were my girlfriend.<br> We were doing the crossword puzzle.<br> Like you did last night.<br> That's it.<br> I'm in love with Monica.<br> I'll move out.<br> Joey, come on.<br> That doesn't mean you're in love with me.<br> It doesn't? It could mean anything.<br> Like you're jealous that I've become the apartment stud.<br> Sounds like your dream.<br> Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me being close and stuff and you want that too.<br> In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.<br> If that's what it was, that'd be great.<br> I wouldn't have to move.<br> Are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her? -Not really.<br> -There you have it! Well, sure! I'm just wearing sweats! But that's good! You're not in love with me.<br> You just want a girlfriend.<br> It's not just about getting a girlfriend.<br> I could get a girlfriend.<br> We could sit and do crossword puzzles.<br> But could we have the closeness like you have? Monica and I were friends before we dated.<br> Maybe that's it.<br> Friends first? That's interesting.<br> -You become friends after? -No, never done that either.<br> Do you guys have a tape measure? Yeah.<br> It's actually in my bedroom.<br> That's right.<br> What's up, Joey? How you doing? Excuse me.<br> Is this your car? Don't park here.<br> You're blocking the entrance.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's not a problem.<br> It's a problem for me, so it's a problem for you, because I'm a cop.<br> So am l.<br> Okay.<br> So you're a cop.<br> You can park anywhere.<br> I know, because I'm a cop too.<br> Keep up the good work.<br> 10-4.<br> Wait.<br> So, what precinct are you with? I'm with the 57th.<br> -I know a guy in Homicide up there.<br> -I'm in Vice.<br> In fact, I'm undercover right now.<br> I'm a whore.<br> Who else is in Vice there? Do you know Sipowicz? Sipowicz? I don't think so.<br> Yeah.<br> Sipowicz.<br> Yeah.<br> Big guy, kind of bald.<br> I don't know him.<br> Don't try to call him.<br> He's not there.<br> He's out.<br> His partner just died.<br> Tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.<br> I sure will.<br> Take care.<br> By the way, I'm sure Sipowicz will be all right.<br> I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good.<br> Where'd you find my badge? Could you give me and Ross a hand moving his couch? I'd love to, but I got acting class.<br> But you know what? I guess I could blow that off.<br> For you.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> I was talking with Monica and Chandler.<br> Boy, they are really tight.<br> I know.<br> That's not a bad situation they got there.<br> Think I'll get me one of those.<br> What's up, Joe? I think Monica and Chandler are so great because they were friends first.<br> So I asked myself, who are my friends? You and Phoebe.<br> I saw you first, so.<br> -What are you saying? -Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.<br> You know, honey as flattered as I am that you saw me first I just don't think we should be cranking anything up.<br> I'll treat you real nice.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, you know.<br> I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date.<br> But the way you do it is you meet someone, become their friend build a foundation, then ask them out on a date.<br> Don't hit on your existing friends.<br> Won't that take longer? Oh, but once you find it it's so worth the wait.<br> I understand.<br> Good.<br> Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.<br> Come here to me.<br> No, no.<br> You come here to me.<br> -I brought reinforcements.<br> -Great! You brought Joey? The next best thing.<br> You brought Chandler? The next best thing would be Monica! I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so.<br> I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.<br> Rach, that's you.<br> That's the couch.<br> What's that? That's me.<br> Certainly think a lot of yourself.<br> No.<br> That's my arm.<br> I see.<br> I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.<br> Just follow my lead.<br> Come on, Chandler.<br> -All right.<br> -Okay.<br> Here we go.<br> All right.<br> Ready? Turn! Turn! Turn! -I don't think we can turn any more! -I don't think it'll fit! Yeah, it will.<br> Come on! Up, up, up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot! Pivot! Pivot! Pivot! Pivot! Pivot! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I don't think it'll pivot any more.<br> You think? All right, let's bring it back down and try again.<br> I think it's really stuck now.<br> -I can't believe that didn't work.<br> -I know.<br> Me neither.<br> I mean, you had a sketch.<br> What did you mean when you said "pivot"? Man, I cannot figure this out.<br> Yeah, because it's not 1985.<br> You guys, guess what? I ditched a cop.<br> -What? -What do you mean? He caught me using his badge and he tried to bust me.<br> Damn real cops! How far did he chase you? Well, he didn't really.<br> He just picked up his badge and stood there.<br> Maybe we'll see you on World's Most Boring Police Chases.<br> -Why did you run? -I had to.<br> You know, impersonating a cop is like a Class E felony.<br> Two to four years minimum.<br> I am not going back to that hellhole.<br> If I can just get it to pivot we'll be back on track.<br> -Rach, can I get some help please? -Yeah.<br> Turn it off! Turn it off! Maybe the firemen can help us move the couch when they get here.<br> -Wait, wait, wait.<br> -It's a new couch! It's a new couch! How's it going? Make any new friends? Yeah.<br> I met this woman.<br> What's she like? Well, she's really good in bed.<br> -You were going to be friends first.<br> -Hey, it's all your fault.<br> Why? You didn't give me advice.<br> You gave me a pickup line.<br> I told her I wanted to build a foundation and be friends first.<br> Suddenly, through no fault of my own, I became irresistible to her! And her roommate.<br> What about the closeness? Closeness, schmosness.<br> There was three of us, for crying out loud! Who wants pizza? I do! I do! I do! This is great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor? -Who is it? -N.<br>Y.<br>P.<br>D.<br> Oh, my God! Just a minute, officer! -I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.<br> -My God, it's him! It's that cop! -I can't believe he found me! -Are you gonna go to jail? If I go down, you guys go down with me.<br> Harboring a fugitive? That's one to three years minimum.<br> Good luck, Chandler.<br> Arrest me, but you'll never make it stick and you know it.<br> I have no choice, it's my job.<br> You understand, right? And you understand that I'm calling my lawyer.<br> And once he puts you on the stand, he'll make you look like a fool! I don't like looking foolish.<br> Maybe I don't arrest you today.<br> Maybe I came by and you weren't here.<br> I'd love it if I weren't here! Since you're not going to jail tonight, I was wondering if you'd Iike to go to dinner with me? Me? Ever since you flashed my badge I can't stop thinking about you.<br> You're the prettiest fake undercover whore I've ever seen.<br> Nice.<br> I didn't see that coming.<br> You're asking me out.<br> I could've done it better, but these people keep staring at me.<br> I'd like to go out with you, officer.<br> -Gary.<br> -Gary.<br> Okay, so it's a date.<br> I gotta ask you, though.<br> How'd you find me? I ran your fingerprints through the computer.<br> This was listed as your last known address.<br> Impressive.<br> Not as impressive as you.<br> Your record shows you've done some weird stuff.<br> We'll talk at dinner.<br> -So I'll come by and pick you up? -I can't wait.<br> Don't worry, I won't just take you out for doughnuts.<br> He has a gun! I'd like to return this couch.<br> I'm not satisfied with it.<br> You wanna return this couch? It's cut in half.<br> -That's what I'm telling you.<br> -Did you cut this couch in half? It's crazy, it is cut in half.<br> I don't understand.<br> This couch is cut in half.<br> I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half.<br> We can't accept it in this condition.<br> Well, I can't accept it in this condition.<br> You're saying this couch was delivered to you like this? Look, I'm a reasonable man.<br> I will accept store credit.<br> I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.<br> I will take it.<br>   <br>
