                    			What's so funny? Nothing.<br> It's an acting exercise.<br> I'm practicing my fake laugh.<br> What? What's so funny? No, no.<br> There's none of that in here.<br> Come on.<br> At least let me finish this last one.<br> Only if you give me a drag.<br> Oh, dark mother, once again I suckle at your smoky teat.<br> Why don't you hold on to that one.<br> That's like the least fun game ever.<br> I'm sick of your smoking, so I brought something.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that is going to help you quit.<br> That patch is no good.<br> It's a hypnosis tape.<br> A woman at work used it for two weeks and hasn't smoked since.<br> What's your problem? Nothing.<br> It's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.<br> I watched you get hypnotized in Atlantic City.<br> That guy did not hypnotize me, okay? You always pull your pants down and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.<br> Forget hypnosis.<br> The way to quit smoking is to dance naked in a field of heather.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then bathe in the sweat of six healthy, young men.<br> Or what my father calls "Thursday night.<br> " The One With the Hypnosis Tape .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) -Here you go.<br> -I didn't want cinnamon on this.<br> Sorry.<br> Oh, my God! Frank! How are you? What are you doing here? I would've called, but I lost your number.<br> And then my mom locked me out of the house, so I couldn't find it.<br> Then I tried to find a pay phone, and the receiver was cut off.<br> What happened? vandalism.<br> But also, what happened between you and your mom? We got in a fight.<br> She said that I was too immature to get married.<br> You're getting married? My little brother's getting married! I knew you'd be so cool about this.<br> Do you wanna meet her? Do l? Do you? Yeah, I do.<br> Cool, all right.<br> She's just parking the truck.<br> I gonna go get my fiancÃ©e, man! I'd have bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.<br> Isn't it fantastic? Don't you think he's a little young to get married? Well, he's 1 8.<br> It'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.<br> Yeah, or to get a hooker.<br> Always illegal, Joe.<br> This is my fiancÃ©e.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Mrs.<br> Knight.<br> That's my sister.<br> You know, it's funny.<br> Frank told me so much about you, but you're not how I pictured you at all.<br> Yeah, I'm a big surprise.<br> Here, grab a seat.<br> So how did you guys meet? I was in Mrs.<br> Knight's.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I mean, Alice.<br> Sorry.<br> I always do that.<br> I was in her home-ec class.<br> He was my best student.<br> She was my best teacher.<br> If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will? And so now you guys are gonna be married? We talked about just living together.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but we want kids right away.<br> Oh, my God! Great! Kids.<br> Frank, are you sure you're ready for that? How hard can it be? You know, I mean, babies.<br> Who doesn't want babies? Right? And besides, I never had a dad around.<br> And now I always will, because it'll be me.<br> Really, we do realize that there's an age difference between us.<br> Good.<br> Because you were acting like you didn't.<br> But when it comes to love, what does age matter? You are falling fast asleep.<br> Deeper, deeper, deeper.<br> You are now completely asleep.<br> You don 't need to smoke.<br> Cigarettes don 't control you.<br> You are a strong, confident woman  who does not need to smoke.<br> A strong, confident woman.<br> You know what? I realized in the last year I've only gone out with Richard and Julio.<br> You gotta help me out, set me up.<br> Get me back in the game.<br> Not a problem.<br> I work in fashion, and all I meet are eligible straight men.<br> Can I get you something else? Cheesecake and a date, if you're giving them out.<br> Haven't we covered that topic? You just said to her-- You wanna go out with me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because of my wig, the big boobs, and I serve you food.<br> If that were true, I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.<br> And the two times we went out, it was plain awkward.<br> You think she should go out with me, don't you? You sure you wanna go out with her? That ain't a pretty picture in the morning.<br> That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the nightstand.<br> Think about it.<br> Oh, I will.<br> No, I know.<br> I know that this is Frank's life.<br> I don't wanna be judgmental, but it's sick.<br> It's sick and wrong! What, is it the age thing? I'm fine with the age thing.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>until it sticks its tongue down my brother's throat.<br> Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.<br> You think he'll enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in diapers.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>of all the babies they have to have right away? This is not fair to Frank, and it's not fair to the babies.<br> You know what? It's not good home economics.<br> Have you told him how you feel? Yes.<br> Not out loud.<br> If you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.<br> Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.<br> Look at him and his mom.<br> I can't.<br> But you guys can.<br> You talk him out of it.<br> Come on, you guys.<br> You have nothing to lose.<br> I have everything to lose.<br> Do you want me to lose everything? Everything? Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.<br> We're walking down the street, and I turn to you and say: "Let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes.<br> " Remember? And then you say, "Let's just hang out at your place.<br> " Well, that was a nice move, dumb ass.<br> I think you should go out with this guy.<br> He doesn't do anything for me.<br> Last Saturday night, what happened on Walker, Texas Ranger? Walker was looking for this big busload of kids.<br> All right, I get your point.<br> I forgot the combination to this about a year ago.<br> I just carry it around.<br> You got any Chap Stick? How are those tapes working out? Good.<br> I haven't smoked yet today.<br> I feel great and confident.<br> That is a stunning blouse.<br> Thank you.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Thanks.<br> Let's give Pete a chance.<br> He was funny.<br> He seems really nice.<br> That check thing was adorable.<br> What check thing? As a joke, this customer who has a crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.<br> His number's on the check.<br> He did it so I'd call.<br> Pete Becker.<br> Pete-- Is this him? That's Bill Clinton.<br> Who's he hugging? Oh, my God.<br> That's Pete.<br> Why is Bill hugging Pete? This guy invented Moss 865.<br> Every office in the world uses that program.<br> -We use it! -There you go! Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.<br> I'm not gonna go out with him.<br> I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check.<br> This is so exciting.<br> Or incredibly offensive.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> That too.<br> What? All we're saying is, don't rush into anything.<br> Come on, think about it.<br> You're 1 8.<br> She's 44.<br> When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.<br> You don't think I know that? The point is.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>there's a lot of women you haven't had sex with yet.<br> He's right.<br> He's right.<br> This is your time.<br> You're young.<br> You're weird.<br> Chicks dig that.<br> Isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really care about? Yeah, in a poem, maybe.<br> No, the man's right.<br> That's what I had with Rachel.<br> Not anymore? No.<br> I slept with someone else.<br> So wait.<br> So how did that make things better? It didn't.<br> What you used to have with Rachel is what I got with Alice.<br> Now, what is that like? It's so cool, man.<br> It's because being with her is so much better than not being with her.<br> -Why can't I find that? -I had it and I blew it.<br> Well, I want it! You can have it.<br> Maybe there's something wrong with me.<br> No, it's out there, man.<br> I've seen it! I got it! -Then, you hold on to it! -All right, man! All right! Congratulations, you lucky bastard! You're Frank's best man? I couldn't help it.<br> Their love is so pure.<br> What about you, huh? I'm the ring bearer.<br> I'm so glad you could come.<br> I've got a real home-ec emergency.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Who died on this? It's a real "mustard-tastrophe.<br> " Can you help? Absolutely.<br> First, we'll start with a little club soda and salt.<br> -Then if that doesn't work-- -Forget it.<br> It's ruined.<br> Never say that.<br> If you can't get it out, cut around the stain.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.<br> Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother, Frank? Can we make it smaller? Make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.<br> You have Monica Geller here.<br> Absolutely.<br> Yeah, send her in.<br> What the hell is this? Hang on for a sec.<br> I'll talk to you in the morning? You got it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What? What's this supposed to mean? Well, you know, I never know how much to tip.<br> You double the tax.<br> Not double the tax of Romania.<br> Are you buying me? ls this how you get girls to go out with you? I'm still here.<br> You're taking this wrong.<br> If I didn't leave you that tip.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you wouldn't have come, we wouldn't have this argument.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and there wouldn't be this heat between us.<br> You gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.<br> You were the chef and I was the customer.<br> But now we're this couple that fights.<br> You're a loon.<br> Look, forget the check, okay? I like you.<br> I think you're great.<br> Come on, what do you say? I don't know.<br> Why not? I don't wanna encourage this behavior.<br> One meal.<br> That's all I'm asking for.<br> Please? We go out, we eat.<br> If you don't have a good time, I'll give you 1 0 grand, we're even.<br> Wait, no.<br> Just put the mail down.<br> It's me.<br> Sorry.<br> Why were you just all in the dark? Your laundry smelled so good that I thought I'd curl up in it.<br> -Is that all right? -Yeah, sure.<br> So how was your day? It's just probably the worst one since I've been alive.<br> What happened? Alice.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> She called it off.<br> Did she say why? No.<br> Just that I was too young.<br> I don't see how I could suddenly be too young.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because I'm older than I was when we first got together.<br> I don't know.<br> But you know what? Maybe it's just all for the best.<br> Well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.<br> Oh, sweetie.<br> You know, I was just finally happy.<br> For the first time in my life.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>after my dad left me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then getting arrested for stealing those birds.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then the whole punctured-lung thing.<br> It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.<br> And now it's gone, and I don't know why.<br> Well, I can tell you why.<br> It's because of me.<br> But you know what? I only did it because I love you, okay? What? I kind of had a little chat with Alice.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.<br> And you'll see it too, one day.<br> You really, really will.<br> Wait a minute.<br> This is because of you? My mother didn't want us to be together.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but the worst thing she did was tie me to the porch.<br> I came to you because I thought you'd understand.<br> I would storm out of here.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>if I had some money or a place to go.<br> Oh, my God! The millionaire's here! Oh, my God! I'm just gonna have dinner with him.<br> Okay, just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.<br> I know.<br> Okay, then get the lobster.<br> How much cash you got in your pocket now? And that's why I'm not inviting you in for a drink.<br> Why not? Hey, come in for drink.<br> -Where do you wanna go? -You like pizza? -That sounds great.<br> -I know a great little place.<br> You're not paying for the pizza.<br> Come on, it's only fair.<br> You paid for the flight.<br> Is that enough lira? I'd throw another 1 000 on that.<br> -How much is that? -That's about 60 cents.<br> Every night! You don 't need to smoke.<br> Cigarettes don 't control you.<br> You are a strong, confident woman  who does not need to smoke.<br> A strong, confident woman  who does not need to smoke.<br> Look, I know that you think I did this totally evil thing.<br> But I so didn't.<br> Someone's here who can explain this better than I can.<br> Hi, Mrs.<br> Knight.<br> Phoebe's right, Frank.<br> It's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it.<br> I was being selfish.<br> Even though we want the same things right now.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in the future, we may not.<br> -Is that what it is? -Yes, but not just that.<br> Not just that.<br> Even though we love each other as much as we do.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>nonetheless.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Nonetheless.<br> You're too young.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to really know what you want.<br> That's right, exactly.<br> That's a goodbye kiss.<br> That's good.<br> Bye-bye.<br> The important thing is, is that you see what I'm saying.<br> This is clearly wrong.<br> I've decided I'm gonna let this happen.<br> Can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good.<br> Cigarettes don 't control you.<br> You are a strong, confident woman  who does not need to smoke.<br> Joey's your best friend.<br> You wanna make him a cheese sandwich every day.<br> And you also wanna buy him hundreds of dollars worth ofpants.<br>   <br>
