                    			Guys, you won't believe this! - I just talked to my agent - Oh, my God! I'm sorry.<br> Too soon.<br> You go.<br> I got nominated for Days of Our Lives! - Good for you! - Congratulations! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy! - Soap Opera Digest Award? - No.<br> I'm up for a "Soapie.<br> " Is that something you're making up? No, no, no, it's real! And it has been, since 1998.<br> I'm up for a Soapie! Oh, my God! My God! That's the third most prestigious soap opera award there is! Thank you! I guess we know who I'll take to the awards! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there? Many are scheduled to appear.<br> - I can't go.<br> I'll be too nervous! - I'll go.<br> You're getting married.<br> This is all I have.<br> The One With Joey's Award Ernest Muhlbrat hypothesized that the velociraptor, when threatened would expand its collar and emit a high-pitched noise to frighten off predators.<br> Mr.<br> Lewis? What kind of noise? Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.<br> But like how? Well, we don't know for sure.<br> But in my head, it sounded something like this: Of course, this is just conjecture.<br> Okay.<br> That's all for today.<br> Mr.<br> Morse, can I see you for a moment? Yes, sir? I need to talk to you about your midterm exam.<br> - I'm afraid I had to fail you.<br> - Why? Well, you need 60% to pass.<br> - What did I get? - Seven.<br> That's not so good.<br> No, no, it's not.<br> What happened, Ned? Maybe you can cut me some slack.<br> I'm sort of in love.<br> I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.<br> I'm in love with you.<br> That brings me in the loop a little.<br> That's why I did so bad on this test.<br> I'm having a hard time concentrating.<br> When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious .<br> You look so good.<br> When you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater I'm your teacher.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You're a student.<br> And I like women.<br> In spite of what may be written on the backs of these chairs.<br> That guy at the counter's totally checking you out.<br> Really? - Oh, my God, he's really cute! - Go for it.<br> Phoebe, I'm engaged.<br> I'm saying, get his number, just in case.<br> But if Chandler's in an accident and can't perform sexually he'd want you to take a lover to satisfy needs he'd no longer fulfill.<br> Can I just tell you something? I'm very flattered, but I'm engaged.<br> This is kind of embarrassing.<br> I actually came over to talk to your friend.<br> You should be embarrassed.<br> - I thought you knew I looked at you.<br> - I did, but that was really fun.<br> "The winner is Joey Tribbiani! " "I honestly never expected this.<br> I didn't prepare a speech.<br> I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me.<br> Also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel" - I'm fourth? - Jeez! Look at you with your maple syrup award! Maybe you don't tell anyone about this? No big deal.<br> I do that with my shampoo bottle.<br> - Really? - Yeah.<br> - What award are you practicing for? - Grammy.<br> For Best New Artist.<br> The Soapies people called today.<br> I also get to present an award.<br> So you'll get on stage even if you don't win.<br> - You don't think I'll win? - Of course I do.<br> But Favorite Returning Character? That's a tough category.<br> You're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.<br> No, I know I might not win.<br> But it's just .<br> I've never been nominated.<br> I want it so much.<br> You'll probably get it.<br> But you should start practicing your "gracious-loser" face.<br> When the cameras are on you, you want to look disappointed.<br> But also that your colleague deserved to win.<br> Like: You know? - You practice losing the Grammys too? - No, at the Grammys, I always win.<br> - Hey! - How'd your date go with Jake? Great.<br> We couldn't keep our eyes off each other.<br> Every once in a while, he'd lean over, stroke my hair, then touch my neck.<br> Stop it.<br> You're getting me all tingly.<br> All I could think of was, is he gonna kiss me? - Did he? - I'm a lady.<br> I don't kiss and tell.<br> But this hickey speaks for itself.<br> Okay, I got it.<br> I got it.<br> I like him so much, I feel like I've had 10 drinks today.<br> I've only had six.<br> I haven't had that feeling since I first went out with Chandler.<br> - I'll never have that feeling again.<br> - You sound like a guy.<br> No, a guy would say, "I'll never get to sleep with anyone else.<br> " I'll never sleep with anyone else! I'm so busy planning the wedding, I forgot about what I'll give up.<br> I'll never have a first kiss again.<br> You'll have a last kiss.<br> Can I ask you something? Has a guy ever had a crush on you? Is that why you wanted to tie my tie? A kid in my class said he's in love with me.<br> Whoa! - Whoa, what? - Ross has a boyfriend! I do not have a boyfriend.<br> There's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me.<br> - Really? - Yeah.<br> Last year, Elizabeth, now this kid .<br> What is it? Am I giving out some kind of sexy-professor vibe? Not right now.<br> The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.<br> Now I feel bad for the kid.<br> I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard.<br> I couldn't concentrate.<br> I blushed every time he looked at me.<br> You remember what it's like to be 19 and in love.<br> - I can cut him some slack.<br> - Yeah.<br> - How'd you get over that teacher? - I didn't.<br> I got under him.<br> Problem solved.<br> - Bye, Phoebe.<br> - Okay, bye.<br> - All right.<br> Bye.<br> - Bye.<br> We said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.<br> It's okay.<br> You don't have to tiptoe around me.<br> I've thought about it.<br> You know what? I'm okay, not having that new-relationship feeling.<br> - I miss you already! - I miss you too! That's great, but I wouldn't trade what I have for that.<br> I'll be with Chandler the rest of my life.<br> That makes me happy.<br> Come sit down.<br> We're talking about how our relationship's deep and meaningful.<br> It is, don't you think? Oh, totally.<br> Pull my finger.<br> - Favorite Returning Male - This is my category! - Got your speech? - Got my speech.<br> Got your gracious-loser face? Try to remember, if you win, you have to hug me.<br> Can I squeeze your ass? On TV? Yeah! In the Favorite Returning Male character category, the nominees are: John Wheeler from General Hospital.<br>  Gavin Graham from The Young and the Restless.<br>  Duncan Harrington from Passions.<br>  And Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.<br>  And the Soapie goes to: Gavin Graham from The Young and the Restless.<br>  Presenting the Favorite Supporting Actress award: Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.<br>  Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award deserves to take it home.<br> Unfortunately, only one can.<br> The nominees for Favorite Supporting Actress are: From Passions, Erin Goff.<br> From One Life to Live,  Mary Lauren Bishop.<br> All My Children,  Sarah Renee.<br> And from Days of Our Lives,  Jessica Ashley.<br> And the winner is: Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives.<br>  Unfortunately, Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll accept this award on her behalf.<br> And I'm sure that Jessica wants to thank my parents who always believed in me.<br> She'd also like to thank my friends: Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe and Rachel who's sitting right there.<br> Why'd we rush out so fast? We had to get out of there because Look what I won! Oh, my God.<br> You stole her award! No, no, no.<br> I'm accepting it on her behalf.<br> I don't think you know what "behalf" means.<br> Sure I do.<br> It's a verb.<br> As in "I be half-in' it"! - You've got to take this back.<br> - I should've won.<br> I really wanted it.<br> She didn't care enough to come to the thing.<br> It could also be a Grammy.<br> No, Joey.<br> No one saw me take it.<br> There's a whole table of them.<br> Do you want an award you didn't win? No, I want an award I did win.<br> But nobody's given me any of those! If I put it up, when people come over, they'll see it and think I won it.<br> Joey, it says "Best Supporting Actress.<br> " I can scratch that right off.<br> This is wrong.<br> You have to take it back.<br> You don't want to win an award this way.<br> You're very talented.<br> Someday you'll win one of these for real and that one will mean something.<br> - Oh, all right.<br> - All right? Thank you.<br> I'll take it back tomorrow.<br> If I can't have it, you can't have it! - Professor Geller? - Yes, Mr.<br> Lewis? How can I help you? I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff.<br> But I was hoping you could change my grade.<br> And why, exactly, would I do that? Because I'm in love with you.<br> What? Yeah.<br> I'm all in love with you and stuff.<br> - So could you change my grade? - No! Why not? You changed Ned's grade.<br> That's different.<br> Because he was actually in love with me.<br> No, he's not! He's totally yanking your chain.<br> He's done this with three other teachers.<br> - What? - He's got a girlfriend.<br> I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.<br> I know.<br> It's awful.<br> I love you.<br> - Have you seen Chandler? - No, why? I keep thinking about all the things I won't have.<br> It's freaking me out.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Don't sweat it.<br> Chandler's not around, so get it out of your system.<br> That guy's cute.<br> Come on, I'm serious.<br> - I've got to talk to him about this.<br> - That's the last thing you want to do.<br> - Why? - Because you're marrying him! You gotta help me out here.<br> I've never been engaged.<br> I've never really been married.<br> I can only tell you what my mother told me.<br> When you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship don't communicate them to your husband.<br> I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm spending the rest of my life with? That is correct.<br> Yes.<br> You're supposed to put all that stuff in a little box in your mind and lock it up.<br> Your mother told you this? The woman who married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13? Oh, my God, you're right.<br> Tell Chandler.<br> Hurry, before it's too late! Wait! Does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love? - I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley! - Wait, wait.<br> Rach, please be cool, okay? I work with this woman.<br> Okay, I'm totally cool.<br> Come in.<br> Hey, Jessica.<br> Hey, Jess.<br> This is my friend Rachel.<br> - Hi.<br> - What's up? Here's your Soapie.<br> I accepted it for you.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I won? Do you have any idea what this means? You're not gonna put it on your shelf or anything? No, I try to save that for real awards.<br> Now if you'll excuse me? - Take it back? - Absolutely.<br> Yeah, you do! Honey? As we get closer to the wedding is there anything you'd like to share? Okay.<br> I think the centerpieces are too big.<br> You're wrong.<br> The centerpieces are fine.<br> - Do you ever get scared at all? - Kind of.<br> They're really big.<br> Doesn't it freak you out that you'll never be with anybody new again? What? I love you so much.<br> Sometimes it bothers me that I'll never have that feeling.<br> When you first meet someone and it's new and exciting.<br> You know that rush? No, when I first meet somebody it's mostly panic, anxiety and a great deal of sweating.<br> Okay.<br> But you're a guy.<br> Aren't you freaked out that you'll never sleep with anybody else? Sleeping with somebody, no.<br> Anxiety, panic and, I'm afraid, even more sweating.<br> Even with me? I was dangerously dehydrated the first six months of our relationship.<br> For me, the rush is knowing that we'll be together the rest of our lives.<br> - Really? - Well, yeah.<br> Knowing you're having these thoughts, we're back to panic, anxiety and I'll definitely need some kind of sports drink.<br> Come here.<br> Oh, you don't have to worry.<br> Besides, you know what? I'll have a lot of new things with you.<br> The first time we buy a house.<br> Our first kid.<br> Our first grandkid.<br> Water.<br> Water.<br> Water.<br> Mr.<br> Morse? Can I speak to you for a moment? That was a great lecture today.<br> Did you get a little haircut? Yeah, yeah.<br> Do you like it? Do you love it? I want you to know I'm changing your grade back.<br> What? Why? I know what you're trying to pull here.<br> It won't work.<br> I'm not trying to pull anything.<br> Look, I love you, dude.<br> I'm not even gonna talk about this.<br> This little "thing" is over.<br> I know you have a girlfriend.<br> And I know about the other professors.<br> How do you think that makes me feel? You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Professor Winston.<br> Professor Frederickson.<br> I'll be right with you.<br> Don't make this worse and I'll give you a "C.<br> " Shall we? I'll be out in a second.<br> "It's just so unexpected! I'll tell you, it's such an honor to just be nominated for a Nobel Prize.<br> And, you know, to win one for a massage! Especially just after winning a Tony Award for Best Actress" Our reservations are at 8.<br> "in Reservations at Eight by Neil Simon.<br> Thank you, Neil.<br> Thank you for the words.<br> " Finish this later.<br> We're gonna be late.<br> Please don't play the music.<br> Just one more thing.<br> Okay.<br> "Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!
