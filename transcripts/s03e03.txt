                    			Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed! The One With the Jam .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) Hey, look at me! I' m making jam! -I've been at it since 4 a.<br>m.<br> -Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.<br>m.<br>? Down at the docks.<br> You know, you can get it wholesale.<br> I didn't know there were docks.<br> Is it broken? No, but I gotta wear this for a couple weeks.<br> You tell the doctor you did it jumping on your bed? No.<br> I had a whole story worked out, but then.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Chandler sold me out.<br> I didn't think the doctor would buy that it "fell out of the socket.<br> " What is this? Fruit? Monica's making jam.<br> Jam? I love jam! How come we never have jam at our place? Because the kids need new shoes.<br> I' m going into business.<br> I' m sick of being depressed about Richard.<br> I needed a plan.<br> A plan to get over my man.<br> What's the opposite of man? Jam! Joey, don't! It's way too hot! This'll just be my batch.<br> That's it.<br> Hey, you, J .<br> Crew guy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Why are you following me? All week, everywhere I look, there's you.<br> You wouldn't return my calls.<br> You sent back my letters.<br> One more chance, Ursula.<br> Please.<br> This is awkward.<br> Yeah, because you want Ursula, and I' m Phoebe.<br> Twin sisters.<br> Seriously.<br> That's great.<br> I' m stalking the wrong woman.<br> I am such a dingus! Oh, you' re not a dingus.<br> I just want you to know I wasn't always like this.<br> Before I met your sister, I was a normal guy who sold cellular phones.<br> Look, it's not your fault.<br> I mean, this is just what she does to guys, okay? Well, thanks.<br> Wait.<br> I got a little story.<br> Once, in junior high school, I thought I was a witch.<br> And a guidance counselor told me something that might help you.<br> He said, "Okay, you' re not a witch.<br> You' re just an average student.<br> " -See what I' m saying? -Not really.<br> Well, get over it.<br> You seem like a really nice guy.<br> Don't be so hard on yourself, okay? You' re right.<br> I know you' re right.<br> And thanks for being so nice.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> Want to get some coffee? You don't have to walk behind me anymore.<br> "Gone for more jars.<br> Be back later.<br> Monica Geller.<br> " Wait a minute.<br> Look! It's an empty apartment.<br> We' re all alone in an empty apartment.<br> I have to be at work in 1 0 minutes.<br> All right.<br> It's not like I' m employee of the year or anything.<br> There it is! Oh, that's what you mean.<br> Do I look fat? No.<br> I accept that.<br> When Janice asked me and I said no, she thought I was calling her a cow.<br> Walk us through it, honey.<br> Walk us through it.<br> Janice said, "Hi.<br> Do I look fat today?" And I looked at her-- You looked at her? You never look.<br> You just answer.<br> It's like a reflex.<br> "Do I look fat?" "No.<br> " "Is she prettier than I am?" "No.<br> " "Does size matter?" And it works both ways.<br> So you both just know this stuff? After 30 or 40 fights, you kind of catch on.<br> Okay.<br> For instance: Janice is coming back from a trip.<br> She gives you two options.<br> Option one: She'll take a cab home from the airport.<br> Option two: You can meet her at baggage claim.<br> What do you do? Easy.<br> Baggage claim.<br> Wrong! Now you' re single.<br> It's actually secret option number three.<br> You meet her at the gate.<br> That way she knows you love her.<br> Okay, this is good.<br> All right, I have one.<br> Janice likes to cuddle.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>at night, which I' m all for.<br> But when you want to go to sleep, you want some space.<br> So how do I tell her that without.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you know, accidentally calling her fat or something? Sorry, honey.<br> We can't help you there, because we' re cuddly sleepers.<br> I' m late for work.<br> -Are you guys coming down? -Yeah.<br> I' m right behind you.<br> Good luck, Chandler.<br> The sleeping thing.<br> very tricky business, but solvable.<br> I thought you were "cuddly sleepers.<br> " No, not cuddly.<br> Not me.<br> Just her.<br> I' m like you.<br> I need the room.<br> Okay, come here.<br> Okay.<br> You' re in bed.<br> I'll use the cushion.<br> Okay.<br> You' re in bed.<br> She's over on your side, cuddling.<br> Now, you wait for her to drift off.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then you hug her.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and roll her over to her side of the bed.<br> And then you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>roll away.<br> Hug for her.<br> Roll for you.<br> The old "hug and roll.<br> " One question.<br> You' re pretending the pillow's a girl, right? Remember when you were a kid, your mom would send you to the movies.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>with a jar of jam and a little spoon? You' re so pretty.<br> You know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.<br> You talked to him? Are you crazy? First, I' m not crazy.<br> And second, say it, don't spray it.<br> Anyway, his name is Malcolm, and he wasn't following me.<br> I mean, he was, but he thought I was Ursula.<br> That's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me.<br> Because of the restraining order.<br> Not feeling better about Malcolm.<br> No, no, he's not a kook.<br> He's just this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that just got a teensy bit carried away.<br> We get along really well, and he's so cute.<br> Oh, my God! You've got a crush on your sister's stalker.<br> I' m going to help him get "de-Ursula-ized.<br> " Like I did for Joey after he went out with her.<br> I didn't stalk her.<br> I asked for the news, not the weather.<br> Joey, this is for you.<br> It's blackberry currant.<br> Joe, I got to ask.<br> The girl from the xerox place, buck naked.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or a big tub of jam? Put your hands together.<br> Take your time with that.<br> It's my last batch.<br> No more jam? What happened to your jam plan? I figured out I'd need to charge $ 1 7 a jar just to break even.<br> So I've got a new plan now.<br> Babies.<br> Well, you'll need much bigger jars.<br> -What are you talking about? -About me having a baby.<br> -Are you serious? -Yeah.<br> The jam plan helped me take control of my life.<br> So I thought, "What is the most important thing to me?" And that's when I came up with the baby plan.<br> Aren't you forgetting something? What is that guy's name? Dad! It took me 28 years to find a man I wanted to spend my life with.<br> If I have to wait another 28 years, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.<br> And that's just stupid.<br> That's what's stupid? I don't need an actual man.<br> Just a few of his best swimmers.<br> And there are places you can go to get that.<br> .<br> .<br>stuff.<br> Down to the docks again? Night-night, Bing-a-ling.<br> Night-night.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Janice.<br> Look at all the room on her side! A giant penguin could fit over there.<br> That'd be weird, though.<br> Hug and roll time.<br> I'm hugging.<br> I'm hugging.<br> You're rolling, and.<br> Yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck.<br> Stuck arm.<br> Time for the old tablecloth trick.<br> One fluid motion.<br> Quick like a cat.<br> And one, two  three! Here's my binoculars.<br> Oh, great.<br> You' re doing great.<br> Going strong.<br> Keep going.<br> These are my night-vision goggles.<br> This is the book I pretend to read when I' m watching her in the park.<br> And these are Madlibs.<br> They' re just for fun.<br> This is the log I kept, recording her every movement.<br> Want to hear some of it? Not even a little bit.<br> It's about you.<br> Okay then.<br> "I met Phoebe today.<br> She was really nice to me even though I' m such a loser.<br> And when I was walking home, I thought about her a lot.<br> It was weird, but kind of cool.<br> " Good.<br> So what were you thinking? I was thinking what it'd be like to kiss you.<br> -Really? -No.<br> That's just something I said now so that maybe I could kiss you.<br> Oh, okay.<br> No, it's all right.<br> I just had a jar of mustard.<br> Okay.<br> Sperm donor number 0381 5, come on down! Okay, he's 6' 2", 1 70 pounds.<br> He describes himself as a male Gina Davis.<br> You mean there's more than one of us? You can't do this, Mon.<br> If you do this, I'll-- -You'll what? -I'll tell Mom.<br> I' m sorry, but he's right.<br> I love you, but you' re crazy.<br> Why? Why is this crazy? -So this isn't the ideal way-- -Oh, it's not-- Lips moving.<br> Still talking.<br> It may not be ideal, but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I' m so ready.<br> I see the way Ben looks at you.<br> It makes me ache, you know? Check it out! Jam crackers! Okay.<br> All right, how's this? Twenty-seven, ltalian-American guy.<br> He's an actor.<br> Born in Queens.<br> Wow! Big family.<br> Seven sisters.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and he's the only.<br> .<br> .<br>boy.<br> Oh, my God! Under personal comments: "New York Knicks rule.<br> " Yeah, the Knicks rule! Joey, this is you! Let me see.<br> Oh, right! You went to a sperm bank? Right after I did that sex study at NYU.<br> Remember that sweater I gave you? That's how you bought it? No.<br> That's what I was wearing when I donated.<br> I' m surprised there's any of my boys left.<br> It is pretty competitive.<br> There's an actual rocket scientist here.<br> Maybe I should have them put my Days of our Lives gig on here.<br> Juice this up a little.<br> How's the maniac? He's yummy.<br> We did a little kissing.<br> Phoebe, what are you doing? No, no.<br> He's not into that anymore.<br> He quit for me.<br> This guy has been obsessed with your sister for God knows how long.<br> You don't just give that up.<br> He gave me his night-vision goggles and everything.<br> You' re taking the word of a guy who has night-vision goggles? He's not still following her.<br> You think he's still following her? Wake up and smell the restraining order.<br> What should I do? If you really like this guy, you should just trust him.<br> Thank you, Monica.<br> Or you could follow him.<br> That's what I'd do.<br> Forget mine.<br> What happened? Crazy Chandler spun me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>off the bed.<br> Wow! Spinning! Sounds like fun.<br> I wish.<br> He was just trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.<br> Ross' what? Where he hugs you and then he rolls you away, and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Oh.<br> .<br> .<br>my.<br> .<br> .<br>God! What are you doing? Oh, I was just here looking for my.<br> .<br> .<br>my.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Part of an old sandwich.<br> Here it is! Were you following me? Perhaps.<br> Yes.<br> I' m sorry.<br> I was afraid you were still hung up on my sister.<br> So you spied on me.<br> I can't believe you don't trust me.<br> Well, what do you know? There goes my identical twin sister! Just walking along, looking like me.<br> Is this a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train? I' m sorry.<br> I' m sorry.<br> I tried to stop, but I couldn't.<br> I' m so pathetic.<br> No, it's not your fault.<br> It's partly my fault.<br> I made you quit cold turkey.<br> Well, I can't date you anymore because you' re, you know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Wow! But I will definitely help you get over my sister.<br> Okay? Stalk me for a while, huh? I'll be like an Ursula patch.<br> I don't know.<br> Just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Look, I' m going! Come on.<br> I' m on the pillar.<br> Which way will I go? -Where you going? -To the bank.<br> Sperm or regular? Sperm.<br> You' re really doing it? Oh, yeah.<br> I picked a guy.<br> Sounds nice.<br> He does.<br> He's got brown hair and green eyes.<br> No kidding? I figured you'd have picked a blond.<br> Really? Why? I always pictured you with a tall, smart, blond guy with a name like.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Hoyt.<br> It's a name.<br> Yeah.<br> I saw you in this great house with a big pool.<br> Is he a swimmer? He's got the body for it.<br> I like that.<br> What? You have a sign that says: "We don't swim in your toilet.<br> Don't pee in our pool.<br> " We don't have that sign.<br> You do! It was a gift from me.<br> And you have three great kids.<br> Two girls and a boy? And they wear little water wings, and they run around on the deck.<br> And Hoyt wraps a towel around all three of them.<br> Sure.<br> But, you know, this way sounds good too.<br> Yeah.<br> Wow! This guy's an astronaut? That would have been cool.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>for a day.<br> I called the sperm bank.<br> They haven't sold a single unit of Tribbiani.<br> Nobody wants my product.<br> I don't get it.<br> Maybe if they met me in person.<br> You got a thing on your.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Get it? Yeah.<br> Hello.<br> Hello.<br> Chan, can I talk to you for a second? Sure.<br> What's up? Just one additional relationship thought.<br> Something you' re probably aware of.<br> Women talk.<br>   <br>
