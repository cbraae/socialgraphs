You guys, look.<br> Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.<br> The One With the Evil Orthodontist Years from now, school children will study it as one of the greatest first dates ever.<br> -Yeah.<br> -I'll say, yeah.<br> It was unbelievable.<br> We could be ourselves.<br> We didn't have to play games.<br> -Have you called her? -She'd know I like her.<br> That's crazy.<br> Guys.<br> It's gross.<br> It's the next day.<br> How needy do I wanna seem? -I'm right.<br> Right? -Yeah, let her dangle.<br> I can't believe my parents are pushing me to find one of you people.<br> Come on.<br> Just do it.<br> Call her.<br> Stop being so testosterone-y.<br> Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.<br> -Her machine.<br> -Answering machine? No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up.<br> So, why didn't you say anything? No.<br> Last time I left a spontaneous message  I ended up using the phrase, "Yes, indeed-io.<br>" Look, it's Rachel and Barry.<br> Don't everybody look.<br> What's going on? -They're just talking.<br> -Does he look upset? Does he look like he was told to shove anything? No.<br> Actually, he's smiling.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Don't do that.<br> What? What? What? That man across the street just kicked that pigeon.<br> And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.<br> See? Hey, Rach.<br> How'd it go? You know, it was actually really great.<br> Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.<br> I had that chicken, where you poke it and butter squirts out.<br> Not a good day for birds.<br> Then we went to Bendel's.<br> And I told him not to, but he got me a bottle of Chanel.<br> That's nice.<br> Now was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending flowers and to leave you alone? Right.<br> Well, we never actually got to that.<br> It was just so nice to see him again.<br> It was comfortable and it was familiar.<br> It was just nice.<br> That's nice twice.<br> Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar? Where have you been? It was different with him today.<br> He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.<br> I mean, we had fun.<br> Is there anything wrong with that? -Why? -I have my reasons.<br> He's engaged to another woman who happens to be your ex-best friend? All right.<br> I know it's stupid.<br> I'll see him this afternoon and put an end to it.<br> I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.<br> No, it wasn't.<br> It was so nice having this little sink here.<br> Then with authority, hang up.<br> Will you just leave her the message? Okay.<br> All right, fine.<br> "Oh, Danielle, I wasn't expecting the machine.<br> Give me a call when you get a chance.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Oh, God.<br> That's what you've been working on for two hours? Hey, I've been honing.<br> -What was with the dishes? -She might think I'm in a restaurant.<br> I might have a life.<br> Like I haven't been sitting here  honing for the last two hours? -The telescope guy's doing it again.<br> -Oh, my God.<br> Go away.<br> Stop looking in here.<br> Great.<br> Now he's waving back.<br> We gotta do something.<br> I caught him looking into our place.<br> I feel like I can't do stuff.<br> What kind of stuff? Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff but, like, when I'm cooking naked.<br> You cook naked? Yeah, toast, oatmeal.<br> Nothing that spatters.<br> What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.<br> What's the matter? I just Oh, Barry, this was not good.<br> No, it was.<br> It was very, very good.<br> -What about Mindy? -Way better than Mindy.<br> I mean, what about you and Mindy? If you want, I'll break it off with her.<br> No, don't do that.<br> Not for me.<br> Dr.<br> Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.<br> Thanks, Bernice.<br> Let's go away this weekend.<br> -This is all way too -No, we can go to Aruba.<br> When I went there on what would've been our honeymoon it was really nice.<br> You would've liked it.<br> I had a bra.<br> Hey, Dr.<br> Farber.<br> All right, Miss Greene, everything looks fine.<br> We're starting to see some real progress.<br> -What? -I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.<br> Can I use your phone? For future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.<br> Yes, it's working.<br> -Why isn't she calling? -Maybe she never got your message.<br> Call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps that means she didn't get her messages yet.<br> -Doesn't that make me seem? -Desperate? Needy? Pathetic? You obviously saw my personal ad.<br> How many beeps? She answered.<br> This is where you'd use that "hello" word.<br> I won't talk to her.<br> She got my message and is choosing not to call me.<br> Now I'm needy and snubbed.<br> God, I miss just being needy.<br> So how'd he take it? Pretty well, actually.<br> How come you have dental floss in your hair? Oh, do l? -We ended up having sex in his chair.<br> -You had sex in his chair? I said that a little too loudly, didn't l? You had what? Sex in his chair.<br> What? What were you thinking? I don't know.<br> We still care about each other.<br> There's a history there.<br> It's like you and Carol.<br> It's nothing like me and Carol.<br> If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch  right here, right now," what would you say? If it helps, I could slide over.<br> It's a totally different situation.<br> It's apples and oranges.<br> It's orthodontists and lesbians I gotta go.<br> -Where are you going? -I just have to go.<br> I have things to do with my life.<br> I have a jam-packed schedule.<br> And I am late for keeping up with it, okay? Mindy.<br> How are you? Yes, I heard.<br> Congratulations.<br> That is so great.<br> Really, oh, God I'm working tomorrow, but if you want, you can come by if you'd like.<br> Great.<br> Great.<br> So I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Okay.<br> Bye.<br> Oh, God.<br> Oh, God.<br> So how's Mindy? She wants to see me tomorrow.<br> She sounded weird.<br> I gotta call Barry.<br> It's me.<br> I just Mindy.<br> Mindy.<br> No, I figured that's where you'd be.<br> Hell is filled with people like you.<br> He's back.<br> The peeper's back.<br> -Get down.<br> -Get down? And boogie.<br> I gotta go and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.<br> She may not even know.<br> I haven't heard from her in seven months, what else is it about? She was my best friend.<br> We went to camp together, she taught me how to kiss.<br> Now, you know, I'm, like, the other woman.<br> -I feel so -Naughty.<br> -See you later.<br> -I'll walk with you.<br> When she taught you to kiss, were you wearing any kind of little uniform? That's fine, yeah.<br> I'm going to the bathroom.<br> Will you watch my phone? -Take it with you.<br> -We haven't had a second date -she needs to hear me pee? -Why don't you call her? I can't.<br> I left a message.<br> I have some pride.<br> -Do you? -No.<br> Danielle, hi.<br> It's Chandler.<br> I'm fine.<br> Listen.<br> I don't know if you tried to call me because  I accidentally shut off my phone.<br> That's fine.<br> That's great.<br> Okay.<br> She's on the other line.<br> She's gonna call me back.<br> She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.<br> -Don't you have to pee? -That's why I'm dancing.<br> -Mindy.<br> -Hey, you.<br> Hey, you.<br> So what's up? We should really be sitting for this.<br> Sure we should.<br> I'm gonna ask once, and I want a straight answer.<br> Not like when I asked if those red pants made my ass look big.<br> I know things have been weird but you're my oldest friend, except for Laurie who's bitter because she lost weight and it turns out, she doesn't have a pretty face.<br> -Okay, I'm just gonna say it.<br> -Okay.<br> Will you be my maid of honor? -Of course.<br> -That's so great.<br> It is.<br> It is.<br> It is.<br> -That's all you wanted to ask? -That's all.<br> -What? -That's not all.<br> -Oh, sure it is.<br> -Oh, no, it isn't.<br> I think Barry's seeing someone in the city.<br> What would make you think that? Since the engagement, he's acted weird.<br> And then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.<br> Really? If it'll make you feel any better when Barry and I got engaged, he was weird too.<br> Oh, God.<br> That's what I was afraid of.<br> What's what you were afraid of? When Barry was engaged to you, he and l  kind of had a little thing on the side.<br> -What? -I know, I know.<br> When he proposed, people said, "He'll do to you what he did to Rachel.<br>" And now I feel so stupid.<br> You are so stupid.<br> We are both so stupid.<br> What do you mean?

Really? She said you looked like lngrid Bergman.<br> Did she mention me? She wants to know why you tie the towel around your head.<br> It's a leave-in conditioner, okay? It's a leave-in conditioner.<br> -You got a second? -Sure, sure.<br> Come on -in.<br> -Hello, sweetheart.<br> What you guys doing here? We are here to break up with you.<br> Both of you?

If I'm hogging the ball, you jump right in there and take some punches.<br> This feels great.<br> I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.<br> What are you talking about?
