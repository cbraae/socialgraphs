Oh, yes, they are.<br> The One With Ross' Grant Hey, honey.<br> Hey, sweetie.<br> - Is Monica not here? - No.<br> Then I'll tell you.<br> My agency was bidding for a big account, and they got it.<br> - It's my first national commercial.<br> - Cool.<br> And I don't want to brag, but a lot of the ideas were mine.<br> Hell, you weren't there.<br> All the ideas were mine.<br> That's great.<br> Hey, can you cast me in it? I really don't think you're right for the part.<br> What do you mean? I can do anything.<br> I'm a chameleon.<br> I'm old.<br> I'm tired.<br> Oh, I am hot.<br> I'm cold.<br> Come on, what can't I do? First of all, bravo.<br> But I don't think you're right for this.<br> The part's a stuffy college professor.<br> I can do that.<br> Hello, I'm your professor.<br> When I'm not busy thinking of important things, or professing I like to use What's the product? Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions.<br> I'm cold.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant? I'll give you a hint.<br> He's looking right at you.<br> Well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt I'm gonna say, "Congratulations.<br>" I'm so excited.<br> Apparently, I beat out hundreds of other applicants including five guys I went to graduate school with.<br> Not that I'm keeping score, or anything.<br> Five.<br> - Wow, that's great.<br> - Yeah.<br> - So tell me about the grant.<br> - Well, okay, it's for $25,000.<br> And if I get it, I'll be able to complete my field research.<br> And there will be an article about me in the Paleontology Review.<br> It'll be the first time my name is in there without people raising serious questions about my work.<br> - Are you talking about the Dewer Grant? - Yeah.<br> Why? Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.<br> - Your ex-boyfriend? - Yeah.<br> So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.<br> No.<br> No, we ended on great terms.<br> If anything, I think this could help you.<br> You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner, and I can introduce you.<br> - lf you think it'd help.<br> - Yeah, absolutely.<br> I'll call him.<br> Now, is there anything I could do to butter him up? Anything he really likes? He does have a pretty serious latex fetish.<br> We'll see how dinner goes.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey, you want to go see a movie? I told you I had to spend all day clearing out stuff so Mike could move in.<br> - Oh, right.<br> - Yeah.<br> Now that I'm here, I might as well help with the cleaning and organizing.<br> I just happen to have my label maker.<br> Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.<br> Did you and Chandler make compromises when you moved in together? Chandler did.<br> - What does he want you to give up? - A bunch of stuff.<br> And the worst one, he wants me to get rid of Gladys.<br> Who's Gladys? Oh, what a tragic loss.<br> Yeah, I really hate to give her up.<br> Oh, I know.<br> Oh, you should take her.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> - What, you don't like her? - Of course I do.<br> What's not to like? I'd take her in a minute.<br> But I think that you're giving up too easy.<br> I think that you need to fight for her.<br> - Really, you think? - Absolutely.<br> You say to him, "I'm sorry, Mike, I can't live without her.<br> She means too much to me.<br>" Okay, I'll fight for her.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, wait.<br> I just realized, if I do that, that means you don't get her.<br> Damn it, I did not think this through.<br> - Hey, guys.<br> - Hi.<br> Oh, any word on casting yet? - I told you, you're not right for the part.<br> - What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from? I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.<br> Look, come on, please? It's not like I'm asking you for some crazy favor.<br> This is what I do for a living.<br> I am a professional actor.<br> Man, I'm two hours late for work.<br> Here's my reel.<br> It's got all the commercials that I've been in.<br> - Joe - Just watch it.<br> If you don't like it, don't pass it on to your bosses.<br> - Fine.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Work, Joe.<br> - Damn it.<br> - What am I gonna do now? - Just pass the tape along.<br> He's not right for the part.<br> If I suggest him, my bosses will think I'm an idiot.<br> And that's something they should learn on their own.<br> Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't.<br> Then you're the good guy, and they're the bad guy.<br> That's good.<br> I liked it, they didn't.<br> Joey, for God's sake, go to work.<br> I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.<br> I've always thought of him as someone I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party.<br> Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO? Sorry, it looks like it's just him.<br> Charlie.<br> My God, you look absolutely stunning.<br> Well, I am having a good hair day.<br> - It's so good to see you.<br> - Oh, you too.<br> I'm okay.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Ross Geller, Benjamin Hobart.<br> It's an honor to meet you.<br> I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work.<br> I mean, that Nobel Prize.<br> I mean, I have to tell you that you're one of the reasons I got into the field.<br> Well, likewise.<br> Not likewise.<br> I'd never heard of you until this morning.<br> But it's nice to be nice.<br> - Shall we? - Yeah.<br> Thank you.<br> I can't believe that you chose this restaurant.<br> - Do you remember the night? - Oh, my God.<br> I completely forgot.<br> Oh, my God, I can't believe they let us back in this place.<br> You weren't there.<br> No, but, you know, it's just a funny image.<br> You know, the two of you in this restaurant with the Why don't you tell Benji about your proposal while I go to the ladies' room.<br> So tell me about it.<br> Okay.<br> Well, I would like to do a dig in the Painted Desert.<br> There are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.<br> - Break up with Charlie.<br> - What? What? Did you just say, "Break up with Charlie"? Well, yes and no.<br> Yes, I did say it.<br> And no, I didn't not say it.<br> - Kind of inappropriate, don't you think? - Listen, I'm sorry.<br> I just haven't seen her for so long, all these feelings are rushing back.<br> I'm starting to realize how much I've missed her.<br> And I'm gonna need you to break up with her.<br> - Are you serious? - lf you say, yes, then I'm serious.<br> If you say, no, then I'm joking.<br> - No.<br> - Joking it is.<br> - Hi, sorry I'm late.<br> - Hey, how'd it go with Mike? - Is he gonna let you keep the painting? - No, he really hates it.<br> But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair.<br> So you gotta pick your battles.<br> But the good news is, Gladys is yours.<br> Wow, what's the bad news? - Who's Gladys? - Oh, she's that work of art I made.<br> You know, with the woman coming out of the frame.<br> And Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous.<br> I didn't know you wanted her too.<br> Well, I mean, sure, of course.<br> But you already gave that to Monica, so - You know, I would give her up for you.<br> - No, I couldn't let you do that.<br> - No, but I want to.<br> - But I don't want you to.<br> - But I insist.<br> - But I insist harder.<br> Girls.<br> Girls.<br> Stop.<br> Okay, we'll flip a coin.<br> Heads, she's Rachel's.<br> Tails, she's Monica's.<br> - Tails.<br> Monica, she's yours.<br> - No, that landed in your food.<br> No, no, that's okay.<br> You won fair and square.<br> I'm so sad.<br> - Hey, Joe? - What's up? Bad news.<br> I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.<br> I'm sorry, man.<br> - But you watched the tape? - Yeah, I liked it.<br> But my bosses didn't go for it.<br> Stupid sons of bitches.<br> - You didn't watch the tape.<br> - What? Of course I did.<br> Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me? - I'm not lying to you.<br> I watched it.<br> - You lied again.<br> - I watched it.<br> - Keep going, Pinocchio.<br> - I did.<br> - No, you didn't.<br> I'm telling you, I watched the tape.<br> - Did you watch the tape? - No.<br> The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists.<br> The decision will be based on the answers you give to the questions I ask.<br> We'll start with Dr.<br> Li.<br> You claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system.<br> How do you propose to correct this? I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence.<br> - I plan to begin there.<br> - Interesting.<br> I guess.<br> Dr.<br> Biely, your proposal includes some fieldwork.<br> Where might that take place? Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.<br> Certainly.<br> Very well.<br> And Dr.<br> Geller, when is my birthday? What? l Care to venture a guess? - May 12? - That's not even kind of close.<br> Dr.<br> Li, how many graduate students will you need? - Half a dozen.<br> - I see.<br> And Dr.<br> Biely? Three for excavation, and two for analysis.<br> Certainly.<br> Dr.<br> Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British Invasion band? What? I need six graduate students.<br> No, I'm sorry.<br> We were looking for "Baby It's You.<br>" "Baby It's You.<br>" What? Wait just a minute.<br> None of my questions have anything to do with paleontology.<br> You're right, I apologize.<br> Scratch the last question.<br> Spell "Boscodictiasaur.<br>" I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur.<br>" Yeah, I just made it up.<br> Spell it.<br> - Okay.<br> B-O - No, it starts with a silent M.<br> Oh, come on! I can't believe Joey.<br> I hate being called a liar.<br> But you are a liar.<br> What did I just say? - Are you still here? - Yes.<br> And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted.<br> When I tell somebody I did something Okay, hold on, let me just stop you right there, okay? First, you lied.<br> Right? Then you lied about lying, okay? Then you lied about lying about lying, okay? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about lying Stop lying.<br> Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape? You wanna know why? You wanna know why? Well, this is going well.<br> Here's how I know.<br> If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you'd have some comments.<br> All right, remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.<br> Ichiban.<br> Ichiban, lipstick for men.<br> Ichiban, lipstick for men.<br> And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape.<br> He really is a chameleon.<br> Well, Gladys, say hello to your new home.<br> - Oh, my.<br> - Wow.<br> Oh, she is so nice and big.<br> Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys, oh, so proudly? - I haven't really settled on a spot yet.<br> - How about right above the TV? That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door.<br> Yeah, yeah, and you can get rid of that French poster.<br> - I like that poster.<br> - Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it.<br> Or maybe there's someplace for her in your bedroom? - There's nothing above your bed.<br> - Are you still here? Oh, hi.<br> Hello.<br> Have you come to ask me some more paleontology-related questions? Your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? Ann-Margaret's pant size? I've come here to apologize.<br> I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.<br> No.<br> Stop! Anyway, I decided to offer you the grant.<br> - Really? - There is just one small stipulation.<br> - I have to break up with Charlie? - Hey, you got one right.<br> - You're crazy.<br> - Crazy or romantic? Crazy.<br> - Or? - Get out! Oh, my God.<br> - What? - Joey, what is this thing doing here? I got her from Monica.<br> She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.<br> - Joey, we're not keeping this.<br> - But it's an original Buffay.<br> All right, fine.<br> You can keep it.<br> As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.<br> Hey, what? What? Well, legend has it, Joey, that she comes alive when you're asleep.<br> She climbs out of the frame and then drags her half-a-body across the floor just looking for legs to steal.<br> And then with her one good hand she slowly reaches up and turns your doorknob.<br> Get that legless witch out of here! - Hey, I sold that to Joey.<br> - Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.<br> - Two can play at this game.<br> - Too late.<br> You can't give it back.<br> - Oh, yes, I can.<br> - No, you can't, she's yours.<br> - She's yours.<br> - She's yours.<br> - She's yours.<br> - Hey.<br> - She's mine.<br> - She's mine.<br> - She's mine.<br> - She's mine.<br> You guys, you don't have to fight over her anymore.<br> Whoever doesn't get Gladys, gets Glynnis.<br> - I want Gladys.<br> - She's mine.<br> - She's mine.<br> - She's mine.<br> Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape.<br> And I promise next time to submit you, whether I think you're right or not.<br> That's not the point, Chandler.<br> The point is that you lied.<br> I know.<br> You're right.<br> What's it gonna take for you to forgive me? Oh, my God.<br> Excellent.<br> Now what do you say? Lying is wrong.<br> And? And?! I'm a pretty little girl.<br> I knew it.<br> Your ex-boyfriend is insane.<br> - Did you get the grant? - No.<br> And you wanna know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.<br> What? He refused me because I wouldn't give you up.<br> Benji isn't in love with me.<br> I mean, he broke up with me.<br> - And besides, he's a very ethical man.<br> - Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review: "Who was the voice of Underdog?" I'm sure he was just joking.<br> If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him.<br> I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.<br> - Seriously? - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> No, he did ask me one: "How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?" Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O Damn it.<br> Dr.<br> Geller.<br> Charlie, what are you doing here? I want you to tell her everything.<br> About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you Wally Cox.<br> That's the voice of Underdog.<br> Like I tried to tell you in the interview this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.<br> No, don't do that.<br> I want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth.<br> Benji? It's true.<br> I behaved horribly, but it's only because I still love you.<br> And I would do anything to have you back in my life.<br> Too little, too late, Benji.<br> - I can't believe this.<br> - I never should've broken up with you.<br> I think about you all the time.<br> Do you ever still think about me? No.<br> - Yes.<br> - What? I don't know what to say, Benji.<br> This is all so romantic.<br> Or? I know I may be way out of bounds here but is there any chance you would take me back? Maybe.<br> Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.<br> Oh, God.<br> I am so sorry, but I mean, there's so much history between us, you know? I'm sorry too.<br> - I love you.<br> - I love you too.<br> Okay, that's it, we are seeing other people.<br> Gladys? For the third time this week.<br> Man, this does not get old.<br> - You're mean! - Oh, don't be such a baby.<br> Please.<br>   <br>
