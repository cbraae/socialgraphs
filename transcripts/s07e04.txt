This is one star whose hoop-- This is the star the hoop-- This hoop-- I was Doctor Drake Ramoray! Hi, Tag.<br> What are you doing here? I came to thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday.<br> I noticed there were no plants so I brought you your first.<br> There is a plant in your office.<br> Kind of.<br> Right.<br> So I guess I shouldn't put "good at noticing stuff" on my rÃ©sumÃ©.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Anyway.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm guessing you hired somebody.<br> Well.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Gotcha.<br> Thanks again for meeting with me.<br> But I hired you.<br> -What? -Yeah, you got the job.<br> -You're my new assistant.<br> -I am? Yeah.<br> -I can't believe it.<br> -Me either.<br> First, I need you to go downstairs.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>find a woman named Hilda, and tell her to go home.<br> -Hey.<br> -Hey, good you're home.<br> Always nicer to hear than, "Oh, crap, you again.<br> " Hey, sweetie, I made you a surprise.<br> -Oh, yeah? -Yeah, tacos.<br> Ever since that story, I've had such a craving.<br> Did you not understand the story? -Hey.<br> -Hey, what's up? Nothing.<br> Just figuring out what to do for dinner.<br> Hey, what's that? Dinner stuff? You making dinner? No.<br> What's over there? Tacos? No.<br> No.<br> They're just ground beef smileys.<br> Those are tacos.<br> Excuse me, Mr.<br> Mexico.<br> Either way, I'll pass.<br> Still can't eat those.<br> What's so funny? I'm not laughing.<br> You told her! Nancy Thompson's getting fired.<br> Okay, okay.<br> I had food poisoning.<br> It's not like I chose to do it! It's not like I said, "What would make this ride more fun?" Right.<br> You're right, I'm sorry.<br> I shouldn't be laughing.<br> I should be laying down papers for you.<br> -How could you? -I had to.<br> We're getting married.<br> Married couples can't keep secrets.<br> I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.<br> Dude! -What happened? -Chandler and I are in a bar.<br> .<br> .<br> Did you not hear me say, "Dude"? .<br> .<br> .<br>and this girl is making eyes at Chandler.<br> So he goes over to her and, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.<br> You're thinking he's not the type to go to bars and make out with girls.<br> And you're right.<br> He's not the type.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to go to bars and make out with girls.<br> You kissed a guy? Oh, my God! In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.<br> Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard-- So hard we had to throw out your underwear again? Whatever, dude.<br> You kissed a guy.<br> -Hi.<br> -Hey.<br> How's Hilda working out? Oh, my new assistant is working out.<br> Yes.<br> She happy she got the job? My new assistant is very happy that I hired my new assistant.<br> Hello.<br> Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second? It's the producers at Mac and Cheese, if you'll excuse me for a minute.<br> Hey, funny you should call.<br> I was just looking over next week's script.<br> Canceled! Like, they're taking it off the air? All right, I'll see you Monday.<br> We're not even shooting them anymore? All right.<br> Bye.<br> They canceled Mac and Cheese! -Sorry.<br> -Sorry, Joey.<br> Why would they do that? It was a good show, right? You want to tell secrets? Okay, in college.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Ross used to wear leg warmers.<br> All right, Chandler entered a Vanilla lce look-alike contest and won.<br> Ross came in fourth and cried! Oh, is that funny? You find that funny? Maybe Chandler should know your secrets too.<br> I already told him everything.<br> You shush! Once, she was sent to bed without dinner.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.<br> Ross stayed home every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls.<br> Monica couldn't tell time until she was 1 3.<br> It's hard for some people! Of course it is.<br> Wow.<br> -Chandler wore my underwear to work! -Hey! I'm sorry, I couldn't think of any more for Ross.<br> In college, Chandler got drunk.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm.<br> That was you.<br> Whatever, dude.<br> You kissed a guy.<br> How could this happen to me? Yesterday, I had two TV shows.<br> Today, I got nothing.<br> Wait a minute, what happened to Days of our Lives? Well, they might be a little mad at me over there.<br> What happened? Well, maybe I got a little upset, and maybe I told them where they could go.<br> Joey, why would you do that? Because! They wanted me to audition.<br> You, an actor? That's madness! Rachel Green's office.<br> Tag.<br> Hi, who was that? Nobody.<br> I was just practicing.<br> Really? -Hi.<br> -Hi, Rachel Green's office.<br> You must be Hilda.<br> He's Tag.<br> This is Phoebe.<br> Phoebe, can I see you for a sec? Phoebe.<br> -Great name.<br> -You like that? -You should hear my phone number.<br> -Okay.<br> So you hired yourself a little treat, did you? I know how it looks, but I am telling you-- You can't get involved with your assistant.<br> I know that, and I know hiring him was not the smartest thing I've ever done.<br> But, from now on, I swear this is strictly professional.<br> -Yes.<br> -Hey, Rachel.<br> Hi.<br> Cute assistant.<br> What's his story? -Is he-- -Gay? Yeah.<br> Hey, Terry.<br> Joey Tribbiani.<br> Surprised your big head could fit through our small halls.<br> -I gotta go, Joey.<br> -Wait, Terry! Look.<br> I'm really sorry about before.<br> I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big to audition for you.<br> -Give me another chance.<br> -I can't.<br> Wait, Terry, please! Look, I just lost my other job, okay? You have no idea how much I need this.<br> Please, help me out.<br> For old times' sake.<br> This guy's been in a coma for five years.<br> It's hopeless.<br> It's not.<br> Dr.<br> Stryker Ramoray is a miracle worker.<br> Here he comes.<br> Good morning.<br> Drake, it's your brother, Stryker.<br> Can you hear me? And cut.<br> I'm back, baby! You know, in my defense.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.<br> And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me.<br> -Do you have trouble telling time now? -No.<br> -Quick, what time is it? -Time to kiss a guy? What are you laughing at, Pampers? You know when I said married people.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>should share everything and not have any secrets? -Yeah? -That was stupid.<br> Let's not do that.<br> Absolutely.<br> We should keep the stuff we told each other secret from everyone else.<br> Yeah, definitely.<br> Okay.<br> If you'll excuse me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm gonna hang out with people who don't know the Space Mountain story.<br> -Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe.<br> -Man! Not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with the guys at my office.<br> Hi.<br> -Do you have a minute? -Sure.<br> What's up? I got asked out twice today while I was at lunch.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>by guys.<br> -Really? -Yeah.<br> Did you tell someone that I was gay? Oh, did you not want people to know that? I'm not gay.<br> I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.<br> Why is that? -I don't think I should say.<br> -Oh, you can say.<br> Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.<br> -Okay.<br> -Okay.<br> -Well.<br> .<br> .<br> -Yeah.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.<br> Yeah, she's gay.<br>   <br>
