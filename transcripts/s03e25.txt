                    			So your first sexual experience was with a woman? I was 1 5.<br> It was my best friend, Ruth.<br> And we got drunk on that hard cider.<br> And then suddenly, we were making out.<br> Tell it again.<br> Seriously.<br> Can that woman talk about anything else but sex? Yeah, sure.<br> Earlier she was talking about geography.<br> She was listing the countries she's done it in.<br> I think we all learned something.<br> Hey, you guys! Look what I found! That's my mom's writing.<br> Look.<br> "Me and Frank and Phoebe, graduation, 1 965.<br> " -Do you know what that means? -That you're actually 50? That's not "me" Phoebe.<br> That's her pal, Phoebe.<br> According to her yearbook, they were BFF.<br> Best Friends Forever.<br> That's great! I know! She probably has all kinds of stories about my parents.<br> She might know where my dad is.<br> I looked her up.<br> She lives by the beach.<br> Maybe this weekend we can go there.<br> -Shoot, I can't go.<br> I have to work.<br> -That's too bad.<br> Big fat bummer.<br> So tomorrow we'll drive out to Montauk.<br> Hey, Bonnie had sex there! The One At the Beach .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) Would you look at them? I'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.<br> I'm gonna die an old maid.<br> You're not gonna die an old maid.<br> Maybe an old spinster cook.<br> -Thanks.<br> -Besides, worse comes to worse.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'll be your boyfriend.<br> Yeah, right.<br> Why is that so funny? You made a joke, right? So I laughed.<br> A little too hard.<br> Am I not boyfriend material? You're Chandler.<br> You know.<br> Chandler! Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me.<br> But say we weren't friends.<br> Say it's a blind date.<br> I show up at your door and I'm, like, "Hey, nice to meet you.<br> " I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.<br> Oh, good.<br> You bought food.<br> No, just my luggage.<br> I am having the best karma this week.<br> I find this woman who knew my parents.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then my client gives me his beach house.<br> What about that bike messenger you hit? Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.<br> Hey, check out the hat! Wait a minute, I know that hat.<br> I was taken aboard that hat.<br> They did experiments on me.<br> I can't have children! Seriously, where did you get the hat? Ross gave it to me.<br> I think she looks good.<br> Did he buy it for you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or win it for you? Excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm here to tell you hats are back.<br> And this time, they've ganged up and formed one giant super-hat.<br> Go, go, go! Now everybody wants to be under the hat! What's with all this sand? Bob said there might be flood damage.<br> Either that or he has a really big cat.<br> It's kind of an unusual house.<br> It has three beautiful bedrooms and no baths.<br> But, you know, the ocean is right there.<br> Knock, knock, knock.<br> Hang on.<br> Come in, come in.<br> Think about it and call me back.<br> Are you Phoebe Abbott? Surprise, Phoebe Abbott! I'm your best friend's daughter! You're lrwin's daughter? I mean your old best friend.<br> Here.<br> -Lily? From high school? Remember? -Oh, God, Lily.<br> Yes.<br> Of course I remember Lily.<br> Then you must be-- Phoebe, Phoebe.<br> She named me after you, I guess.<br> Wow.<br> Well.<br> Look, there's Frank! Yeah! Yes! Yes, yes! That's my dad.<br> That's Frank! I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.<br> Take it easy.<br> If you want, there's cookies.<br> Or sangria! I could make sangria! Sorry.<br> Cookies are good, thanks.<br> Anyway, I've been looking for my father.<br> -Have you heard from him or seen him? -Oh, no, I'm sorry.<br> I lost track of everybody after high school.<br> Well, so tell me everything about my parents.<br> Everything.<br> Oh, well, you know, we were always together.<br> -The other kids had a nickname for us.<br> -What was it?

She was pretending she hasn't heard from him.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I found this picture.<br> Isn't this what he would look like now? Totally familiar.<br> Why would she lie to you? We're having dinner tomorrow.<br> Maybe she'll tell me then.<br> Maybe she just wanted to give him time.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to buy me presents.<br> I don't know.<br> So you're all bored?

Oh, nothing.<br> I just felt like hanging out and reading.<br> The water was so great.<br> We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.<br> Sorry I missed that.<br> Joey and Chandler sure are funny.<br> I brought back half the beach in my hair.<br> It was easier when I shaved my head.<br> You know, I gotta tell you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I just loved your look when you were bald.<br> Really? I think about shaving it again sometimes.<br> Really? You definitely should do that.<br> You know what? I should do it! You know what? Thank you.<br> You are so cool.<br> Oh, stop.<br> Go on.<br> -Now go shave that head.<br> -All right.<br> What's the matter? She canceled.<br> My namesake canceled on me.<br> She claims she had to go out of town.<br> She's avoiding me.<br> She doesn't want to tell me where my father is.<br> She knows! Pheebs, that sucks.<br> Well, don't "Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.<br> -Where are you going? -She's out of town.<br> Something in her house will tell me where he is.<br> Some people call that "breaking and entering.<br> " Well, are any of those people here? Look, I'll do something nice, okay? I'll fill her ice trays.<br> Good? Hey, everybody! Look what you did! You wanna touch it? No, but it's great.<br> Come on, touch it.<br> You can feel all the bones in your skull.<br> I was having a little chat with Bonnie, and guess what? She brought up who was behind the head-shaving idea.<br> And now, who was it? Oh, that's right.<br> It was you! That was her idea.<br> I just gave her a nudge.<br> She said you gave her the razor.<br> So anyone up for a midnight dip? -No, I'm good.<br> -No, thanks.<br> -Okay, I'll see you in a bit.<br> -Okay, have fun.<br> Come on, see? She doesn't look that bad.<br> You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What were you thinking? I don't know.<br> You balded my girlfriend! All right.<br> Do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else? You're the one who ended it! Because I was mad at you! Not because I stopped loving you! You still love me? You still love me.<br> Yeah, so? You love me.<br> What does this mean? I mean, do you want to get back together? No! Maybe! I don't know.<br> I still can't forgive you for what you did.<br> But sometimes when I'm with you, I just feel so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> What? I just feel.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -I just-- -What? I feel-- No! I don't care! I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice! But I made cards! Good night.<br> I'm going upstairs.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> Wanna play strip poker for practice? My ass! Oh, it's me! It's me! -I didn't wanna make any noise! -Then don't break in! -I'm sorry! -What are you doing here? I came to fill your ice cube tray.<br> What? Okay, look.<br> I took this picture from your fridge.<br> I know that this is my father.<br> This is Frank Buffay, and you were standing next to him! I deserve to know where I came from.<br> So if you can help me find my father, then you should.<br> Otherwise, you're just mean.<br> So just tell me the truth.<br> All right.<br> The man in that picture is Chuck Mangione.<br> My father is Chuck Mangione? That's just Chuck Mangione.<br> I sold him a house last year.<br> And I'm very sorry, but I really don't know where your father is.<br> And that's the truth.<br> But you're right.<br> I think a person should know where they come from.<br> Which is why l.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I'm your mother.<br> I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>felt all floopy, and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You guys are getting back together.<br> She doesn't even know what she wants.<br> Rachel's still mad at me.<br> Then you gotta back away.<br> You don't need that kind of hurt.<br> Take it from a guy who's.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>never had a long-term relationship.<br> I know, but I really want to go up there and finish that kiss.<br> The water is great.<br> You should go in.<br> No, thanks.<br> I just had an M&M.<br> Well, good night.<br> Good night.<br> Don't be too long.<br> Okey-dokey.<br> There is not one hair on that head.<br> It'll grow back, right? And she's really fun, and she's cool.<br> And I'm finally moving on.<br> Getting over Rachel was so-- I'm finally feeling sane.<br> And if I go up there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I kiss her.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> God, I want to kiss her! And it doesn't work out.<br> Do I wanna put myself through that again? Let me get this straight.<br> If you go with Bonnie, you do the smart, healthy thing and move on.<br> Right? And if you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight? Hi there.<br> That's that weird voice again.<br> Let me try it again.<br> You'll wanna date this next guy, I swear! Hi, I'm Dorf!
