                    			Hey! You're not gonna believe this.<br> I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy.<br> They printed it.<br> I didn't know they print jokes.<br> They print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.<br> It's not just about the pictures.<br> Didn't work on Mom, it's not gonna work on us.<br> Check it out.<br> It's the first one.<br> Right there.<br> That is funny.<br> It was also funny when I made it up.<br> -What? -I made that joke up.<br> No, you didn't.<br> I did.<br> Yes, I did.<br> I told Dan and he said it was the funniest he'd joke ever heard.<br> Hey, tell Dan thanks.<br> What? I was just reading the joke below it.<br> Man, that one is funny.<br> Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right? -No.<br> -Seriously? You tell a lot of jokes.<br> Look, it's my joke.<br> But if it makes you feel better, they don't print the name.<br> So it doesn't really matter who gets credit.<br> Yeah, I guess.<br> -Hey, guys.<br> -Playboy printed my joke! No, it's mine! Call them! They'll tell you! -My joke! -My joke! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jokes? What.<br> .<br> .<br>? You know there's naked chicks in there, right? The One With The Joke Gelula/SDI Dude! You have got to turn on Behind The Music.<br> The band Heart is having a tough time and they may break up.<br> Let's watch that at your place.<br> Monica's watching a show.<br> I don't want to miss when they were skinny.<br> Hey, Chandler? You know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.<br> What? No, I want to watch this.<br> -Did your cable go out? -No.<br> No, that's VH1 .<br> I tell you, the music these kids listen to today.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it's a lot of noise to me.<br> Why is your cable out? Oh, because I haven't really paid the bill.<br> If you need money, would you please let me loan you some? No, Chandler.<br> Forget about it, okay? I know things have been tight since Janine moved out.<br> God, was she hot.<br> I know, yeah.<br> Look, I can handle it, all right? I can listen to the radio.<br> And Ross gave me this great book.<br> Want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch at his place? Sure.<br> -Paid your phone bill? -No.<br> It's only you.<br> -What are you doing? -Looking at a Playboy.<br> I want to look too! Yikes! Do you think these pictures are trying to tell a story? Sure.<br> Like in the case of this young woman.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she has lost her clothes.<br> So she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, "Where are they?" She's not gonna find them, lying in the grass like that.<br> Remember the days when you'd go out to the barn.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Iift up your shirt and bend over? You see, now, I would date this girl.<br> She's cute, she's outdoorsy.<br> And she knows how to build a fire.<br> That'll come in handy.<br> I got a question.<br> If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be? -I don't know.<br> -Me neither.<br> Rachel.<br> What? I don't know.<br> Me neither.<br> You know, you forget how many great songs Heart had.<br> "Barracuda" was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.<br> So you heard it, you repeated it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so that must mean you wrote it.<br> You guys with this joke.<br> Well, I gotta say.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.<br> What? You didn't get it? The doctor is a monkey.<br> And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.<br> You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.<br> Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree.<br> Which is why he sent me a check.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>for $1 00.<br> So you stole my joke and you stole my money? I was gonna stick it in the ATM.<br> But now I think I'll show the sexy teller.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I am a published writer.<br> She'll know that you stole the joke.<br> You gonna follow me there? -Yeah.<br> -I'm not gonna go now.<br> Okay.<br> Here you go.<br> Gunther? I can't pay now, because I'm not working.<br> I've had to cut down on some luxuries like.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>paying for stuff, so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Well, if you want, you can work here.<br> I don't know.<br> It's just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> See, I was a regular on a soap opera, you know? And to go from that to this, it's just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> And plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.<br> Okay.<br> But the money's good.<br> Plus, you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.<br> What? Flexible hours.<br> Maybe I could be a waiter.<br> Could I use the phone? She picked Rachel.<br> She tried to back out of it, but it was obvious.<br> She picked Rachel.<br> He took my joke.<br> He just took it.<br> This is wrong.<br> You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.<br> Know who else picked Rachel? Ross.<br> Know what else Ross did? He stole my joke.<br> I'm gonna get a joke journal, you know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.<br> Good idea.<br> Know what's a bad idea? -Picking Rachel.<br> -That's right.<br> Did you hear something? Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain to steal my thoughts.<br> It's coming from the living room.<br> I finished my book.<br> -Hey, you guys.<br> -Hey.<br> Don't you guys look cute.<br> You guys make a cute couple.<br> What are you doing? Just trying to re-create some of the fun that we had at my place.<br> Remember? When you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.<br> -It was kind of funny.<br> -It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me? Fine.<br> The reason I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is just, you know, you're.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>high maintenance.<br> Let's go to lunch! That is completely untrue.<br> You think I'm high maintenance? Prove it.<br> You write out a list, and we'll go through it point by point.<br> No, you're right, you're easygoing.<br> You're just not as easygoing as Rachel.<br> She's just more.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>flexible and mellow.<br> That's all.<br> Well, people are different.<br> Rachel will do whatever you want.<br> You can just walk all over her.<br> What? Are you saying that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.<br> Oh, okay.<br> You're not a pushover.<br> You think I'm a pushover.<br> Well, watch this.<br> You're not invited to lunch! What do you think? Pretty strong, I think.<br> Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.<br> You start working on that list.<br> -I cannot believe her.<br> -I know.<br> Where do you want to eat? -Oh, I love that Japanese place.<br> -I'm sick of Japanese.<br> Not there.<br> Wherever you want to go is cool.<br> Oh, hey, Gunther.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>check this out.<br> Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up.<br> You want anything to drink? I'm heading up there.<br> -I'll take a coffee.<br> Thanks.<br> -Sure.<br> -Coffee? -No.<br> Coffee? I'm going up there.<br> No, thank you.<br> You need anything? I'm heading up there.<br> I'd love ice water.<br> You got it.<br> What are you doing? Just being friendly.<br> You're not supposed to go back there.<br> It's okay.<br> Right? Don't wink at me.<br> And put on your apron.<br> Okay.<br> I don't see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.<br> -Joey, do you work here? -No.<br> -Waiter.<br> -Yeah! What's going on? Why didn't you tell us you work here? It's kind of embarrassing.<br> I mean, I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.<br> It's supposed to go the other direction.<br> So's your apron.<br> You're wearing it like a cape.<br> I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess if I'm hanging out here, I might as well get paid for it.<br> I just feel kind of weird serving you guys, you know? It'll be great.<br> Come on, I did it and it was fine.<br> Why would it be weird? Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee? It doesn't seem that weird.<br> I asked before.<br> You still haven't gotten it.<br> See, now it's weird again.<br> You're gonna make a lot of money.<br> Here's your first tip.<br> Don't eat yellow snow.<br> This is great.<br> Finally, someone I can pass my wisdom to.<br> Let me tell you some things I learned working here.<br> First, the customer is always right.<br> A smile goes a long way.<br> And if anyone is ever rude to you, sneeze muffin.<br> Thanks, Rach.<br> Hey, look, you guys are just terrific, you know? How about clearing out so I can get some new customers? It's all about turnover.<br> Seriously, can I get my coffee? I'm sorry.<br> I'll get it right now.<br> And since you waited, I'll toss in a free muffin.<br> Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.<br> Okay.<br> So, maybe I am a little high maintenance.<br> And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.<br> But you know what you are? We are sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.<br> That's true, I am flaky.<br> So, what, you're just okay with being flaky? Yeah, totally.<br> Then I'm okay with being high maintenance.<br> Yeah.<br> And I am okay with being a pushover.<br> That's great.<br> Good for you guys.<br> -I am not high maintenance! -I am not a pushover! -Who said you were? -You did! I'm flaky.<br> I'll say anything.<br> Hey, Gunther.<br> Can you cover for me? I got an audition.<br> No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.<br> I like your natural color.<br> It's a great part.<br> I'm the lead guy's best friend.<br> I wait for him and save his seat.<br> Listen.<br> "I'm sorry, that seat's saved.<br> " -That's the whole part? -Maybe he's not his best friend.<br> I'll see you.<br> Oh, man.<br> I could totally get that part.<br> "I'm sorry, this seat is taken.<br> " -Excuse me.<br> -No, I didn't mean you.<br> But you believed me? I believed you were saving this seat for someone.<br> So you'd hire me, right? For what? Exactly! All right, everybody listen up! The coffeehouse will be closed for about an hour.<br> What? It's for the kids.<br> Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.<br> It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy.<br> I'm sure you all read about it.<br> -It's my joke.<br> -It's my joke.<br> It's my joke.<br> I don't think we're gonna settle this.<br> Let's have Monica decide.<br> -Hey, Mon! -Get out here! -Monica? -Okay.<br> You have to decide whose joke this is.<br> Why do I have to? You're the only one that can be fair.<br> I can't be.<br> You're my boyfriend.<br> But I'm your brother.<br> We're family.<br> That's the most important thing in the world.<br> Don't try to sway her.<br> I'm your only chance to have a baby.<br> -Okay, let's go.<br> -All right.<br> We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then you decide which one of us is telling the truth.<br> Me.<br> Chandler, you first.<br> I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.<br> -Did I meet him at Christmas? -Can I finish? You want me to pick you? See, I would never snap at you like that.<br> Two babies.<br> -Continue.<br> -Okay.<br> Steve said he had to go to the doctor.<br> And his doctor's name is Dr.<br> Mompey.<br> I said, "Dr.<br> Monkey?" And that is how the whole Dr.<br> Monkey thing came up.<br> Are you kidding? Okay, look, I study evolution.<br> Remember? Evolution.<br> Monkey into man.<br> Plus, I'm a doctor.<br> And.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I had a monkey.<br> I'm Dr.<br> Monkey! I'm not arguing with that.<br> I've heard enough for my decision.<br> -Okay, so what--? -Do tell.<br> You are both idiots.<br> It's not funny.<br> And it's offensive to women.<br> And doctors.<br> And monkeys.<br> You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.<br> You should argue over who gets blamed for inflicting this joke on the world.<br> Now, let it go.<br> The joke sucks.<br> -It's your joke.<br> -It is not.<br> -Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are.<br> -Hi.<br> Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.<br> Why don't you tell them.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>what you told me about me not being high maintenance.<br> Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.<br> Being with her has been like being on a vacation.<br> And what may be perceived as high maintenance.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is merely attention to detail.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>generosity of spirit.<br> Wow.<br> You know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.<br> Really? I've heard better.<br> Wait, he came up with that himself.<br> Tell them.<br> I'm out of words.<br> Should I say it again? Look, I am not high maintenance! I am not.<br> Chandler! You're a little high maintenance.<br> You are on my list! Look, I'm sorry, but you're not-- You're not easygoing, but you're passionate.<br> And that's good.<br> And when you get upset about little things, I think I'm pretty good.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>at making you feel better.<br> That's good too.<br> They say you're high maintenance.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but it's okay, because I like.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>maintaining you.<br> I didn't tell him that.<br> -You're off my list.<br> -I'm off the list.<br> Phoebe? It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.<br> I have the best boyfriend.<br> You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.<br> How'd the audition go? Oh, not good.<br> No.<br> I didn't get the part.<br> And I lost my job here, so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Wow, that is a bad audition.<br> Well, how did you lose your job here? I had the audition.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but Gunther said I had to stay so he could get his hair dyed.<br> So I went anyway, and he fired me.<br> He left work to do a personal errand.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and left you in charge when you've been here two days? That's not right.<br> What are you gonna do? You can't let him get away with that.<br> I won't let him get away with that.<br> I'm gonna say-- I shouldn't say anything.<br> No, I should say something! Gunther? I want you to give Joey his job back.<br> -It's not fair that you have to fire-- -Okay.<br> -What? -He can have his job back.<br> That's right, he can have his job back.<br> Glad we got that all straightened out.<br> There you go, Joey.<br> -Got your job back.<br> -That's great.<br> Thanks.<br> Pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover? -Rach, you're in my seat.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> I never heard who you'd pick to be your girlfriend.<br> -I'd pick you, Phoebe.<br> -Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.<br> Yeah, I kind of thought.<br> -Never.<br> -It would totally be you.<br> If you had to pick one of the other two to go out with.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who would you pick? -No way.<br> -I'm not answering.<br> Joey.<br> No way, I'm not answering that.<br>   <br>
