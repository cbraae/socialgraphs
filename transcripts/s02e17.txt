It makes me want to pee.<br> Yeah, me too.<br> I think that's the challenge.<br> How come Chandler didn't come? It's because he had a thing with the with the thing.<br> Right.<br> I got it.<br> So why don't you show us the rest of your casa? The best part! Come on.<br> Nice toilet.<br> No, no, no.<br> Behind it.<br> -You have a phone in here? -That's right.<br> I have a phone.<br> In here.<br> Joey, promise me something.<br> Never call me from that phone.<br> The One Where Eddie Moves ln Okay, here we go.<br> Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.<br> Someone just got the last piece.<br> Oh, my God! You won't believe this! I have just been discovered.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.<br> Anyway.<br> Don't freak out and say how great this is until I'm done.<br> I just met this producer of this teeny record company who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of "Smelly Cat.<br>" Okay, I told you not to do that yet.<br> And she wants to do a video.<br> I'm not done yet, okay? God! If that goes well, they may even want to make an album.<br> I'm done now.<br> If you care about me, get the pie out of the man's hood.<br> -Get the what? -There's a pie in the hood.<br> Go! What are you doing? I'm sorry.<br> My pie was in your hood.<br> I have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.<br> Damn it, Ross! Get your butt out of the bathroom! Calm down.<br> I'm blow-drying.<br> Blow-drying what? You have no hair.<br> What's going on? Your boyfriend has been in there for an hour! It's like I'm living with him again.<br> He's here when I go to sleep and wake up and when I want to shower.<br> I feel like I'm 16 again.<br> Well, you're not 16.<br> You're both adults now.<br> Get out, you doofus! Or, you know, he's rubber and you're glue.<br> All yours.<br> I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.<br> Shut up! Cut it out! I've never wanted you more.<br> -Lui.<br> Where is Howard? -He went home.<br> He said he might stop by after a shift.<br> He said he tell you he don't feel so good.<br> Hey what time do you get off? I'm not feel too good either.<br> So what do you say, boys? Should I call him? You know what they say: Ask your slippers a question you're going crazy.<br> I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.<br> That's okay.<br> You had a thing.<br> I hear the place looks great.<br> Forget about it.<br> I'm having a ball! How's the apartment? It's terrific.<br> I mean, it's a regular space- -fest! Well, great.<br> Yeah, I just wanted to call and say hey.<br> Well, okay.<br> Was that the oven timer? That's right, my friend.<br> It's time for Baywatch! Can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer? I can't believe they made her lieutenant! You're saying that because you love Yasmine Bleeth.<br> How could anyone not love Yasmine Bleeth? Hey, they're running.<br> See, this is the brilliance of the show.<br> I say always keep them running.<br> All the time running! Run! Run! Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind! But you wanted to live by yourself.<br> I did.<br> I thought it'd be great.<br> I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.<br> But it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you think.<br> Why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back? You really think he'd take me? We had a good talk last night but when I moved out, I hurt him bad.<br> He would definitely want you back.<br> I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.<br> But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night.<br> I mean, it was It was like when we first started living together.<br> I know you don't want to hear this right now  but we've seen him in his new place.<br> And he's happy.<br> He's decorated.<br> Chandler, he has moved on, okay? You have to, too.<br> You'll have to accept the fact that you're just friends now.<br> You're not  roommates anymore.<br> Okay, Phoebe.<br> You ready to try one? Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you? Smelly, smelly, smelly Really bad smelling smelly cat Whoa! Oh, my God! I mean, like, who was that?

You are so good, hi, you are so good.<br> All right.<br> Now everyone knows everyone.<br> Let's try it again.<br> From the top.<br> Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you? Okay, sorry.<br> I'm just not getting that everyone gets  how smelly this cat actually is.<br> Maybe if we could talk about this  because I need to feel that you really care about the cat.<br> We can talk.<br> It's just that this costs $100 a minute to be in here.<br> So the cat stinks, but you love it.<br> Let's go.<br> No, there is no way he was a velociraptor.<br> Look at the cranial ridge, okay? If Dino was a velociraptor, he'd have eaten the Flintstones.<br> Were you taking a nap? I was.<br> Tony, can you hold on? That's the other line.<br> Yeah, she's here, but can she call you back?

Eddie likes it over there.<br> All right, here you go, my friend.<br> Eggs a la Eddie.<br> That's great.<br> What? I thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a la me! I do, but Eddie makes them this way.<br> They're pretty darn good.<br> Will you try some, there are some extra.<br> -No, thanks! -All right.<br> Well, you guys  I'm out of here.<br> See you, pals.<br> See you.<br> -How are you two getting along? -I couldn't be happier.<br> Great.<br> I'm happy for you.<br> All right, that's it! He just comes in here, Mr.<br> Johnny New Eggs with his moving the mail and his "See you, pals.<br>" And now there's no juice! There's no juice for the people who need the juice.<br> I need the juice! There's another carton there.<br> This isn't about juice anymore, all right, man? All right.<br> So what's it about? Eggs! Whose eggs do you like better, his or mine? -Well, I like both eggs equally.<br> -Oh, come on! Nobody likes two eggs equally.<br> I wanna know which one you like better.<br> What's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore.<br> You took your eggs and you left! Did you expect me to never find new eggs? Maybe this is not about the eggs.<br> Maybe it's about the chicken that lay them.<br> What chicken, there is no chicken.<br> I can't talk to you.<br> I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.<br> Tough.<br> We're watching Predators of the Serengeti.<br> Would you guys stop! It's my TV! -Quit it! -Bite me! Monica keeps changing the channel.<br> That's great.<br> Why don't you tell Mommy on me? Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

We could tape Entertainment Tonight.<br> Not that! This! Us! Oh, my God, Ross, it's.<br> You're just.<br> Since you've been here, you're driving me.<br> Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, all right? I just can't stand you being here all the time! Why? Why can't you stand me being here? We're just having fun.<br> Fun? You think this is fun? I thought we were fooling around, like when we were kids.<br> I hated you when we were kids! You hated me when we were kids? I hated you.<br> I loved you in a you're-my-brother- so-l-have-to way  but basically, I hated your guts.<br> Why did you hate me? Because you were mean to me and you teased me and you always got your way.<br> That wasn't fun for you? I can't believe you hated me.<br> But now I love you.<br> And not just because I have to.<br> Really? You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.<br> I can do that.<br> Then I won't have to kill you.<br> So you wanna watch Entertainment Tonight?.<br> Thanks.<br> You know what? If you really wanna watch that Serengeti thing, we can.<br> Listen, you are not going to believe this but that is not me singing on the video.<br> How did you find out? The record company sent this paper for me to sign saying it's okay for someone else to sing for me.<br> That was my first clue.<br> What will you do? I can't work with people who would do this.<br> Sure.<br> I mean, this poor woman.<br> What woman? The voice woman.<br> She has a great voice, but she doesn't have a video.<br> Okay, Pheebs, but what about you? I have a video.<br> Pay attention.<br> This voice woman, she's so talented.<br> But according to the producer people, she doesn't have the right look.<br> She's like one of those animals at the pound who nobody wants because they're not pretty.<br> Or you know, like some old dog who's kind of like stinky and Oh, my God! She's "smelly cat"! That song has so many levels.<br> Hey, Eddie.<br> You wanna play some foosball? No, thanks, man.<br> I'm not really into sports.<br> Yeah, okay.<br> All right.<br> Doesn't matter.<br> Time for Baywatch! You like that show? You don't? It's just pretty people running around on the beach.<br> That's the brilliance of it.<br> The pretty people.<br> And the running.<br> I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.<br> Okay, man.<br> I think of all the friends I've known But when I dial the telephone No one's home All by myself Don't wanna live All by myself Anymore All by myself I'm gonna sort off with a little song called smelly cat.<br> For those of you who wondering this is my real voice.<br> Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you? Everybody! Smelly cat, smelly cat It's not your fault They won't take you to the vet You're obviously not their favorite pet You may not be a bed of roses And you're no friend To those with noses Ross, those are the only lines we have.<br> Back to the chorus!   <br>
