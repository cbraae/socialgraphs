                    			Come on, Joey! I told you everything I knew last night.<br> It's not that big a deal.<br> So they're doing it.<br> I cannot believe you would say that! Sorry.<br> Monica and Chandler are "making love.<br>" No, I mean, come on.<br> This is a huge deal! I need more details.<br> Who initiated the first kiss? I don't know.<br> God, I just can't imagine Chandler being romantic.<br> Is he romantic with her? I don't know.<br> Are they in love? I don't know.<br> You don't know anything.<br> I know one thing.<br> They did it right there.<br> The One With Chandler's Work Laugh Could I have a scone? -Want to hear some good news? -ls somebody else gonna give it to us? Because you certainly don't seem like you have any.<br> No, I do.<br> Someone I know is getting married.<br> Weddings are happy occasions.<br> Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily! Sorry, man.<br> -Here's your scone.<br> -Thanks.<br> Stupid British snack food! Did they teach you that in anger management? You know what might help you deal with it? You two are in the past.<br> You can't be mad about the past.<br> Are you still mad about, you know, the Louisiana Purchase? Nobody's mad about that.<br> Exactly! Because it's in the past.<br> Anybody going to eat that? Look at us all dressed up for the party.<br> What are we celebrating? We had a lot of liquor left over from Christmas.<br> Our friends aren't here.<br> We can be a real couple.<br> We don't have to hide.<br> I know.<br> I can do this.<br> And I can do this.<br> We can't do that.<br> Hey, Bing! Who's the pretty lady, and what is she doing with you? I asked myself that very question, sir.<br> My boss, Doug.<br> -This is Monica.<br> -Hi.<br> -This is my wife, Kara.<br> -Nice to meet you.<br> Did you hear about the new law firm working for us? Dickem, Stickem & Run.<br> Let's go drink our body weight.<br> What was that? That noise you made? Oh, my work laugh.<br> Your work laugh? If you're going to survive this party, come up with one too.<br> All right.<br> Check me out.<br> He says, "$30, Father.<br> Same as in town.<br>" Everybody at work loved you last night.<br> And they like me more just because I was with you.<br> You repaired the damage from when they met Joey.<br> Doug wants to play tennis.<br> He never talks to me outside of work.<br> Except for that time at that strip club.<br> Strip church.<br> -I'll go find a racket.<br> -I thought you had one.<br> I used to, but then Joey thought it'd be fun to go hit rocks at bigger rocks.<br> Do you have a tennis racket? I lent it to Joey, and I've never gotten it back.<br> Good luck with that.<br> What's up? Why are you here? I thought you had inventory.<br> I do, but I decided I'd take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica.<br> You know, I feel like we don't talk anymore.<br> How are you? What is new with you? Not much.<br> Work's good.<br> We don't have to talk about work.<br> Talk about anything.<br> You know what? Let's talk about relationships.<br> What's going on? Nothing.<br> You go.<br> There was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute.<br> But I don't anymore.<br> That's juicy.<br> You know what? I actually do have a lot of work to do.<br> You're sure there's just not anything else? I'm sure.<br> Is there something you want to talk to me about? No! If there was, I wouldn't tell you.<br> Then what happened? You'll get your turn.<br> -Hey, Phoebe.<br> What's going on? -Nothing.<br> This is not over.<br> No, no, no! I was up all night writing this nasty letter to Emily.<br> It was perfect, and now it's all covered in.<br> Actually, thanks! All right! Ready to go to the movies? Actually, I think I'll skip it.<br> Really? I'll read my book.<br> I just want to be alone right now.<br> Sure you don't want to? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.<br> They get mail and stuff.<br> That's okay, Joe.<br> Let's go, Phoebe.<br> Game! I got to tell you, that partner of yours is a real tiger.<br> Are you all right? We'll just get a little sip of water.<br> Am I on fire today or what? Those birds are browned, basted and ready to be carved.<br> Okay, easy, Martina.<br> I think we should let them win the next game.<br> I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.<br> Let them win one.<br> Are you crazy? We own those two.<br> Look at them! He can't even breathe, and she's popping pills.<br> You're not giving them a chance.<br> They have rackets.<br> We'll make this the last game.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Put me out of my misery.<br> Are you sure you never played pro? Please let them win.<br> I'll take it down to 95%, but that's the best I can do.<br> -Missed it! -I got it! Nice shot.<br> I got it! Long! I can't believe you let them win.<br> Well, at least you hid your feelings well about it.<br> I was frustrated.<br> It's my racket.<br> Frustrated with you! If we hadn't lost, they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow.<br> What bothers me is how different you act around them.<br> The throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh the "See you later, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!" Listen, I don't sound like some crazed, drunken pirate.<br> I know you don't, but "work Chandler" does.<br> I don't like work Chandler.<br> The guy's a suck-up.<br> Because you said that I'm not putting out tonight! Something's wrong.<br> My brother doesn't stay out all night.<br> Maybe we should check the trash chute.<br> Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.<br> That's right.<br> He almost could.<br> Which is exactly how I got stuck there.<br> Oh, my God! Where the hell have you been? Just, you know, out.<br> Oh, out! God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there.<br> What were you doing? I went to a bar, and then I just walked around for a while.<br> You walked around all night in the city by yourself? He hooked up! He hooked up.<br> I don't have to answer your questions.<br> I'm a big boy.<br> I can do what I want.<br> He hooked up! Tell us about her! Ross, you left your scarf Hey, you guys.<br> I know what you all are thinking, but Chandler is in Yemen.<br> I'm a young woman.<br> I have needs.<br> I can't wait forever.<br> Yeah, that's what I was thinking.<br> So I'm asking you, please, just take a moment before you judge me.<br> Nobody's judging you.<br> Mr.<br> Right-place-at-the-right-time call me.<br> So I guess you finished your book.<br> Had some time on our hands, did we? I know what you guys are going to say.<br> You two would have very hairy children.<br> I didn't know you'd say that.<br> Ross! Janice? All right.<br> Hold on, hold on.<br> This is Ross.<br> He's our friend.<br> He obviously went crazy.<br> He obviously lost his mind.<br> Look, it's not that crazy.<br> Okay? But it's Janice! I mean, she's Janice! How drunk were you? Janice and I have a lot in common.<br> We've both been divorced.<br> We both have kids.<br> Are you going to see her again? -Don't put ideas in his head! -I will see her.<br> Damn it, Phoebe! I have to tell you something that I've never admitted.<br> In high school, I made out with James even though I knew you liked him.<br> That feels so good to get off my chest.<br> Okay, you go.<br> My turn? What are you talking about? I know about you and Chandler.<br> I overheard you on the phone the other day.<br> You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.<br>" And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said: "You know what your nickname is, Mr.<br> Big.<br>" You're writing yourself a little play there, Rach.<br> Let me know how it turns out.<br> I wouldn't know, because I got so freaked out I hung up the phone.<br> Well, if you had kept listening you would have heard me call him Mister Bigot.<br> Mr.<br> Bigot.<br> He tells the most racist jokes.<br> All right.<br> So that's it.<br> There's nothing going on between you and Chandler? Me and Chandler? Put your $20 down.<br> First one to find the tasty treat wins, okay? All right, let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.<br> And they're off! Get your foot off my contestant! Judge? Judge rules, no violation.<br> It's so weird to say this, but I just had a great date with Janice.<br> -What? -Are you serious? I opened up to her about all the stuff that's been happening to me.<br> I mean, I talked for hours.<br> It is amazing to have someone give you such focused attention.<br> You don't need Janice for that.<br> You've got us.<br> The duck gets the Nutter Butter! That's not a Nutter Butter.<br> That's an old won ton! Judge rules Nutter Butter.<br> Tough call.<br> Seriously, I strongly believe that we should support President Clinton and her husband, Bill.<br> How do you like your coffee? -None for me.<br> -A little sugar.<br> I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.<br> That will sweeten it up.<br> -That laugh doesn't give you a headache? -You get used to it.<br> I don't think that I can.<br> This will be it for me on the work things.<br> I laugh at my boss's jokes.<br> What's the big deal? I'd rather not be with this work-weasel guy when I can be with my boyfriend, who I actually respect.<br> I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.<br> I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.<br> It's not strong enough to defend itself.<br> Hear what I said? What? It's a joke.<br> What's the matter with you? Well, I just didn't think it was funny, sir.<br> Excuse me? -Well, I just -Honey? I just don't think you understood the joke.<br> Really? I mean, it was really funny.<br> I just don't think that you got it.<br> You see, Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.<br> But what Doug did was imply that it was weak physically.<br> -You get it now, honey? -I think I do! -Thank you, Monica.<br> -I thought you could use the help.<br> Coffee in a fight! You mind if I read my comic books in here? Sure.<br> Why? Chandler and Monica are over there.<br> It's kind of hard to concentrate.<br> She just called and said she was going to be working late.<br> She keeps lying to me.<br> That's it! I'm going over there and confronting them right now.<br> Panty raid.<br> All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now? I'm just not very good at this.<br> I'm a terrible liar.<br> I hate having to lie to Rachel.<br> -But we're not ready to tell yet.<br> -I know.<br> Ever since high school, Rachel was the one person that I told everything to.<br> I miss that so much now.<br> She's my best friend.<br> Oh, my God, Rachel! What are you doing here? Well, I actually came over here to borrow this lamp to look at my books.<br> You know, see them a little better.<br> Okay, great.<br> Well, what I was doing in Chandler's room is that I was cleaning it.<br> He pays me to clean it.<br> What a great way to make some extra pocket money.<br> When I said to you earlier that I was at work I'm at my new work.<br> Good enough.<br> Right? I'll go look at my books.<br> Go get back to my new job.<br> Congratulations on your new job! Man, she is really gullible.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Thanks.<br> -Actually, I should get going.<br> -You're sure? I can stay out as late as you want.<br> I told you I'm on sabbatical from work Yes, yes.<br> You did.<br> -Oh, man! -What is wrong now? This isn't what I ordered.<br> Man! Can't anything go right in my life? First, my marriage falls apart, and then I know! You lose your apartment, you lose your job your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee! We need to talk.<br> -Sometimes I feel -No, no, don't.<br> I'm going to talk.<br> I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.<br> You're a very sweet person, Ross.<br> Unfortunately I just don't think I can take another second of you whining! Let me make sure I'm hearing this right.<br> You're ending this with me because I'm too whiny? So you're saying I've become so whiny that l annoy you Janice.<br> Well, yeah! Oh, my God! Will you be okay? I am now.<br> I guess that's two out of three Joey! Dude, we got to talk.<br> I wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else.<br> I hope this isn't too weird, but I had a thing with Janice.<br> You're not mad? Why would I be mad? Because there's certain rules about this kind of stuff.<br> You don't fool around with your friends' ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.<br> I am mad.<br> But you know, I'm going to forgive you.<br> Because that's what friends do.<br> They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said.<br> Thank you.<br> But I want you to remember that I forgave you.<br> I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent-free.<br> All right.<br> And I want you to remember that I gave you twenty-seven dollars.<br> No strings attached! If you can't remember that we should write it down.<br> Let's write it down!   <br>
