Someone who's your best friend but also can make your toes curl.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, I do.<br> I really do.<br> In fact, it's funny.<br> Often, someone you wouldn't think could curl your toes  might just be the one who gets interrupted.<br> How was the movie? -Wonderful! -So good! -Suck fest.<br> -Total chick flick.<br> I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with guns and bombs and buses going really fast! I don't need violence in a movie as long as there's a little nudity.<br> -There was nudity.<br> -I meant female nudity.<br> I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.<br> Hugh! Hugh Grant!

And I will see you tomorrow.<br> You're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.<br> Does Aunt Monica get a say in this? Please, Aunt Monica, please? Unclench.<br> You're not even gonna be here.<br> -I can't believe we're discussing this.<br> -I agree.<br> I'm, like, in disbelief.<br> If it was gonna happen, wouldn't it have happened already?

It's perfect.<br> It'll just be the two of us.<br> She spent all day taking care of my monkey.<br> I can't remember the last time a girl took care of my monkey.<br> Anyway, I figured after work, I'd pick up some wine go over there and try to woo her.<br> Know what you should do? Take her back to the 1 890s when that phrase was last used.<br> If you keep this up, you'll be finished by the weekend.<br> The one in the feathered boa is Dr.<br> Francis.<br> Now, she used to be a man.<br> Look, there's Raven.<br> We hate her.<br> We're glad she's dying.<br> And then What? Marcel! Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You're not supposed to Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey! Oh, God! Sorry, Barry.<br> A little engagement gift.<br> I'm sure you didn't register for that.<br> Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Come on, roll him over! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right, Marcel? Because Marcel? -How could you lose him? -I don't know! We were watching TV, he pooped in Monica's shoe.<br> Wait.<br> He pooped in my shoe? Which one? I don't know.<br> The left one! Which ones? Those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.<br> Why is the air in here so negative? Rachel lost Marcel.<br> Oh, no! How? -He pooped in my shoe.<br> -Which one? The cute black ones I always wear.<br> No, which one? The right or left? Because the left one is lucky.<br> Come on! What am I gonna do? All right.<br> You're a monkey.<br> You're loose in the city.<br> Where do you go? It's his first time out, so he'll do touristy things.<br> I'll go to Cats.<br> You go to the Russian Tea Room.<br> Oh, my God! Come on, you guys! He'll be home any minute.<br> He's gonna kill me! Search the building.<br> Take the first floor.<br> We'll take the rest.<br> What am I gonna do? You stay here and wait by the phone.<br> Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you.<br> Does anybody want to trade? What do you want? Mr.<br> Heckles, have you seen a monkey? I left a Belgian waffle out here.<br> Did you take it? -Why'd you leave it in the hall? -I wasn't ready for it.<br> Have you seen a monkey? I saw Regis Philbin once.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Heckles.<br> You owe me a waffle.<br> He's a black capuchin monkey with a white face with Russian dressing and pickles on the side.<br> Thanks.<br> How did it go today? Oh, great! It went great.<br> Really great.<br> Is that wine? You want some? Oh, I would love some.<br> But let's not drink it here.<br> I'm feeling crazy.<br> You wanna go to Newark? Okay, but before we head off to the murder capital of the Northeast  I kind of wanted to run something by you.<br> You know how we were talking before about relationships, and stuff.<br> -Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this! -Okay, quick and painful.<br> Oh, God! Okay, all right.<br> All right, okay.<br> Please don't hate me.<br> What? You know Marcel? I kind of lost him.<br> I can't believe this.<br> All I asked you to do was keep him in here! I know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's partially my fault.<br> I shouldn't have had you start with a monkey.<br> You should have started with a pencil.<br> I'm doing everything I can.<br> Everyone's looking for him and I got -Who is it? -Animal Control.<br> -I've even got Animal Control.<br> -You called Animal Control? Why? Do you not like them? Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.<br> I'm not allowed to have him.<br> If they find him, they'll take him away.<br> Well, now, see, you never ever told us that.<br> Because I never expected you to invite them to the apartment! Thanks for coming.<br> Somebody called about a monkey? You know, that was a complete misunderstanding.<br> We thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.<br> -Turned out it was a hat.<br> -Cat! We checked, no one's seen Marcel.<br> -My uncle Marcel.<br> -ls that who the monkey's named after? Possession of an illegal exotic is punishable  by two years in prison and confiscation of the animal.<br> Oh, my God! You'd put that poor little creature in jail? Remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first? Yes, but there isn't always time.<br> I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this.<br> Have a seat.<br> We haven't met.<br> I'm Monica Geller.<br> Oh, my God, you are! And you're Rachel Greene! Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in homeroom.<br> Luisa! Oh, my God! Monica! It's Luisa! I went there too! Luisa! From homeroom! You have no idea who I am, do you? -No.<br> -Not at all.<br> Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.<br> Would it have been hard to say, "Morning, Luisa" or "Nice overalls"? Oh, I'm so sorry! It's not so much you.<br> You were fat.<br> You had your own problems.<br> But you.<br> What a bitch! What? You know what? Be that as it may could you help us with the monkey thing, for old times'sake? Go, Bobcats! I could.<br> But I won't.<br> If I find that monkey, he's mine.<br> Sorry.<br> Marcel? Marcel? Hi, can I help you? We're having an emergency, and we were looking for something.<br> -A monkey.<br> -Yes, have you seen any? No, I haven't seen a monkey.<br> Can you fix radiators? Sure! Did you try turning the knob back the other way? -Of course! -Oh.<br> Then, no.<br> -Taste this.<br> Is there too much rum? -Just a second.<br> -Hope you find your monkey.<br> -No, wait! We may not know about radiators  but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu.<br> Aren't we in the middle of something? But these women are very hot, and they need our help.<br> And they're very hot! We can't, all right? We're sorry.<br> You don't know how sorry.<br> We promised to find this monkey.<br> He's this high and answers to the name Marcel.<br> So if we could get pictures of you, it'd help us out.<br> From now on, you don't get to talk to other people.<br> -Oh, my God! -What? Something brushed up against my right leg.<br> Oh, it's okay.<br> It was just my left leg.<br> Look, Phoebe! Oh, Marcel! Come here! Step aside, ladies.<br> -What are you gonna do? -Just a tranquilizer.<br> Run, Marcel, run! Damn! -Are you okay? -I think so.<br> Oh, gosh! We've been all over the neighborhood! He's just gone! -You don't know that.<br> -It's cold, it's dark.<br> He doesn't know the Village! And now I have a broken foot.<br> I have no monkey and a broken foot! Thank you very much! I've said I'm sorry a million times.<br> What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? I'll break it right now.<br> Oh, my God! There, are you happy now? Yeah, now that you kicked the sign  I don't miss Marcel anymore! It's not like I did this on purpose.<br> No, this is just vintage Rachel.<br> Things just sort of happen around you! You're off in "Rachel Land," doing your "Rachel Thing" oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and I don't want to hear it! Forget it, okay? What? Hey, banana man! This is so intense! One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.<br> -What's with Phoebe? -Tranquilizer dart.<br> Hi! Did you order some bananas? -What about it? -Give me my monkey back! -I don't have a monkey.<br> -Then what's with the bananas? Potassium.<br> Okay, where is he? You're wasting your time.<br> What? -What have you done to him? -That's my monkey.<br> That's Patty.<br> Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.<br> Come here, Patty.<br> Come here, Marcel.<br> Come here, Patty.<br> Here, monkey.<br> Here, monkey! Gotcha! -Give me my monkey back! -It's mine.<br> Take this up with the judge.<br> That's not my monkey.<br> The dress is mine.<br> Send it back whenever.<br> All right, I want my monkey! -Oh, come on, Luisa.<br> -Sorry, prom queen.<br> You had to be a bitch in school, instead of fat.<br> In high school, I was prom queen and the homecoming queen and you were also there.<br> But this isn't high school.<br> We're all adults here! Heckles! Can I have this? For the most part.<br> If you take this monkey, I'll lose an important person in my life.<br> You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.<br> You have a chance to be the bigger person here.<br> Take it! No.<br> All right.<br> Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her you shot my friend with a dart! It'll be nice to get this off, won't it? Or we can leave it on.<br> That's fine.<br> With the right pumps, that would be a great little outfit.<br> Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before No, it was my fault.<br> I almost lost your Yeah, but you got him back.<br> You were great.<br> We still have that bottle of wine.<br> Are you in the mood for something grape? -Sure, that would be good.<br> -All right.<br> The neighbors must be vacuuming.<br> Well, as long as we're here and not on the subject.<br> I was thinking about  how mad we got at each other before.<br> And maybe it was partially because of how we -Rachel? -Barry? I can't do it.<br> I can't marry Mindy.<br> I think I'm still in love with you.<br> We have got to start locking that door! Show us! Come on! -lt was such a long time ago.<br> -Okay, fine.<br> All right.<br> This is me in The Sound of Music.<br> See the von Trapp kids? That's because I'm in front of them.<br> Big nun! I thought that was an alp.<br> High school wasn't my favorite time.<br> I loved high school.<br> It was four years of parties, dating and sex and Well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys.<br> Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.<br> Doesn't it seem like a million years ago? My butt cheek is waking up!   <br>
