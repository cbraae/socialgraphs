                    			- Hey, everybody.<br> Happy Thanksgiving.<br> - No, no, no.<br> Are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year? We're playing a game I learned.<br> You have to name all the states in six minutes.<br> What? That's like insanely easy.<br> It's harder than it sounds.<br> You always forget one.<br> Or in some cases, 14.<br> It's stupid and I wasn't playing with people, so technically, I didn't lose.<br> You forgot 14 states? Nobody cares about the Dakotas! Okay, time's up.<br> All right, I got 48.<br> That's not bad.<br> Pheebs? I got tired of naming states, so I listed the types of celery.<br> And I have one, regular celery.<br> So Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in vegetables.<br> Joey? Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.<br> - Wow, how many you got? - Fifty-six.<br> The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs Gelula/SDI Hey, how is New England not a state? They have a sports team.<br> Does South Oregon have a sports team? There you go.<br> Why one extra place setting? You invited your assistant.<br> Oh, right, sorry.<br> Tag's not coming.<br> His girlfriend came into town, so he's with her.<br> Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.<br> I was going to, but then I figured your food is so delicious and perfect you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.<br> You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that since it's so fake, but I still do.<br> Regular celery! I already have that.<br> Done with time to spare.<br> - This may be a new world's record.<br> - I hate to lecture you guys but it's disgraceful that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states.<br> You ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe? Magellan? You got 46 states.<br> - What? That's impossible.<br> - Forty-six.<br> Well, who's well-educated now, Mr.<br> L-Forgot-Ten-States? I'm going to go turn on Joey's oven.<br> Please, watch him.<br> Do not let Joey eat any of the food.<br> I am only one man.<br> - Okay, time is up.<br> - Now, just give me another minute.<br> If you don't know them by now, you never will, okay? That is the beauty of this game.<br> It makes you want to kill yourself.<br> This is crazy.<br> I can do this.<br> All right, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.<br> Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.<br> You're on.<br> Don't look at my list, because there's a lot on there that you don't have.<br> Did you know your oven doesn't work? The drawer full of takeout menus is okay, right? Ross, I'm gonna use yours.<br> Chandler, give me a hand.<br> Joey, do not let Ross look at maps or the globe in your apartment.<br> Don't worry.<br> It's not a globe of the United States.<br> I'm gonna go out and take a walk.<br> Phoebe, why is your bag moving? - Oh, it's not.<br> - Seriously, it's moving.<br> - What the hell's in there? - It's just my knitting.<br> That's all.<br> Yes, I knit this.<br> I'm very good.<br> Ross' apartment is nice.<br> Why don't we hang out here? Maybe because it smells weird.<br> It's like old pumpkins or something.<br> - That's my pie.<br> - Which smells delicious.<br> - Uh-oh.<br> Uh-oh.<br> - What? We left Joey alone with the food.<br> Yep, yep, I knew it.<br> There he is feeding stuffing to a dog! Hi, Geller-Bing residence.<br> How can I help? Why is a dog in our apartment? I'm sorry, who's this? There's a dog sitting on my couch.<br> Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue! - There's no dog here.<br> - There is! He's black and white and shaggy.<br> He's sitting next to Rachel and licking her hand.<br>  Oh, my God! Where are you? I'll be right there.<br> They're here already? How are they doing this?! Hi, Tag.<br> What are you doing here? I wanted to see if your offer was still good.<br> Well, sure.<br> Come in.<br> Well, what happened to your girlfriend? We kind of broke up this morning.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> - Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.<br> Ohio, thank you.<br> Where's the dog? What dog? There's no dog here.<br> Yeah, that dog left.<br> Phoebe.<br> Phoebe, open up.<br> There's no dog in here.<br> Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.<br> No, that's just me coughing.<br> Oh, good.<br> There you are.<br> Listen, I have a dog in my room.<br> What is it doing here? I'm watching it for friends who left town.<br> Wait.<br> Hello, my name is Klunkers.<br> May I please stay with you nice people? I wish he could stay, but Chandler's allergic.<br> Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes my throat will just close up.<br> That's odd.<br> This dog's been living here for the past three days.<br> Really? If he's been here that long without a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to it.<br> It still has to go, right? Why? - Okay, it's - Don't do it! - Don't do what? - I have to.<br> Okay? It's time.<br> Okay, I hate dogs.<br> - What?! - That's crazy? Why? Told you.<br> They are needy jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking and that scares me a little bit.<br> You're right.<br> They are scary.<br> She just ate a treat out of my hand! Wait.<br> Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies? Is there a puppy here? - You don't like puppies? - Okay, you are new.<br> Look, Chandler, I told you.<br> Never tell anyone about this dog thing.<br> It's like Ross not liking ice cream.<br> - You don't like ice cream? - It's too cold! It's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.<br> Hurts my teeth.<br> And I don't want you guys to hate me but I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay? So either the dog goes or I go.<br> Oh, my God! How can I not get this? I'm a college professor.<br> I got 1 450 on my SATs.<br> Twelve fifty.<br> Damn, I forgot you were here.<br> We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.<br> We'll be back soon.<br> Can I ask you a question? When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before making a move? I'd say about a month.<br> Really? I'd say three to four.<br> Half-hour.<br> Interesting.<br> When it's your assistant, I'd say never.<br> All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point.<br> A "moo" point? Yeah.<br> It's like a cow's opinion.<br> It just doesn't matter.<br> It's "moo.<br> " Have I been living with him for too long, or did that make sense? Don't listen to Joey.<br> Okay, would you look at him? He's obviously depressed.<br> He's away from his family.<br> What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.<br> You're right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Thank you.<br> - Okay, that's what I'm going to do.<br> - Fine, take their advice.<br> No one ever listens to me.<br> When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.<br> How you holding up? Not bad.<br> - I'm sorry about your girlfriend.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Were you guys together a long time? - A year, on and off.<br> I thought we'd end up together.<br> I don't anymore.<br> - Now that she broke up with you.<br> - Yeah.<br> It's weird.<br> I used to assume that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy.<br> That all that was just a given.<br> Lately, it's like, what if it's not? Do you ever have that feeling? No.<br> Yeah.<br> All the time.<br> Constantly.<br> It's terrifying.<br> But you know, then I figure it has to work out.<br> Why? Because it has to.<br> - You have all the answers, don't you? - No, no, I do.<br> I really do.<br> - Thanks for talking to me.<br> - Come on, what are bosses for? Hug it out.<br> All right, he likes you back.<br> Told you you should go for it.<br> What? Street noise drown any of that out? No? See you later.<br> Okay.<br> What did Joey say? I like you back? Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back.<br> And you were hugging me so obviously you are not repulsed by it.<br> Yeah! - Wait, that doesn't make any sense.<br> - No? All right, here's the truth.<br> Joey said what he said because I'm attracted to you.<br> Wow.<br> Yeah, I admit it.<br> I have a crush on you.<br> I know that's crazy because we work together and nothing could ever happen.<br> The last thing I wanted to do was freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable.<br> Which is why it would be great if you said something right about now.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Those guys are stealing my car.<br> What? Right there.<br> That's my car! - Hey! - Okay, that'll take one minute.<br> Do you have anything else to say? I can't believe it.<br> We still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.<br> Look, there they go.<br> Okay, Phoebe.<br> We should probably go back now.<br> Please, don't leave me.<br> I'll be lonely.<br> Stop it.<br> Stop.<br> - Okay, let's go.<br> We can be strong.<br> - Yeah, okay.<br> Did you hear that? She said, "Monica.<br> " I can't leave her.<br> We could sneak the dog back and Chandler wouldn't even know.<br> That won't work.<br> I've had that dog for three days, and Chandler had no idea.<br> He's not so smart.<br> Hey.<br> I didn't know either.<br> Yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, didn't you? Yeah, I knew.<br> Where's Chandler? - Here I am.<br> - Wash your hands.<br> How did you know? Hey, what's she doing back here? Relax, Ross.<br> She's not made of ice cream.<br> Hey, look, Phoebe.<br> I laid out the states geographically.<br> We don't have time.<br> We have to keep Chandler away.<br> - Yeah, but, look what - This is what we do not have time for! - Where's Monica? - In Phoebe's room.<br> You can't go in.<br> Why not? Monica's crying.<br> She's very upset about this whole Klunkers thing.<br> - Well, I should go in there.<br> - No, no.<br> No, she doesn't want to see you right now.<br> - Why not? - Because you sent away the dog.<br> - That's ridiculous.<br> - Oh, is it? Is it?! Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover.<br> And one day, my dad decides he doesn't like dogs.<br> So Monica and her friend, Phyllis take away the dog and that was the last time we ever saw him.<br> See? This is just like that only with a few details changed.<br> Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.<br> Bring on the food.<br> - What's the matter? - Monica's upset because of Klunkers.<br> So? Bring the dog back.<br> You're a hero.<br> Yeah, I could be a hero.<br> I could do that.<br> What if it attacks me? Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.<br> And that doesn't scare you? Ross, you need some help? From you? Yes, please.<br> First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up.<br> I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.<br> - Tag still talking to the police? - Yeah.<br> Dammit.<br> Why did I open my mouth? "I have a crush on you.<br> I'm attracted to you.<br> " I know that I freaked him out.<br> If you said it like that, you did.<br> Hey, is Chandler here? No, he went for a walk.<br> Okay, you cannot tell him, but look who's back.<br> Well, no, no, no.<br> He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here.<br> Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there! You think? Hi, honey.<br> Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.<br> - What? Why would? - Wait and see.<br> Maybe we will, maybe we won't.<br> Okay, I went over to Ross' to bring back Klunkers for you and I left the door open, and she must've gotten out.<br> And I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof.<br> Which, FYI, Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed.<br> I couldn't find him and I am so, so, so sorry.<br> But I do know where we can all go ease the pain.<br> We have good news.<br> Look who's back! Klunkers.<br> Oh, my God! - She came back all by herself.<br> - It's a Thanksgiving miracle.<br> It is so good to see you.<br> She came all the way back from Ross'.<br> The things she must've seen.<br> She climbed up the fire escape and tapped on the window with her teeny paw, and we ran to let her in.<br> I went too far, didn't I? When should I have stopped? Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states.<br> Let me tell you something.<br> I have 49 states and there are no more! I think I should be able to eat something.<br> It's up to you.<br> - Oh, hi.<br> How are you doing? - I'm okay.<br> I got to go to the police station and look at mug shots.<br> Thanks for having me over.<br> Tag, you're going? We didn't even get a chance to talk.<br> So where did you say you're from again? - Colorado.<br> - What good are you? Look, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.<br> Okay.<br> I never should've said what I said.<br> It just doesn't matter how I feel.<br> We work together, so nothing could ever happen between us.<br> I would love to go to work on Monday and never talk about this again.<br> Okay.<br> Big day, Monday.<br> Lots to do.<br> So we okay? I'm not.<br> I freaked you out.<br> No, you didn't.<br> What freaked me out was you saying nothing could happen between us.<br> - Really? - Yeah.<br> So please don't fire me for doing this.<br> That's one less thing we have to do on Monday.<br> Delaware.<br> Delaware.<br> - All right.<br> - I want my turkey now.<br> You got it.<br> You got Nevada twice.<br> - I know.<br> - Yeah.<br>   <br>
