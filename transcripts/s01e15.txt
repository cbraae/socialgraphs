Why? What if I came into your office and I started? I can't think of an example.<br> I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes for a tartlet? So I told him, "I'm sorry.<br> That's how I feel.<br>" And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.<br> Then I said, "Don't eat that.<br> It's a kitchen magnet.<br>" And he didn't listen, so we left him in the emergency room.<br> -Mon, I'm sorry.<br> -What a tool.<br> -You did the right thing.<br> -You don't wanna work for that guy.<br> I just thought that this was it.<br> -Don't worry.<br> You're an amazing chef.<br> -Those yummy noises?
