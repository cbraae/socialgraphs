What is the name of your roommate who is very sorry and would do anything? -Damn it, Chandler, stop calling.<br> -Joey, it's Ross.<br> -Sorry.<br> -It's all right.<br> What's up? Not much.<br> I got Chandler here and he's really, really sorry The One with Chandler in a Box Oh, turkey! Giving thanks! Look, everyone.<br> It's the spirit of Thanksgiving! Are things with Joey better? They couldn't be worse.<br> I spent eight hours calling him trying to get him to talk to me.<br> Eight hours.<br> You could probably use a plug-in telephone headset.<br> Should we all expect Christmas gifts that are stolen from your office? You shouldn't.<br> Speaking of Christmas.<br> Since Monica and I are starting a new business and have no money this year we could do Secret Santa and each only buy one gift.<br> And there's the added mystery of who gets who.<br> Who gets whom.<br> I don't know why I do that.<br> But it is correct.<br> Hey, what's this? It's all of your names.<br> Let's pick.<br> Hey, what's going? -No, Joey, stay.<br> -We're picking names for Secret Santa.<br> Okay.<br> I invented Secret Santa, you know.<br> What are you laughing at? You're the one who said Die Hard was your idea.<br> It was.<br> Don't make me show you the napkin.<br> I'm going to take a nap.<br> Turkey makes me sleepy.<br> We haven't eaten yet.<br> I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready and.<br> Did you pick Rachel for your Secret Santa? I'll trade for her.<br> I picked her.<br> Thank God, you want her! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly? She exchanges every gift she gets.<br> It's impossible to get her something she likes.<br> Come on, let's trade! I got her that backpack and she loved it.<br> I remember she cried when that big dog ran off with There was no big dog.<br> This sucks! I already got her a briefcase with "R.<br>G.<br>" put on it.<br> Her initials.<br> Okay, I'm really bad at initials.<br> You got your shopping done early.<br> Yeah, well, my Camel Cash was about to expire.<br> Maybe you can give it to somebody else.<br> Like Ross Geller! You know what? It's a girlie briefcase.<br> Who cares! He works in a museum.<br> The big game's about to start! Ross and Joey aren't here.<br> You can watch the parade if you want.<br> Thanks.<br> What is wrong with this freezer? -What happened? -lce just got in my eye! People are trying to sleep in here! Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts! -Open it up.<br> Let me see.<br> -I can't.<br> It really kills.<br> Maybe you should put some ice on it.<br> -lt looks bad.<br> -We should take you to a doctor.<br> No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend.<br> He's really picky about his patients.<br> You've got to go.<br> What's his office number? Like I remember his office number! Speed dial seven.<br> I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye.<br> Is Richard Burke in today? He's not in.<br> Will she see the on-call doctor? -Yes.<br> -She's very excited about that! Okay, we'll be right in.<br> Okay, so who's gonna take her in? I'll go, you can watch your parade.<br> It's so cool.<br> Till Monica gets back, I'm head chef.<br> And I get to make all the decisions.<br> She told you to follow the recipe exactly.<br> Get out of my kitchen.<br> I think I'm making some progress with Joey.<br> When I walked in, he went to his bedroom but he only slammed the door once.<br> Yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.<br> I've got to call my mom and ask her a left-handed cooking question.<br> I'm gonna be in there.<br> While I'm gone.<br> Chandler, you're in charge.<br> I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.<br> You want to switch? I was trying to trade for you.<br> Really? That's so nice.<br> What are you getting me? I don't know, R.<br>G.<br> I was thinking something girlie for your office.<br> Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.<br> Then you'll get stuck with Rachel, and she exchanges every gift.<br> No, I got her lots of stuff she never took back.<br> Like? Like that gold necklace I got her last year.<br> When did she wear it last? She wore it all Christmas day and then.<br> Big dog? What are you doing? Sending back this stuff Chandler bought.<br> -Even the TV? -No, I'll put that in my room.<br> Listen, Joey.<br> I know what he did was wrong.<br> But can't you hear him out? If Chandler had kissed Rachel, would you hear him out? That's a good point.<br> How long you going to punish him? Five years.<br> You've sentenced him? Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.<br> The guy's your best friend.<br> Was my best friend.<br> I don't know why you're pushing for him.<br> With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.<br> -Who, me? -Yeah.<br> I'm honored.<br> You know what I'm going to do as your best friend? I'm going to get you to talk to Chandler.<br> All right.<br> But if you weren't my best friend.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Is it really that bad? I walk in the room, and he won't talk to me.<br> He just mumbles something in ltalian.<br> And I know he only knows the bad words.<br> I'm so, so sorry.<br> I feel responsible.<br> It's not your fault.<br> -Gunther, have you seen Chandler? -I thought you were Chandler.<br> But one of you is over there.<br> Hey, Joe.<br> I'll be right with you.<br> Thanks for coming in.<br> Oh, my God! How cute is the on-call doctor? So cute that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.<br> -You have the best luck with eye doctors.<br> -I know.<br> Dr.<br> Burke will see you now.<br> Not Dr.<br> Burke.<br> The on-call doctor will see me now.<br> Dr.<br> Richard Burke is out.<br> Dr.<br> Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.<br> Ready? Hey, I'm sorry.<br> That -Where you going? -My folks'.<br> When you coming back? I don't know.<br> I might stay there while I look for an apartment.<br> What? I thought we could talk about this.<br> Work it out.<br> Seeing you two together, I don't.<br> What do you want me to say? Should I stop seeing her? It's not about her.<br> Okay? But seeing you together reminds me of what you did.<br> I won't live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.<br> I know what it is to be a friend.<br> I screwed up.<br> Yeah, you did.<br> And that's why I'm leaving.<br> If you're not going to stay for me, then at least stay for them.<br> They had a very difficult year.<br> What with the robbery and all.<br> And that chick used to be very cute.<br> When that guy was robbing us and I was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours do you know what I was doing? I was thinking about how I let you down.<br> If I knew what kind of friend you'd be, I wouldn't have worried.<br> Wait one second! There has to be something that I can do.<br> If we still had that unit I'd get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.<br> What? We got a box.<br> I remember the last time I saw you.<br> It was the morning I left for college.<br> You were standing outside the Dairy Queen.<br> Just probably waiting for it to open.<br> -You look great now.<br> -You look great too.<br> You're an excellent patient.<br> How does it look? You have a scratch on your cornea.<br> You have to wear a patch.<br> Like a pirate? If that helps you.<br> How long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.<br> I moved back here a couple months ago.<br> Big family dinner tonight? No way! I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.<br> But we broke up.<br> She wasn't ready for a serious commitment.<br> So you made her walk the plank, aye, matey? You're not wearing the patch yet.<br> I know.<br> -He's coming here for Thanksgiving? -I know.<br> It's sick.<br> -Why is it sick? -It's Richard's son! It's like inviting a Greek tragedy over for dinner.<br> If it were Greek, I'd be blind in both eyes.<br> I like him because he's handsome and he's nice and smart and handsome.<br> Phoebe, you understand, don't you? I could see where I'd be your best shot, but no.<br> Sorry, honey.<br> I think it's twisted.<br> -What's twisted? -Me going out with Richard's son.<br> It sounds like a really bad idea to me.<br> -ls he okay in there? -He's fine! If things work out between you and Richard's son you can tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather.<br> Judge all you want to.<br> Married a lesbian, left a man at the altar Ioved a gay ice dancer threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire, live in a box! What exactly is the point of the box? The meaning of the box is threefold.<br> One, it gives me the time to think about what I did.<br> Two, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey.<br> And three it hurts.<br> And if he stays in the box you guys will be friends again? Let's just say it's a start.<br> Remember that necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it? Why? I just want to check something.<br> Okay.<br> Now we'll see.<br> Air hole! Air hole! Here it is.<br> I love it.<br> I wear it all the time.<br> The necklace I got you was gold.<br> This is silver.<br> Well, maybe it changed.<br> Oh, my God! You actually exchanged it.<br> Isn't it better to exchange it for something I enjoy and can use a lot? What did you get? Credit.<br> I'll get it.<br> I'll get it.<br> I'll get it.<br> I'll get it.<br> I'll get it.<br> Hi, Tim.<br> Thank you.<br> Come meet my friends.<br> Phoebe.<br> And Joey.<br> My brother, Ross.<br> And Rachel.<br> That's Chandler.<br> How do you do? -What's? -Well, he's.<br> He's doing some thinking.<br> -What happened? -You kissed my girlfriend! I like those sunglasses.<br> "Like them" like them? Or "I'd like to get store credit" like them? This turkey is ready.<br> Where can I wash up? Let me show you.<br> The towels are hanging next to the sink.<br> -And you can use the fancy soap.<br> -Thank you.<br> Fancy soap? I thought we were saving that for the pope.<br> See.<br> He's nice, right? Do you want a relationship where you can actually say: "That's not how your dad used to do it"? Everything looks great.<br> Where should I sit? Saved you a seat.<br> Sick, sick, sick, sick.<br> I'll get it.<br> Got you! That doesn't sound like thinking to me.<br> -Sorry! -You shouldn't be talking at all.<br> You've got too much thinking to do to be talking and joking.<br> Okay, you got it! Ross, pass me the yams? Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.<br> Will you stop! What's the matter with you? We've got company.<br> Nothing's the matter with me.<br> I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.<br> I have feelings.<br> Okay, fine.<br> You can't tell, but I'm breaking the tension by mooning you guys.<br> All right, look! If this is a big joke to you, forget about it.<br> This means something to me.<br> If it doesn't mean anything to you, then get out of there.<br> Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.<br> You're right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> This means a lot to me.<br> I want to be friends again.<br> I swear I won't say another word.<br> -So you'll take this seriously? -Absolutely! That sounds like another word to me.<br> Are you going to take this seriously? Okay! Don't say that I have no sentiment.<br> This is a movie stub from our first date.<br> This eggshell is from the first time you made me breakfast in bed.<br> This is from the museum, the first time we were together.<br> Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Though you're not supposed to take these.<br> It's, like, a million years old.<br> We actually have people looking for that.<br> -Mind if I smoke? -Care if I die? No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.<br> Go ahead, smoke.<br> This always happens.<br> Here, let me.<br> Thank you.<br> You have very beautiful eye.<br> My friends think this is weird.<br> Even the one in the box? It's not weird, is it? I thought it would be.<br> I almost canceled, but it really isn't.<br> I know.<br> Me and your dad, that's totally separate.<br> I totally agree.<br> We're two people who find each other very attractive.<br> Right? -What? -Nothing, nothing.<br> No, really.<br> Was that not okay? No, that was good.<br> That was a good kiss.<br> -lt reminded you of -Don't say it! -lt did, didn't it? -Yes! I know! God, I am sorry.<br> I am so sorry.<br> It's okay.<br> It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without a little emotional scarring.<br> You know what's even worse? My friends were right.<br> You know what's worst for me is you remind me of a younger version of my mom.<br> -I want you to know how sorry I am -It's okay.<br> -Chandler's the one I'm mad at.<br> -Well, I'm still sorry.<br> -ls he here? -ln the box.<br> He can't talk right now.<br> Why not? What's going on? He's trying to show Joey how much he means to him.<br> -By being in a box? -Joey had reasons.<br> They were threefold.<br> You not being able to talk might make this easier.<br> Listen.<br> I don't want to be someone who comes between two best friends.<br> I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys.<br> And I don't want to be the cause of that.<br> I don't think we can see each other anymore.<br> I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.<br> I'm going to stay there for a while.<br> I think this could have been something really amazing.<br> But, you know, this is probably for the best.<br> You know? I'm going to miss you.<br> Goodbye, Chandler.<br> Open the box! What? He can still catch her.<br> Get out of there! Get out of there! We're going to be fine.<br> Get out! You did some real good thinking in there.<br> I mean, this is.<br> You could still catch her! And merry Christmas from your Secret Santa! All right, who got Chandler? Because I need to trade.<br> He sees her! He's catching up to her.<br> She sees him! They're hugging! He's taking her purse.<br> That's not them.<br> I'll go call the police.<br> There they are! All right, get a room.<br>   <br>
