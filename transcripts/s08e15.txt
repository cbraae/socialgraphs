                    			- Oh! Hey, Rach! - Hi.<br> - Happy Valentine's Day! - You too! How's living at Ross'? It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long.<br> Something really boring happened to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> I'll see you guys later.<br> That is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.<br> I wish you'd get over her.<br> I hate seeing you like this.<br> Is there anything I can do for you? Do you wanna look down my top? Thanks.<br> Maybe later.<br> - Gunther, can I get a scone? - Want anything? I want a lot of things.<br> I wanna be with the woman I love! I want her to love me back.<br> And I want relief from the wrenching pain of knowing that won't happen! We have red bagels.<br> Okay.<br> The One With The Birthing Video mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 How does Mona feel about Rachel moving in? I'm on my way to tell her.<br> She's been away all week, but she'll be cool.<br> She's been so supportive.<br> She even got the baby a T-shirt that says "Fossils are my friends.<br>" Come on, Mona.<br> Don't kiss ass.<br> So I'm gonna take off.<br> Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot! Rachel wanted to see this tape.<br> - What is it? - My friend giving birth.<br> Could you take it to your apartment? "Candy and Cookie"? Candy's the mom, Cookie's the daughter.<br> The father's name is also Cookie.<br> Why am I friends with these people? I wanna show you something in the bathroom.<br> Monica, grow up.<br> - What's behind your back? - Something I want Phoebe's opinion on.<br> - You don't want my opinion? - Not really.<br> Come on, I'm your older brother.<br> Ask me.<br> Okay, big brother.<br> Which one would make your best friend want to do your little sister? The red one.<br> Hey.<br> I know you're depressed, so I brought someone to cheer you up.<br> Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate.<br> I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.<br> Hey, a dog! Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane.<br> He's the happiest dog ever.<br> I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.<br> So you can keep him till he cheers you up.<br> Thanks so much, Pheebs.<br> We are gonna have so much fun! Oh, not that kind of fun.<br> Happy Valentine's! I'm slipping into something a bit less comfortable and a bit more slutty.<br> "Candy and Cookie"? "Candy and Cookie"?! Monica got me porn? Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me! "- Yeah", "just relax.<br>" - I love you, St.<br> Valentine.<br> Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.<br> Now push! "Oh", "God", "it hurts!" Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! "- Oh", "make it stop!" - I am trying! Get the ball.<br> Ready? Get the ball! You're cute, but you're not too smart.<br> Did I just throw this? - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> I accidentally packed these with my stuff.<br> - Who is this? - Phoebe's friend's dog.<br> I don't know his real name.<br> I call him Mozzarella.<br> You are so cute.<br> I wish I could play, but I've gotta go to work.<br> I hope I stop talking like this before my meeting.<br> Yes, I do.<br> Bye-bye, Joey.<br> Seriously, I can't stop it.<br> Come here! Hey! That's Rachel.<br> She used to live here.<br> Might as well be honest with you.<br> We love her.<br> But we can't have her.<br> I really miss her.<br> Hey, you understand, right? You're a guy.<br> Well, you used to be.<br> So, what do you think? I've still got it.<br> - Why did you get me this? - What is it? It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.<br> Oh, the dilating! Is this the video of the birth? It's Phoebe's.<br> Why were you watching it? I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentine's Day.<br> If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day you were right.<br> It's about a girl who moves to the city in search of stardom but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.<br> It got four stars.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Those aren't stars.<br> - Anyway, you wanna take a look? - Well - I'm not really in a sexy mood.<br> - Hey, what's going on? Remember the first time you saw "Jaws" how long it took to go back in the water? We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.<br> - You don't know.<br> You didn't see it.<br> - Childbirth is beautiful.<br> Oh, beautiful? Really? You think this is beautiful? Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me! - See, honey, there's - Don't touch me! - Hi! - Hey! - How was Atlantic City? - Good.<br> I brought you back a present.<br> You didn't have to Saltwater taffy?! Thanks.<br> Interestingly, it isn't made with seawater.<br> It's actually made with salted fresh water.<br> That's not interesting.<br> - I think it's interesting.<br> - Me too.<br> I missed you! - How was your week? - Good.<br> - The baby started kicking.<br> - How exciting! It was amazing.<br> The only thing is, I wasn't there the first time.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - I was missing out on all this stuff.<br> - Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> - What? - Joey cracks me up.<br> "Have your ex-wife move in.<br> That wouldn't be awkward.<br>" Lmagine, I go away for a few days and my boyfriend is living with a woman he got pregnant.<br> So, what'd you tell him? You didn't tell Mona Rachel moved in? She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.<br> Plus, she got me taffy.<br> - Really? I've never had any.<br> - Ever? My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.<br> Thank you.<br> Are you gonna tell her? I will.<br> I want to butter her up first.<br> I'm gonna take her to dinner, do all this romantic stuff.<br> When she thinks I'm the best boyfriend ever I'll tell her my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.<br> If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady.<br> So where are? What the crap is up with this stuff? Is it gum? Is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice.<br> May I try a pink one? So between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross it just isn't gonna happen.<br> It'd be like you falling in love with a cat.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued.<br> - Did you give him a beer? - No.<br> - Will you excuse us? We need to talk.<br> - Sure.<br> Oh, me, right.<br> - He's miserable.<br> What happened to him? - Nothing.<br> - We talked about stuff.<br> - What stuff? Rachel stuff.<br> Oh, Joey, you bummed him out! This is the happiest dog in the world.<br> He spends a day with you, and look! He's breathing.<br> - I'll take him to Wendy's.<br> - He's fine.<br> Look.<br> Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! God, what have I done to you? I broke the dog, Pheebs! I broke the dog! I'm going to pick up Mona.<br> What are you doing tonight? Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans.<br> I've got Chinese food on the way, and your saltwater taffy.<br> Interestingly, it isn't made with seawater We actually watched the documentary together.<br> Oh, my Chinese food.<br> I'll get my cash.<br> Mona? What are? Hi! How are you? I'm supposed to pick you up.<br> I made you a Valentine's dinner.<br> Surprise! - Oh! Hey, Mona! - Hi, Rachel.<br> What's she doing here? I have no idea.<br> I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.<br> What is she doing? Lately she just likes hanging out here.<br> - Why? - I think she's lonely.<br> But it's Valentine's Day.<br> Can't we ask her to go? Well, no, she's way too emotional.<br> And by emotional, I mean crazy! That's just my Chinese food.<br> She has food delivered here? Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.<br> I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.<br> And you thought she was gonna be in our way! Open the champagne, and I will be right back.<br> - I've got a surprise.<br> - You got another ex-wife back there? Please start drinking.<br> - I'm just gonna grab the phone.<br> - Rachel, wait.<br> I hope you don't take this the wrong way.<br> - What are you doing? - Do you need the phone? No.<br> Ross is too nice to say it, but this is his apartment.<br> We need boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place? But, Mona, I live here.<br> Happy Valentine's Day! Or, something to remember me by.<br> - How long has it been this time? - Ninety seconds.<br> Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.<br> Except all I did was think about it.<br> I know.<br> It haunts me.<br> Till now, the worst thing I'd seen was my dad doing shots off the houseboy.<br> After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver.<br> We have to get past this.<br> We'll pretend it never existed.<br> I could do that.<br> Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.<br> - Oh, thank God! - I know.<br> Come in! Hi.<br> I'm sorry to barge in on your Valentine.<br> I had to get away from the yelling.<br> Mona's dumping Ross.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - Poor Ross.<br> We watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes.<br> You know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.<br> We should warn you before you watch it.<br> Don't watch it.<br> You saw it? Is it scary? It's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.<br> Now I'm all freaked out.<br> Will you watch it with me? No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you.<br> Seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone.<br> She's right.<br> Of course not.<br> Honey, get the tape.<br> This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.<br> Here we go.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, my.<br> "All right", "baby.<br> One more time.<br>" Why is that baby torturing that woman? Why have I seen this thing three times? It's beautiful.<br> - It's horrible! - I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you! - You guys! You guys, look! - What? Did her ass explode? No, the baby's out.<br> Look.<br> Look at those little fingers and toes.<br> Look how happy the mom is now.<br> - Oh, Rach.<br> - Screw you! You don't have to do it! - Hey.<br> - Hey! - What's up? - Mona just dumped me.<br> Oh, man, I'm sorry.<br> Why? Lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.<br> I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.<br> I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.<br> Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.<br> In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner.<br> That really sucks.<br> Especially on Valentine's Day.<br> Wait a minute.<br> What are you doing here? Joey without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble? - Sort of.<br> - Really? You don't have to seem so happy about it.<br> Maybe I can help.<br> Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me.<br> You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex.<br> - So anyway, what is it? - Forget about it.<br> It's no big deal.<br> - Come on, what is it? - It's nothing.<br> Hey, it's me.<br> Why can't you tell me? Okay.<br> Sit down.<br> There's this woman that I like a lot.<br> But it can't happen.<br> She's not a Tribbiani? No! So is she someone from work? Yes.<br> Well, does she like you? Sometimes I think she could.<br> But I can't do anything about it.<br> Why not? It's complicated.<br> She was with this other guy.<br> Someone from work too.<br> I could never do that to the guy.<br> We're friends.<br> So this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her? - No, I don't think so.<br> - Okay.<br> Is he a good guy? Yeah, he's the best.<br> - Then talk to him.<br> - I don't know.<br> It's worth finding out, if you like her.<br> I do, so much.<br> I can't stop thinking about her.<br> I can't You know what? You have to go for it.<br> How often does this happen to you? You owe it to yourself.<br> Here's your warm milk.<br> I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.<br> Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay? Let me know how it goes.<br> It's Rachel.<br> You're having a baby and you need to prepare.<br> You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing.<br> Just do it! I came to the big city to become a star.<br> - I'll do anything to make that happen.<br> - Anything? Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.<br>   <br>
