The "big deal" is I was sitting there last! So.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it's my seat.<br> Well, actually, the last place you were sitting was in there, so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You guys, you know what? It doesn't matter.<br> You both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops.<br> I just have to do one thing.<br> It's not a big deal.<br> Get up! Phoebe, you look great!

That's funny.<br> Change.<br> -Hang on, I just got in.<br> -I don't care.<br> It starts at 8.<br> We can't be late.<br> "He could not, would not, want to wait.<br> " Our table is down in front.<br> My boss will be there.<br> Everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.<br> Has somebody been drinking my fat? Does this look like something a paleontologist's girlfriend would wear? I don't know.<br> You might be the first one.<br> -Rach, did you check the machine? -No.<br> Wait.<br> This is the outfit that makes my calves look fat.<br> Never mind.<br> Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today.<br> It's called, "Get up!

It's definitely old.<br> Didn't you hear the double beep? What if it's new? We agreed not to talk.<br> It could be important.<br> Shouldn't I call him back? Honey, you did call him back.<br> It's old.<br> Yeah, see, Mon, listen.<br> Listen.<br> When Carol and I broke up.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I went through the same thing.<br> You know what I did? I got dressed.<br> Really, really quickly, okay? Okay? There we go.<br> There we go.<br> You know what? Don't get up.<br> Just sit there.<br> I just hope you don't mind my hand right here.<br> Not touching.<br> Can't get mad! Not touching.<br> Can't get mad! Not touching.<br> Can't get mad! Oh, my God! You rotten boys! -Sorry, Phoebe.<br> -What am I gonna do? Don't rub it! What gets out hummus? What gets out hummus? Monica! What gets out hummus? If it is a new message, what is he calling to say? Okay, thanks.<br> Yeah, I'll try that.<br> Maybe he called to say you' re obsessive and crazy? -So should I call him back? -No! No! -Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.<br> -Fine with me.<br> I am so comfortable.<br> Me too.<br> In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.<br> Okay, we have 1 9 minutes.<br> I want you to go and change.<br> When you come back, Joey will go change and he'll have vacated the chair.<br> -Okay.<br> -All right.<br> Fine.<br> I' m going.<br> When I get back, it's Chair City.<br> And I' m the guy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who's sitting in a chair! Is this a little too-- Pheebs? What happened? I got the hummus.<br> Oh, honey, we'll find you something.<br> You wanna wear my black jacket? -It won't go with this dress.<br> -You' re right.<br> -Well, let's just get you out of that.<br> -No, no, no.<br> Not "out of that.<br> " -Not "out" of clothes.<br> -Can Phoebe borrow your green dress? I called him.<br> Yes.<br> I got his machine and I left a message.<br> But it's okay.<br> It's okay.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because it was, like, a casual, breezy message.<br> It was breezy.<br> Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy? How could it not be breezy? No.<br> Because you' re in such a breezy place.<br> I got it.<br> I'll play my message and you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.<br> But how you gonna do that? I know the code to his answering machine.<br> Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the-- Okay, you' re dialing.<br> You are dialing.<br> Hi, this is Richard.<br> Please leave a message at the tone.<br> You have two new messages.<br> What a cool job.<br> "You have two new messages.<br> " Please pass the pie.<br> Hi, it's Monica.<br> I'm just checking in.<br> I got a message and didn't know if it was old or new.<br> So I'm just checking.<br> So let me know.<br> Or don't.<br> Whatever.<br> I'm breezy! You can't say you' re "breezy.<br> " That negates the "breezy.<br> " Hola.<br> It's me.<br> Yesterday was really fun.<br> Call me about this weekend, okay? Now, she sounded breezy.<br> He's seeing someone.<br> I can't believe he's seeing someone.<br> -You don't know that.<br> -Well, whose voice was that? Maybe it was his sister's.<br> Maybe it was his daughter's.<br> Michelle.<br> Of course! Did it sound like Michelle? Oh, great.<br> It's starting to rain.<br> That'll make it easier to get a cab.<br> It was Michelle.<br> It was definitely Michelle.<br> Try Monica's green dress.<br> If it doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.<br> -Unless I wear it.<br> -You don't know what you' re wearing? I' m just trying to look nice for your big night.<br> Yeah, which we have to leave for in 1 2 minutes.<br> Come on, I'll just pick something out for you.<br> You'll notice that I' m fully dressed.<br> I, in turn, have noticed that you are not.<br> So in the words of A.<br>A.<br> Milne, "Get out of my chair, dill-hole.<br> " Okay.<br> -What are you doing? -You said to give you the chair.<br> You didn't say anything about cushions.<br> They' re the essence of the chair! That's right! I' m taking the essence.<br> Oh, he'll be back.<br> Oh, there's nobody in the room.<br> -I' m sorry, I thought it looked pretty.<br> -That was a Halloween costume.<br> Unless you would like me to go as Little Bo Peep.<br> I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.<br> Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler, I would like back one of these days.<br> Rach, good! Listen, isn't this perfect for me? Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.<br> Of course, not for tonight.<br> Hi.<br> I' m going to a benefit.<br> Not for tonight? What are you doing? No, I' m sorry.<br> We didn't mean it.<br> I love you.<br> Breathe.<br> We used them as pillows when we went camping.<br> What? The sheep.<br> Hey, what you do on your own time.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Where's my underwear? -Come on, you took his underwear? -He took my essence! Okay, hold on.<br> Why can't you just wear the underwear you' re wearing now? Because I' m not wearing any underwear now.<br> Then why do you have to wear underwear tonight? It's a rented tux, okay? I' m not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.<br> Then somebody's gonna have to give somebody back his cushions.<br> Okay.<br> You hide my clothes, I' m gonna do the exact opposite to you.<br> What, are you gonna show me my clothes? Hey, opposite.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is opposite.<br> He's got nothing! Okay, I' m ready.<br> Rachel didn't have anything I liked but this ribbon.<br> I thought, all right, I'll be political.<br> -What are you supporting? -Christmas.<br> Hey, that's okay with me.<br> Two down, and I have exactly 1 2 minutes-- What? My watch stopped.<br> My watch.<br> Okay, see.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the dinosaur tail isn't going around anymore.<br> What time is it? It's 7:33.<br> I have 7 minutes.<br> I have seven minutes! Which shoes should I wear? The black or the purple? -Just pick one, okay? -Oh, okay, okay.<br> The black.<br> Do you have black with little strappies? Yeah.<br> But those go better with pants.<br> Maybe I should wear pants.<br> Yeah, pants! What an idea! Or better yet, go without pants.<br> I don't know what you' re doing, but just get in there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and pick out any shoes that fit your feet.<br> I don't care if they match.<br> I don't care if they make.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat.<br> Just do it! Go in there, pick something out so we can go.<br> -All right.<br> -Thank you.<br> I've got to call Michelle to see if that was her voice.<br> It was.<br> It was her voice.<br> Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.<br> Hola.<br> Hello? Hello? -Okay.<br> That was her, right? -Definitely.<br> Yeah.<br> So there you go.<br> We' re out of the woods.<br> I think I'll get dressed now.<br> -I'll get it.<br> -Okay.<br> Hi, Monica and Rachel's.<br> Yeah, just a second.<br> Can I ask who's calling? It's Michelle! She must have that "caller l.<br>D.<br> " thing.<br> You should get that.<br> Michelle? Yeah, that was me.<br> I dialed your number by mistake.<br> Just try to be-- You' re so sweet.<br> Yeah, we were a great couple.<br> I know, I really miss him.<br> Well, you know how it is.<br> It's just that.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You know what's weird? Donald Duck never wore pants.<br> But when he gets out of the shower.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he always puts a towel around his waist.<br> I mean, what is that about? I only beeped in so I could hear my own message.<br> I mean, that's allowed.<br> I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell your dad about-- What do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with this? We' re friends! That bitch always hated me.<br> I' m calling her back.<br> -Okay, fine.<br> -Okay.<br> -She's got a phone in there, right? -Okay, we' re on it.<br> I know it says "black tie optional" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but this may be pushing it a little.<br> I' m not gonna go.<br> You' re not gonna go? No, I think I' m gonna catch up on my correspondence.<br> How can you not be going? I' m not gonna go.<br> So I think that will accomplish the "not going.<br> " You know, just out of curiosity-- Ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I' m just, I don't know, not in a very museum benefit-y kind of mood.<br> Right.<br> Well, okay.<br> Okay.<br> God, I' m sorry.<br> I' m sorry I yelled.<br> -That's fine.<br> -No, but you' re mad.<br> I' m not mad.<br> I' m just not going.<br> -Right.<br> -Okay.<br> You know that I have to go, right? So is it gonna be, like, I' m abandoning you while you' re upset? -No.<br> -No? -You' re not upset about the yelling.<br> -Right.<br> And the humiliating.<br> Well, of course, the humiliating.<br> So we.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we' re okay? -We' re good.<br> -Right.<br> -Honey? I love you.<br> -Yes, Ross.<br> Get away from that phone! She's just getting dressed now.<br> Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that? Okay, buddy boy, here it is.<br> You hide my clothes, I' m wearing everything you own.<br> Oh, my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear! Look at me! I' m Chandler.<br> Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> It's hot with all this stuff on.<br> I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.<br> Okay, enough.<br> Enough with the lunging.<br> I' m sick of this.<br> I've had it up to here.<br> Neither of you can come to the party! Jeez, what a baby! Way to ruin it.<br> I was just gonna go get dressed.<br> The only person I cared about getting dressed.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is the person who's not even gonna go.<br> Look, Rach, I' m sorry, okay? Look, I was a jerk, okay? I' m sorry I yelled.<br> I want you there.<br> I need you there.<br> What can I do to show you how much I want you to be there? You could drink the fat.<br> Welcome to an adult conversation.<br> No, no, no.<br> Now wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute.<br> -That actually sounds interesting.<br> -What? I think you should drink the fat.<br> Okay, if that's what it takes to show you how much you mean to me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and how much I want you there, that's what I'll do.<br> Let me get you another glass.<br> That's been sitting out.<br> I think this will be fine.<br> Okay, vanilla milkshake.<br> Just a vanilla milkshake.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>with chicken bits floating in it.<br> Cheers.<br> No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go.<br> I'll go.<br> You will? You were really gonna do that.<br> Well, yeah.<br> You were gonna drink the fat.<br> Let's see what else he'll do! How about you get changed? Give him his underwear.<br> I'll get a cab.<br> I want everyone downstairs in two minutes.<br> Monica! Stop it.<br> Stop it! Ross went to get a cab, so we-- What are you doing? No, Monica, no! Hi, this is Richard.<br> You have three new messages.<br> Not anymore.<br> Message erased.<br> To record your message, begin speaking at the tone.<br> Hi, Richard.<br> It's Monica.<br> Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.<br> Maybe I' m getting my period or something.<br> I don't know.<br> Anyway, I beeped into your machine and I heard this message.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that freaked me out.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and Michelle will tell you the rest.<br> I' m sorry, okay? And I hope that we can just forget the whole thing.<br> Your outgoing message has now been changed.<br> Outgoing? Did that say outgoing? Not outgoing! Hi, Richard, it's Monica.<br> Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.<br> Maybe I'm getting my period or something.<br> I don't know.<br> -How did you do that? -I don't know! Goodbye.<br> Okay, I've got two cabs and no people! Go, go, go! Maybe we can call the phone company to change the message? They could change his number.<br> I think after this, he'll be doing that himself.<br> Rachel! You.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You look.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> And I still have about five seconds to spare.<br> That was about 7 seconds.<br> So we' re a little late.<br> Come on.<br> Oh, and by the way.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> What? I' m going commando too.<br> Dr.<br> Geller? -Sherman Whitfield, London lnstitute.<br> -What a pleasure.<br> I was quite impressed with your paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.<br> Yes.<br> It confirmed everything I'd written.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hi.<br> Yes? You' re kind of sitting in my seat.<br> What do you mean, your seat? -I mean, I was sitting there.<br> -But you got up.<br> But I never left the room.<br> But you left the chair area.<br> All right, that's it.<br> Give me your underwear.<br>   <br>
