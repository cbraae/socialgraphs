Where'd you get him? -My friend Bethel saved him from a lab.<br> That is so cruel.<br> Why would a parent name their child Bethel? That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.<br> Is he gonna live with you in your apartment? Yeah.<br> It's been kind of quiet since Carol left.<br> Why not get a roommate? You reach a certain age, having a roommate is just kind of pathet That's " pathet.<br> " Sanskrit for " really cool way to live.<br> " The One With the Monkey I' m doing new material tonight.<br> I have 1 2 songs about my mother's suicide and one about a snowman.<br> You might wanna open with the snowman.<br> -Hi, Joey.<br> -Hey, buddy.<br> -So how'd it go? -I didn't get the job.<br> How could you not? You were Santa last year.<br> Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.<br> He's not even jolly.<br> It's all political.<br> -What are you gonna be? -One of his helpers.<br> It's just such a slap in the face, you know? Do you know what you' re doing for New Year's? Hey, what? What is wrong with New Year's? You have Paolo.<br> You don't have to face the pressure of finding lips to kiss when the ball drops! Man, I'm talking loud! Paolo's gonna be in Rome this New Year's.<br> -I'll be just as pathetic as you.<br> -Yeah, you wish.<br> I've got an idea.<br> Dinner.<br> It's perfect.<br> We'll put it between lunch and breakfast.<br> I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.<br> I say this year, we make a pact.<br> Just the six of us.<br> Dinner.<br> -Sure.<br> -Fine.<br> I was hoping for more enthusiasm.<br> -Phoebe, you' re on.<br> -Oh, good.<br> Hi.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand  Miss Phoebe Buffay.<br> Hi.<br> Thanks.<br> Hi.<br> I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me.<br> I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitching How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? My mother's ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar And sometimes when it's freezing I feel a little sneezy And now I Excuse me? Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.<br> Is it something you'd like to share with the group? No.<br> No, that's okay.<br> If it's important enough while I'm playing it's important enough for everyone else.<br> That guy's going home with a note.<br> -I was just saying -Speak up.<br> Sorry, l I was saying you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.<br> And he said that Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.<br> I said I liked her in Splash, but not Wall Street.<br> I thought she had a hard quality.<br> While Daryl is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace.<br> Then that's when you started yelling.<br> We're gonna take a short break.<br> That guy's going home with more than a note.<br> Come here, Marcel.<br> Sit here.<br> I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.<br> By my sixth date with Paolo, he'd already named both my breasts.<br> Did I just share too much? Just a smidge.<br> David's, like, a scientist guy.<br> He's very methodical.<br> -I think it's romantic.<br> -Me too! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman? He's kind of like the guy I went to see that with.<br> Except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter.<br> I just wanna be with him all the time.<br> You know, day and night.<br> And night and day.<br> And special occasions.<br> I see.<br> You're gonna ask him to New Year's.<br> -She's gonna break the pact.<br> -No! No, no.<br> No.<br> Yeah, could I just? -Yeah.<br> I already asked Janice.<br> -What? This was a pact! This was your pact! I couldn't handle the pressure.<br> I snapped! But that was the worst breakup in history! I'm not saying it was a good idea.<br> I snapped! Hi, sorry I'm late.<br> Too many jokes.<br> Must mock Joey.<br> Nice shoes, huh? God, you're killing me! Ross, he's playing with my spatulas again! -He's not gonna hurt them, right? -Do you always have to bring him? I didn't wanna leave him alone.<br> We had our first fight this morning.<br> It has to do with my working late.<br> I said some things that I didn't mean.<br> He threw some feces.<br> If you're working late, I can look in on him.<br> That would be great! But make sure it seems like you're there to see him.<br> You're not doing it for me.<br> Okay.<br> But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.<br> But you can't actually test this theory.<br> T oday's particle accelerators aren't powerful enough -to simulate these conditions.<br> -I have a question then.<br> -Yeah? -Do you plan on kissing me ever? That's definitely a valid question, and the answer would be yes.<br> Yes, I was.<br> But I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss at a phenomenal moment because it's you.<br> Sure.<br> The longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.<br> Now, it's just gotta be one of those things where l sweep everything off the table.<br> And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.<br> David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.<br> I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.<br> -Really? -I'm sure.<br> You should just do it.<br> Just throw me.<br> -Now? -Yeah, right now.<br> Just.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> You know what? This is really expensive.<br> And this was a gift.<br> -Now you' re just tidying up.<br> -Okay.<br> -You want me to throw you? -I can hop.<br> T ell me something, what does " no-date pact" mean to you? It's just that Chandler and Phoebe have somebody.<br> I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.<br> -Your ex-boyfriend? -Yeah.<br> -You know more than one Fun Bobby? -I happen to know a Fun Bob.<br> -Okay.<br> Here we go.<br> -There's no room for milk.<br> There.<br> Now there is.<br> So on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.<br> -Four.<br> -Five.<br> Sorry.<br> Paolo's catching an earlier flight.<br> And I met this really hot single mom at the store.<br> What's an elf to do? So I'll be the only one alone when the ball drops? We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.<br> I'll know.<br> This is so not what I needed right now.<br> -What's the matter? -Oh, it's Marcel.<br> He's angry with me.<br> I have no idea why.<br> He keeps shutting me out.<br> He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.<br> That's weird.<br> I had a blast with him.<br> -Really? -We played, watched TV.<br> That juggling thing is amazing.<br> What juggling thing? With the socks? I figured you taught him that.<br> No.<br> It wasn't that big a deal.<br> Just socks.<br> And a melon.<br> -Phoebe! -Max.<br> Do you know everybody? No.<br> Have you seen David?

And I was blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up.<br> So as I'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me! And I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle.<br> Everybody having fun at the party? -Are people eating my dip? -Yes.<br> There.<br> -That looks okay, right? -You went a bit wide on the lipstick.<br> -Oh, I did? -Yeah.<br> It's hard for me to tell.<br> My eye's closing up.<br> Let me get it for you.<br> -Ow! -Okay.<br> You know what?
