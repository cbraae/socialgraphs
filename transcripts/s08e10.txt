It's my fashion girls.<br> - What's wrong? - Why don't you sit down? Dina has something she wants to tell you.<br> What's going on? Is it Mom? Is she sick? Is it Dad's heart? Is that a sandwich? - Mom and Dad are fine.<br> - Is that a sandwich?! Joey, there's something that you should know.<br> Dina? - I'm pregnant.<br> - What? Now.<br> Give him the sandwich!

Dina I can't believe this.<br> You're the good one who went to college! - Both years! Who did this to you? - Bobby Corso.<br> He's a real nice guy.<br> - I like him a lot.<br> He's real funny.<br> - You got pregnant for "funny"? Dina, if he's funny, laugh! - I'll be back in a while.<br> Stay here! - Why? I can't look at you right now.<br> - Wow.<br> - I know.<br> - Oh, there you are, Ben.<br> - Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here? I heard you have a problem with one of the boys.<br> I thought I'd sit you both down and make it all okay.<br> Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.<br> Jack? I hate him.<br> He's a jerk.<br> Sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside but they have famous fathers.<br> - My friend Doug is waiting for me.<br> - Him, you're friends with.<br> - Can I help you with something? - Yes.<br> I'm looking for Jack's parents.<br> - Are you with a student? - I'm with Ben.<br> - Are you one of Ben's mothers? - I am one of Ben's mothers.<br> I'm a lesbian.<br> It was difficult coming out to my parents.<br> Well, hi.<br> I'm Jenny Boon.<br> I'm a new teacher here.<br> - I've only met your partner, Carol.<br> - That would make me Susan.<br> Are you looking for Jack's parents to discuss his problems with Ben? I think the parents should sit down together.<br> Yeah, let's do that! That sounds good.<br> We should sit down and talk.<br> Me, Carol and the Stings.<br> - How will I get in touch with them? - Their number's on the contact sheet.<br> Could I get a copy of that? Carol threw it out.<br> She lost ours.<br> She's such a scatterbrain.<br> But, man, what a hot piece of ass.<br> - That party wasn't bad.<br> - I didn't know there'd be dancing.<br> That was a fun surprise.<br> - I don't see a cab.<br> We should walk.<br> - No, we can't walk.<br> It's 15 blocks to the subway.<br> Let's go.<br> Do you think we can get to the subway if we climb through that manhole? - What's going on? - I can't walk, okay? - These boots were a huge mistake.<br> - What? You were right.<br> I never should've bought them.<br> They're killing me.<br> So I was right.<br> This is what it feels like to be right.<br> It's oddly unsettling.<br> How will we get home? A piggyback ride? - Hop on.<br> - Okay, wait.<br> Let me just get my boots off first.<br> Oh, God.<br> I know you're in pain right now, but I'm a little turned on.<br> Do you worry that you'll be walking and your baby will slip out? What college was that, Dina? Oh, my God.<br> Bobby? Hi, Dina.<br> Good to see you.<br> - Joey, what are you doing? - Just what needs to be done.<br> - Dearly beloved, we're gathered here - This is crazy.<br> Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God! - Where were we? Do you take this man - No! - You'll take him.<br> - I won't! - You don't get a say.<br> - I do.<br> - I heard "I do.<br>" We're halfway there.<br> - All right, Joey, that is enough! As moving as this is, this is not legal.<br> They don't have a marriage license or witnesses, and the groom has one shoe.<br> Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.<br> What am I to do? They are adults and can make their own decisions.<br> No, they can't.<br> They were stupid enough to get knocked up! Contraceptives are not always effective.<br> Right? - Yeah.<br> We kind of didn't use any.<br> - Come on, kids, a little help here! Wow! This place is incredible! Sting's pen that he gave to Phoebe.<br> Come on, secret passageway.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> I'm Trudie.<br> You must be Ben's mum.<br> - Why else would I be here? - Why don't you sit down? They haven't been getting along.<br> I'm sure there are two sides to this.<br> But all I've heard is that Ben's a "poo-poo-head.<br>" Won't Jack's father be joining us? I'm sorry.<br> Jack's father's not available.<br> Then, could we reschedule for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00? Oh, no, my husband's in concert.<br> Concert.<br> Yeah.<br> That just put us in quite a pickle.<br> I'm busy before and after the concert, and he's busy during.<br> So you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.<br> Unless Unless Okay, I would be willing to go to the concert all the while thinking about the children.<br> - Are you here for tickets? - Thank you.<br> Four would be great.<br> I'm not giving tickets to someone who'd use their son like this.<br> Then you're in luck.<br> Ben's not my son.<br> I've pressed a button triggering an alarm.<br> - Any minute the police will be here.<br> - The Police? Here? A reunion? Okay, ten blocks down.<br> Five to go.<br> - Oh, wait! Stop, stop, stop! - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Do you need a break? My boots in tan! Can I see the price? I can see it from right here.<br> It'll cost you one husband.<br> I can walk the rest of the way now.<br> Just give me my boots.<br> - I don't have your boots.<br> - Where are they? Why don't you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on hay? Okay.<br> My God, we gotta go back and get them! Are you ever gonna wear the boots again? I'll never wear them again.<br> I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.<br> You can say goodbye to the tan ones.<br> - Okay.<br> All right.<br> - Okay.<br> Bye, boots.<br> Wait! Half off! Just because they're not getting married doesn't mean it's a disaster.<br> - Maybe they have a plan.<br> - Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.<br> What's the future look like for Dina and Bobby? I really have high hopes for my band.<br> - You were right.<br> He is funny.<br> - Now wait a minute.<br> I bet when you told people you wanted to be an actor they laughed.<br> Tell us a bit about your band.<br> It's just me and my pal Rooster.<br> The band's name is Numbnuts.<br> Really? If you're having a baby, you should be married.<br> Even if it is to Bobby.<br> Dude, that's not a compliment.<br> - I knew you wouldn't be supportive.<br> - What are you gonna do? Have the baby and raise it without a husband? You can't be a single mother! You'll ruin your life! - Am I ruining my life? - No, it's different for you.<br> You're not some kid who doesn't know what she's doing.<br> - Excuse me? - One pregnant woman at a time, please! - I just want you to be okay.<br> - By forcing her to marry? Maybe.<br> Yeah.<br> So, what kind of music does Numbnuts Ah, forget it! I can't! I am scared to death about this.<br> But I can do it.<br> I just need some help.<br> - Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.<br> - You bet.<br> To answer your earlier question, we're straight up gangster rap.<br> Rachel's told me how easy you've made this on her.<br> - Why can't you do that for me? - Because you're my baby sister! And you're my big brother, my favorite guy in the whole world.<br> I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad.<br> I was scared of telling you.<br> I'd be scared of them, but all right.<br> I can't stand having this baby with you mad at me.<br> I want him to have his uncle.<br> Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey? Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey.<br> We'll be all right.<br> Even if we're not married, this baby will be so loved.<br> - And not just by us.<br> - That's right.<br> By his uncle too.<br> And by you.<br> Bobby, come over here and let them have a little moment, okay? Come here.<br> No, seriously, what's wrong with you? You're gonna love me so much.<br> I got Sting tickets! Oh, my God, I do love you! How did you do it? Well, let's just say: Ross can - Where are the seats? - Balcony.<br> Is that more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife or a member of his family? - Yeah.<br> - Then that's not breaking the law!   <br>
