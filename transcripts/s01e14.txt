An egg? Go up to her and say, "I'm returning your egg.<br>" I think it's winning.<br> -It's insane.<br> -She'll love it.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Thank you.<br> Here.<br> Go with the egg, my friend.<br> Go, go, go! -Think it'll work? -No way.<br> It's suicide.<br> The One With The Candy Hearts -You can't do this.<br> -Do what? -Roger wants to take her out.<br> -No! Remember why you dumped him? Because he was creepy.<br> And mean.<br> And frightening.<br> Still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day! You can go out with a creep any night.<br> I know I do.<br> -What are you doing tomorrow night? -That depends on how tonight goes.<br> -About tonight -Don't you bail on me! I said I'd bring a friend for her friend.<br> -But her friend sounds like a -Pathetic mess.<br> I know, but.<br> Come on.<br> She's needy, vulnerable.<br> I'm thinking.<br> Thanks.<br> You haven't been out with a woman since Janice.<br> You're doing this.<br> -She said yes.<br> -Way to go, man!

Oh  my God! Hey, it's Janice! Okay, I'm making a break for it! I've been waiting for, like, forever to go out with Lorraine.<br> -Just calm down.<br> -Calm down? You set me up with a woman I've dumped twice in the last five months! Can you stop yelling? You're making me nervous and.<br> I can't go when I'm nervous.<br> I'm sorry, you're right.<br> Come on! Do it, do it! Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete.<br> -Who? -Pete the Weeper.<br> The guy that used to cry every time we had sex? "Was it good for you?" I'd take crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy! "I win! I win!" We went out for two months.<br> I didn't win once.<br> How do we end up with these jerks? We're some kind of magnets.<br> I know I am.<br> That's why I can't wear a digital watch.<br> There's more beer, right? You know my friend who shaves her head? No.<br> I have this friend who shaves her head.<br> She says to break the bad boyfriend cycle you can do a cleansing ritual.<br> Pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald.<br> Yeah.<br> We can do it tomorrow night.<br> It's Valentine's Day.<br> It's perfect.<br> Okay, what kind of ritual? We can burn the stuff they gave us.<br> Or? Or we can chant and dance around naked with sticks.<br> Burning's good.<br> You know  I can pick up quarters with my toes.<br> Yeah? Good for you.<br> Quarters or rolls of quarters? By the way, I cut you out of all of my pictures.<br> So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.<br> That's okay.<br> You could make little puppets out of them.<br> And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty! -We can't do that! -What? What can't you do? Can I talk to you for a second? Over there? We might be leaving now.<br> Tell me it's you and me "we.<br>" She wants to slather my body with stuff and lick it off.<br> I'm not even sure what slathering is! But I definitely want to be a part of it! Okay, you cannot do this to me.<br> You're right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Can we have three chocolate mousses to go? I'm out of here.<br> Here's my credit card.<br> Dinner's on me.<br> I hope she throws up on you.<br> Thanks.<br> -So.<br> -Just us.<br> What a crappy night! I have enjoyed the fact that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper.<br> Excuse me.<br> How you doing? So do we have the best friends, or what? Joey's not a friend.<br> He's a stupid man who left us his credit card.<br> Another drink? Dessert? A big-screen TV? -I'll have a drink.<br> -Got it.<br> Good woman! -A bottle of overpriced champagne.<br> -Each.<br> That's right, each.<br> And a rob roy.<br> I've always wanted to know.<br> Happy Valentine's Day!

Ross, there's someone I want you to say hi to.<br> He happened to call.<br> Hi, Ross.<br> That's right, it's me! How did you know? So, if dogs experience jet lag  because of the seven dog years to one human year thing when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles  he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses a week and a half.<br> That's funny! They should be cooking the food soon.<br> Oh, good.<br> Who are they? The blond is my ex-wife.<br> The woman touching her is her close, personal friend.<br> -They're lovers? -lf you want to put a label on it.<br> -Anything else I should know? -Nope.<br> That's it.<br> Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.<br> I always forget that part.<br> Hello! Now we need sage branches and the sacramental wine.<br> All I had is oregano and a Fresca.<br> That's okay! Now we need the semen of a righteous man.<br> If we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.<br> -Can we start throwing things in? -Yeah, okay! Okay.<br> Barry's letters.<br> Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.<br> Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.<br> -A picture of Scotty Jared naked! -Let me see! -He's wearing a sweater.<br> -No.<br> -Whose MCl card is that? -Mine.<br> Shoot! Remember this number: Nine, seven, four.<br> Okay, and here we have the last of Paolo's grappa.<br> Wait, isn't it almost pure How can I dump this woman on Valentine's Day? I don't know.<br> You dumped her on New Year's.<br> In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.<br> Hello, funny valentine! Hi, just Janice.<br> Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.<br> I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna.<br> If you don't do it, I will.<br> -So are you actually from New York? -Not originally.<br> I'm from -You said they'd shoot it without you.<br> -I thought they could.<br> The maxi-pads were a piece of cake.<br> Mini-pads should be that much easier.<br> -It's Valentine's Day.<br> -I know, but it's my job.<br> I'll try to get back as soon as I can.<br> I'm spending most of my time teaching science which is funny because that wasn't even my major.<br> Now, that is funny! Do you think it would be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? Because she's alone now.<br> And pregnant.<br> And sad.<br> -I guess.<br> -Are you sure? Carol! -Wanna join us? -No, I'm fine.<br> Come on.<br> These people will scooch down.<br> You guys will scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on! -Come on.<br> -Thank you.<br> IKristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.<br> Carol, Kristen.<br> -How do you do? -Carol teaches sixth grade.<br> And Kristen.<br> IKristen does something that, funnily enough wasn't even her major! -Thanks for coming over.<br> -Not at all.<br> It's pretty much our job.<br> That's why we get the cool hats.<br> -What do we got there? -A piece of sik boxer shorts.<br> Some greeting cards.<br> A half-charred picture of.<br> That guy's hairier than the chief! It's a really funny story how this happened.<br> I was taking out the trash, and Phoebe was burning incense It's all right.<br> This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire we've seen get out of control.<br> -Third one tonight.<br> -Really? Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.<br> Next time you're burning your ex-boyfriend's stuff: One, do it in a well-ventilated area.<br> Two, if you wanna burn his clothing, stay away from synthetic fabrics.<br> Three, try to let go of the anger, and learn to love yourself.<br> -I brought you something.<br> -ls it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.<br> "Chan and Jan Forever.<br>" I had them made special.<br> Okay, Janice.<br> Hey, Janice.<br> There's no way to tell you this.<br> At least, there's no new way.<br> I just don't think things are gonna work out.<br> That's fine.<br> It is? Because I know that this isn't the end.<br> You see, actually, it is.<br> No, because you won't let that happen.<br> Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing! Oh, no, I don't.<br> Why do we keep ending up together? New Year's, who invited who? -Valentine's, who asked who into bed? -I did, but You seek me out! Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn! Janice! Janice! You push me away, you pull me back! You want me.<br> You need me.<br> You can't live without me.<br> And you know it.<br> You just don't know you know it.<br> See? Call me! It's not true.<br> I never called your mother a wolverine.<br> You did so, I swear to How long has she been in the bathroom? She isn't in the bathroom.<br> Her coat's gone.<br> Well, maybe it's cold in there.<br> I screwed up my first date in nine years.<br> -That could be it.<br> -Oh, God.<br> You know, this is still pretty hot.<br> Mushroom.<br> Smile.<br> They won't all be like this.<br> Some might stay through dinner.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> That's not funny.<br> -It's just.<br> You know the whole "get on with your life" thing? Well, do I have to? I'm sitting here with this cute woman and she's perfectly nice, but that that's it.<br> Then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.<br> And I don't have to.<br> -I know.<br> -You know? Here's a wacky thought.<br> Let's say you and I give it another shot.<br> I know what you're gonna say.<br> You're a lesbian.<br> But what do you say we just put that aside for now.<br> Let's just stick a pin in it.<br> Because we're great together.<br> You can't deny it.<br> I've got a ring at home that fits you.<br> I've got lots of pictures with both of us in them.<br> And best of all, you're carrying my baby.<br> -I mean, how perfect is that? -Ross You keep saying that, but there's something right here.<br> I love you.<br> I love you too.<br> -But -No "but.<br>" You know that thing we put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out.<br> You'll find someone.<br> The right woman is waiting for you.<br> It's easy for you to say.<br> You found one already.<br> All you need is a woman who likes men, and you'll be set.<br> Not her.<br> So, you guys really slide down a pole? -Absolutely.<br> -That's so cool.<br> How do you get back up? Well, we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly.<br> So, would you guys.<br> Would you like to, sometime, maybe.<br> Go for a drink sometime? Sure, sounds good.<br> We get off at midnight.<br> We'll pick you up then.<br> Okay.<br> Great! So will you bring the truck? I'll even let you ring the bell.<br> -We'll see you later.<br> -Bye! See you later! Oh, my God! See? There you go.<br> The cleansing worked.<br> You're right.<br> They're nice guys! They're firemen guys! -Tell them you're married? -No.<br> My girlfriend doesn't even know.<br>   <br>
