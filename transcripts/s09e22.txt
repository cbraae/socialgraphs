                    			Oh, that feels so good.<br> Oh, lucky me.<br> Coffee and a live sex show.<br> - I'm sorry, what? - I'm sorry.<br> - Nothing.<br> I was just reading to Emma.<br> - From "Cosmo"? Yeah.<br> Yeah, it's: "Climax Your Way to Better Skin.<br>" So I have to go shopping today, which is my least favorite thing.<br> I'm so bad at picking out clothes.<br> So you need someone who knows fashion to tell you what looks good.<br> Not me.<br> Not me.<br> Not me.<br> - Oh, hey, Rach? - Yeah? - Maybe you could take Charlie shopping? - Oh, well - I'm sure you have better things to do.<br> - You kidding? Rachel loves to shop, and she has great taste.<br> She's the one that taught me not to wear white after Labor Day and to always, always, always put on underwear when trying on clothes.<br> If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.<br> Okay.<br> Yeah, let's shop.<br> Okay, you are gonna come back with some very classy clothes.<br> And some slutty lingerie.<br> Slutty! Okay, great.<br> All right, bye.<br> Pain in the ass! - That's off, right? - What's the matter, Pheebs? Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight and he's gonna be there.<br> She was like, "Don't worry.<br> I asked him and he's totally okay with seeing you.<br>" So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally okay with seeing him.<br> - Which you're not.<br> You're hung up on him.<br> - Exactly.<br> You want him to eat his heart out, so you have to look fabulous.<br> I didn't even think about that.<br> Sexual politics! Pheebs, I'm taking Charlie shopping.<br> - Come and I'll help you find something.<br> - That'd be great.<br> Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you, trying on slutty lingerie together.<br> - That's not what we're gonna do.<br> - Why'd you ruin it? Who was I hurting? The One With The Donor mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.<br> I still can't believe this.<br> My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I've always tried so hard to be a good hostess.<br> I can't believe my sperm have low motility.<br> While I was growing up, they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places.<br> - Hi there.<br> - Hi.<br> I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your tests last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.<br> Okay.<br> Even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great you never know, so keep having sex on a regular basis.<br> Oh, damn it! Don't worry.<br> After a while, you'll tune it out.<br> Given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor.<br> If you feel that neither of those is right for you, you could always adopt.<br> Is that a hint? Because we love you, Dr.<br> Connelly, but we don't want you to be our child.<br> Wow! Talk about an inhospitable environment.<br> Hi.<br> Okay, you ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping? - Let's do it.<br> - All right, have a good time.<br> Not gonna find any clothes in there.<br> - Hey, you guys.<br> - Hi.<br> Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference? - Chris Bailey? - Yeah, right.<br> When was the last time he made a submission deadline for an abstract? Why are you laughing? Just seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist.<br> It's fun.<br> Yeah.<br> So you're up for keynote speaker? - Who's deciding? - Professor Sherman.<br> - I'm meeting with him today.<br> - He's a pretty tough guy to impress.<br> I think I know how to dazzle him.<br> You're not gonna to do a magic trick, are you? No.<br> - Hey, guys.<br> - I want to ask you something.<br> I may get to speak at this paleontology convention.<br> If I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.<br> I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work and/or are sick.<br> - It's in Barbados.<br> - But you come first.<br> I'm there.<br> - We'll see you guys.<br> - Bye.<br> See you.<br> - So how did it go at the fertility clinic? - Not as much fun as last time.<br> Apparently, you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.<br> So, what did the doctor say? There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt her whole life of carrying a child and she just felt that watching a surrogate would be too hard for her.<br> - So you're ruling out surrogacy? - Yeah.<br> So I don't have to learn what that means? Aside from adoption, the only other choice is insemination so we're talking about sperm donors.<br> Enough said.<br> I'm there for you, man.<br> Where is she, upstairs? How do you feel about all this? I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child, but there isn't one.<br> Come on, Ross, be a good guy.<br> Step up and do it.<br> What? What?! No! I'm not gonna give them Ben! The data we're receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are staggering.<br> I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given.<br> But if they're off by even a 100,000 years or so then you can just throw most of our assumptions you know, right in the trash.<br> So, what I'm saying is Is that Is that repercussions could be huge.<br> I mean, not just in paleontology, but if you think about it in evolutionary biology, genetics, geology.<br> I mean, truly, the mind boggles.<br> Well, that's not what you want.<br> - Incentive for Men? - I'll take some of that.<br> - Pheebs, that's for men.<br> - I know.<br> When I go to the party later Mike will know I'm over him because I'll smell like another guy.<br> Okay.<br> Oh, good, I'm dating a Russian cabdriver.<br> Seriously, does anyone buy this? I smell like beets.<br> I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads in them.<br> Where are those? On Melanie Griffith in "Working Girl".<br> I think what you want is over here.<br> See, I told you I needed someone.<br> By the way, as a thank you, I would really love to take you out.<br> - Really? - Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.<br> - You want to come? - Oh, I can't.<br> Because I've seen them.<br> You've seen all the movies? Yeah.<br> I'm a big fan.<br> Of the movies.<br> You know, motion pictures.<br> The talkies.<br> Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room? - Sure.<br> - Okay.<br> Maybe we could do something else.<br> You know, that depends on what it is.<br> I've done a lot of stuff.<br> So, what were you doing out there? Do you not like Charlie? She's okay.<br> I don't know, I just don't get a really good vibe from her.<br> - Why? - I don't know.<br> You know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart and tall, you know and just swept Joey off his feet.<br> Nobody else has a chance.<br> Who else? Anybody.<br> You.<br> Me.<br> You know, Monica's mom.<br> You like Joey?! Phoebe! All right, look, I do.<br> I have a little thing for him.<br> Just - Oh, my God.<br> - It's just physical.<br> I have it totally under control, okay? It's just when I see them together sometimes, I just get a little jealous.<br> Wow.<br> Isn't that ironic that he liked you, and now you like? I get it! All right, as long as it's under control.<br> You can't do anything about it.<br> He's already dating her.<br> She is a nice person.<br> That wouldn't be right.<br> I know, I know.<br> So it's just not a big deal.<br> - So can we keep this between us? - Sure.<br> Great, because I gotta get out of here.<br> The smell of beets is killing me.<br> Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin? - Hi, honey.<br> - Hey.<br> I brought a friend home for dinner.<br> This is Zack from work.<br> Oh, of course.<br> It's so nice to see you again, Zack.<br> - You too.<br> - You guys haven't actually met before.<br> But, boy, you're both polite.<br> Have a seat.<br> I'll get you a beer.<br> - I got it.<br> - Thanks.<br> - So Zack's pretty nice, huh? - Yeah, I guess.<br> So how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his? Excuse me? We're talking about sperm donors, and Zack may be the guy.<br> Look.<br> He's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic.<br> I mean, he's sperm-tastic! Chandler, this is crazy.<br> Well, what did you even say to him? "Come up.<br> Meet my wife.<br> Give us your sperm.<br>" I invited him to dinner so you'd get a chance to get to know him.<br> With a sperm bank, you never meet the guy, get to check him out.<br> - Chandler! - I'm telling you, he's great.<br> I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I think he'd be the way to go.<br> I'm not going to be a part of this.<br> You can't bring some random guy home and expect him to be our sperm donor.<br> Okay.<br> - Zack? - Thanks.<br> Do you have a coaster? I don't want to make a ring.<br> Tell me about yourself, Zack.<br> Oh, God, do you think she heard? Lt'd be so bad if she heard.<br> Maybe she didn't hear.<br> I'll go into that dressing room and talk.<br> You stay here.<br> - See if you can hear me.<br> - Okay, great.<br> Oh, thank God, I can't hear a word that you're saying.<br> - I didn't say anything yet.<br> - Well, get back in there and talk.<br> I'm Rachel.<br> It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.<br> What? Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.<br> Okay, well, I heard that.<br> Which means that she heard it too.<br> - We have a problem.<br> - Oh, what are we gonna do? Just be honest with her.<br> Oh, my God! It is annoying when parents put babies on the phone.<br> All right, enough out of you! - Hello? - I need to talk to Charlie.<br> Is she there? No, she went shopping with Rachel.<br> Why? What's up? I'm meeting with Professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker.<br> - How's it going? - It could be better.<br> He fell asleep.<br> What? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda! - Barbados.<br> - Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.<br> You have to get that job.<br> What am I supposed to do? He's out cold.<br> In fact, he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to "spank him harder.<br>" - Well, just wake him up.<br> - I can't.<br> If he realizes that I'm the one who put him to sleep, I won't get the job.<br> That's a tough one.<br> Oh, wait a minute.<br> This happened to me before.<br> Yeah, I was auditioning for a play, and the producer fell asleep.<br> L No, wait a minute.<br> It was me who fell asleep.<br> I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while? - Hey, guys, dinner's ready.<br> - I'm gonna go wash up first.<br> Thanks.<br> What do you think? I want his genes for my kid.<br> Those eyes, those cheekbones.<br> Okay, there's enthusiastic, and there's just plain gay.<br> - You don't like him.<br> - I think he's fine.<br> But we don't know anything real about him.<br> - I wish we could get more information.<br> - All right, just follow my lead.<br> - You guys have a great place here.<br> - Thanks.<br> I'm crazy about our place.<br> Hey, speaking of crazy do you have a history of mental illness in the family? No.<br> Although, I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.<br> That's really not the kind of thing we're looking for.<br> Okay.<br> So tell me, how'd you guys meet? Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story.<br> I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes? No.<br> Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout? You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh? We're just making conversation.<br> Yeah, well, okay.<br> I heard a joke today.<br> It's pretty funny.<br> You know what's not funny? Male pattern baldness.<br> You guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight, and I'm flattered and quite frankly, a little frightened.<br> Can we just talk about something else? - Sure.<br> - All right.<br> This ravioli's delicious.<br> I notice you're enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth.<br> Did you have braces as a child? - No, I didn't.<br> - Yes! We're teeth people, Zack.<br> Let's just do it.<br> Let's just go over there and see if she heard.<br> - Good plan.<br> - Okay.<br> - What? Where are you going? - Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.<br> I don't have time for your childish games, okay? I still have to find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "Who's More Over Who"! - Where have you been? - Trying on clothes.<br> Oh, really? In the dressing room? Well, that's so weird.<br> Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.<br> Gosh, it's just such a small world.<br> Rachel, I heard you two guys whispering.<br> Oh, God, you did, you heard.<br> Okay, look, let me explain.<br> There's nothing to explain.<br> I heard you.<br> Phoebe likes Joey.<br> Yeah.<br> I don't understand it.<br> I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she's here to buy a dress to impress another guy? Yeah, that's Phoebe.<br> That's Phoebe.<br> You know, she just wants them all.<br> It's, like, she's nympho.<br> - Wow! - Yeah.<br> You know, by the way, I heard you tell her not to do anything.<br> Thanks for sticking up for me.<br> God, you are such a nice person.<br> I try.<br> Oh, my God, you really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you! You're welcome.<br> Wow! You look stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness.<br> Okay, are you sure? Because I am really dreading going to this party.<br> Then don't go.<br> Mike knows I'm coming.<br> If I don't show up, he'll think it's because of him and then I'm gonna lose face.<br> That's a very serious thing in my culture.<br> All right, then you go to that party, and you pretend to be over Mike.<br> Afterward, you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk.<br> You got it.<br> Okay.<br> But not on the wine that you made, okay? Because I just don't want to go back to the emergency room.<br> David? Phoebe! Hi.<br> - Oh, my God! - Hi.<br> Wow! You look unbelievable.<br> Oh, yeah, well What are you doing here? Well, I'm back from Minsk.<br> Permanently.<br> Well, what happened? Remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles? Yeah.<br> Well, after eight years of research, I discovered that it can't be done.<br> Well great that you're back.<br> How are you? - Good.<br> Good.<br> Life is good.<br> - Good.<br> Well, I'm seeing someone.<br> - Good for you.<br> - Yeah.<br> She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and It's actually because of you that we're together.<br> I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy and I just said, "Boy, I want that.<br>" - Mike and I broke up.<br> - You're kidding me.<br> Because I'm not seeing anybody.<br> I just totally made that up.<br> - Really? - I don't know why, I'm sorry.<br> I guess I just didn't want to lose face.<br> I understand.<br> Yeah.<br> Okay.<br> So then, okay So we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone.<br> - That's so not like us.<br> - Yeah, I know.<br> Well, this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that but do you have someplace that you need to be right now? Well No.<br> - Well, do you want to get a drink? - I'd love to.<br> - Great.<br> - Okay.<br> Do you smell beets? All right, stay upwind of me.<br> Hey, there's Phoebe.<br> Is that Mike she's with? No, that's David.<br> There's a third guy? Tip of the iceberg.<br> I'm gonna take off now.<br> You're gonna let me go home, aren't you? Sure you don't want to stay a little longer? No, I should get home.<br> I'm kind of tired.<br> Are you always tired? Because that could be a sign of clinical depression.<br> No, it's tiring to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died.<br> - I'll see you tomorrow.<br> - Okay.<br> Bye.<br> I think we found our sperm.<br> He does seem pretty perfect.<br> Yeah? You think so? Should I ask him? No.<br> Why not? Just because his great-grandmother was obese? Our kid's gonna get that from you anyway.<br> No, that's not it.<br> It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before I just realized I don't care if he is the most perfect guy in the world.<br> - He's not you.<br> - Yeah, he's better! No, he's not.<br> If I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by him or anyone else.<br> - Really? Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.<br> Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either.<br> I was just doing it because I thought that was what you wanted.<br> I'm the husband.<br> I'm supposed to bring the sperm.<br> That is so sweet.<br> I love you.<br> So you know this leaves us with Adoption.<br> How do you feel about that? I think I feel okay about it.<br> Actually, I think I feel really good about it.<br> Me too.<br> I wanna find a baby that needs a home, and I wanna raise it with you.<br> And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.<br> So this is it? We're really gonna adopt? Yeah.<br> - Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents! - We are gonna be great parents.<br> And it could be soon.<br> I mean, think about it.<br> Right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.<br> Wait.<br> If we're lucky, and we're really, really, really quiet we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking.<br> Hey, Zack.<br> Hey, Chandler.<br> I wanted to apologize for last night.<br> I got the feeling we made you uncomfortable.<br> - No, you didn't.<br> - Really? No, you did.<br> My wife and I have some boundary issues.<br> Sometimes we ask inappropriate questions.<br> We're working on it.<br> - Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.<br> - Thank you.<br> You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would you?   <br>
