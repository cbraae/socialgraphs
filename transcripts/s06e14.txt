                    			Oh! Hey, Rach.<br> I was just coming over here to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore.<br> I'm eating their food.<br> You? Ross is on a date with my sister.<br> They shut the drapes two hours ago.<br> I didn't know we could date your sister.<br> We know you steal our food.<br> I'm good.<br> Drapes still closed? Yeah.<br> That perverted couple two doors over should've shut theirs.<br> -Is that a swing? -Oh, don't even ask.<br> I can't believe Ross is with her sister.<br> When Chandler kissed my sister, I was mad for 1 0 years.<br> -That was five years ago.<br> -You got five years left.<br> -Joey-- -Want to make it six? The One Where Chandler Can't Cry Gelula/SDI Oh, Ross, hey.<br> Hi, how are you? There you are.<br> Can I get a cup of coffee? So how was your big date last night? It was okay.<br> It was fun.<br> It was fun? Great.<br> So did you guys hit it off? I guess so.<br> So did anything happen? Rumor has it you guys shut the drapes.<br> No.<br> No.<br> Nothing happened.<br> I shut the drapes to show her slides of my favorite fossils.<br> Oh, slides! So really nothing happened.<br> Something could've happened.<br> She really dug my slides.<br> And she was definitely giving me the vibe.<br> Was it the "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite" vibe? Anyway.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> If she wasn't into me, why would she ask me out again? -She asked you out again? -Yeah.<br> Tomorrow night.<br> Valentine's Day.<br> The most romantic day of the year.<br> Who knows what could happen.<br> I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides.<br> Okay! I got it, I got it.<br> I can't go with the "you and my sister" thing.<br> It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together.<br> It just freaks me out.<br> I can't do it! It's okay.<br> It's too weird for you.<br> I won't see her again.<br> Thank you.<br> After tomorrow night.<br> No! I can't do it.<br> It's gonna freak me out! Okay, okay, okay! Okay.<br> I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.<br> Ross, thanks.<br> Want me to call her now? Oh, no.<br> No, no, no.<br> No.<br> Come on, I mean, that's crazy.<br> So, what's going on with you? Well.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I may teach another class this semester.<br> Do it now.<br> Call her now.<br> -This is my favorite part.<br> -Me too.<br> You know what's sadder than this? Bambi.<br> I cried for three days with that movie.<br> No, two.<br> The third day my mom killed herself, so I was partly crying for that.<br> Well, that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon.<br> You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died? Yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer.<br> It's okay to cry.<br> You don't have to be macho all the time.<br> I'm not macho.<br> Yeah, you're right.<br> I don't know what I was thinking.<br> I just never really cried.<br> I'm not a crying kind of guy.<br> Come on, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up.<br> Like.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> What if you saw a three-legged puppy? I'd be sad, sure.<br> But I wouldn't cry.<br> What if the puppy said, "Help me, Chandler.<br> All the other puppies pick on me.<br> " Cry? I just found a talking puppy.<br> I'm rich! I've got it.<br> I have got it.<br> Pictures from your childhood.<br> This'll get you going good.<br> Oh, what's going on there? Parents' Day.<br> First grade.<br> That's me with the janitor, Martin.<br> -Where are your parents? -They didn't want to come.<br> -Chandler! -Poor thing.<br> That story doesn't make you cry? No.<br> Look, I don't cry.<br> It's not a big deal, okay? No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all! You're dead inside! -Excuse me? -Yeah? -Are you Phoebe Buffay? -Yeah.<br> Can I get your autograph? I'm your biggest fan.<br> My biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you.<br> Sure.<br> Yeah.<br> Wow.<br> Wow, thanks a lot.<br> I just want to say I think you're really talented.<br> You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan.<br> Take good care of that guy.<br> He's a fan.<br> Bye.<br> So you saw me on Days of Our Lives, huh? You want me to do a little Doctor Drake Ramoray for you? I have no idea what you're talking about.<br> But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph.<br> Oh.<br> You're Phoebe's fan.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I've seen all her movies.<br> Movies? That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.<br> I don't think so.<br> No, it was.<br> She was in Sex Toy Story Two Lawrence of a Labia.<br> And I got her autograph.<br> The guys at the comic book store won't believe this.<br> Gunther? Don't let that guy in here anymore.<br> He said Phoebe's a porn star.<br> Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good.<br> You should check out lnspect Her Gadget.<br> -Hey.<br> -Hey.<br> Ross just totally blew me off, and he didn't even tell me why.<br> Oh, well.<br> The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else.<br> Oh! There is this great guy you will just love at work, named Bob.<br> He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.<br> Thanks, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.<br> Not random.<br> Bob.<br> It's probably because I'm not mature enough or smart enough.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.<br> No, that can't be it.<br> It's gotta be the smart thing.<br> I'm so stupid.<br> I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty, stupid girl.<br> No, honey.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> You want to know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.<br> You asked him to? -Why? -Because you are my sister.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and Ross and I have this huge history.<br> You want to go out with Ross? No.<br> You don't want him, but you don't want me to? You know, Bob in Human Resources.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I can't believe you did this! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense! It's not that big a deal.<br> Just don't date Ross.<br> There's other-- You have no right to tell me what to do.<br> I'm not telling you what to do.<br> I am telling you what not to do! Why are you so jealous of me? This is not about me being jealous.<br> It's about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have.<br> Can't have? Excuse me.<br> The only thing I can't have is dairy! Well, you just blew your chances at dating Bob! -Who? -With Human Resources! Jealous of her? Who does she think she is, Princess Caroline? -You're jealous of Princess Caroline? -Do I have my own castle? Hey.<br> -Phoebe's not here, is she? -No.<br> Did you get a movie? Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> But I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.<br> Not more movies that'll have us reaching for the tissues all night? Sort of.<br> What's going on? Phoebe's a porn star! -What? -Yeah! What are you talking about? "Phoebe Buffay in Buffay The Vampire Layer.<br> " That's Phoebe.<br> Where did you get that? At the adult video place on Bleecker.<br> And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to surprise him.<br> Then I pretended that I didn't know he was in there.<br> Wow.<br> I mean, I just can't believe this.<br> I mean, you think you know someone.<br> Even Phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark.<br> This is so bizarre.<br> I guess it makes sense.<br> She had such a terrible childhood.<br> I had a bad childhood and I don't do porn.<br> Yes, but you're dead inside.<br> I'd better take that back.<br> What, why? Why? We can't watch it.<br> It's Phoebe.<br> We shouldn't watch this.<br> Absolutely not.<br> That goes back.<br> -Maybe a bit.<br> -The first half? This is wrong, you guys! Phoebe's our friend! -I'm not gonna watch it.<br> -Yeah! Good for you, Joe.<br> I thought I'd find you here, Nosferatool.<br> Are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places? Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.<br> What's that on her ankle? Her ankle is what you're watching? Well, it's hard to tell.<br> God, if she would just stop moving.<br> She's just doing her job.<br> You sick bastards! It's a tattoo.<br> That's weird.<br> Phoebe doesn't-- Wait, that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula! Wait, wait! I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it! Hey.<br> What's up? Oh, my God! What am I doing?! Hey, sweetie.<br> "Chicken Soup for the Soul"? There's no back to this couch.<br> You hate this kind of stuff.<br> I figured I'd give it a shot.<br> One of the stories may make me cry, then you won't think I'm dead inside.<br> Oh, that's so sweet.<br> I don't care if you can't cry.<br> I love you.<br> Oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.<br> Stop it.<br> Seriously.<br> We get married, I'm up at the altar and I'm like this: I won't care.<br> I know that you'll be feeling it all in here.<br> -Yeah? -Yeah.<br> And if we have a baby one day.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you don't cry, so what? If we take him to college and go home.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and we see his empty room for the first time.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you got nothing? It won't matter to me.<br> Okay.<br> I won't worry about this anymore then.<br> And then, you know, if I die.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>from a long illness.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you're writing my eulogy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says: "I will always be with you" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you still can't shed one tiny tear? I know you'll be crying a river inside.<br> -I love you.<br> -What is wrong with you?! -What? -What? You can't shed a tear for your dead wife? I left you a note from the beyond! -So you didn't mean any of that? -No, you robot! You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time and I swear-- Oh, Jill! That's a game I play with the kids down the hall.<br> They've really taken a liking to me.<br> What's the matter? Rachel and I had a big fight.<br> Can I come in? I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore.<br> I don't know anybody in this city and I need somebody to talk to.<br> Sure.<br> What happened? I don't want to talk about it.<br> Okay.<br> -You know what might cheer me up? -What? Seeing some more of your super cool slides.<br> -Wow, really? -Totally.<br> I loved them.<br> You could finish telling me about the different kinds of sand.<br> I'd love to.<br> Wait right here, I'll go get the projector and my notes.<br> Thanks.<br> You're such a good friend.<br> Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her.<br> -No.<br> -Is Ross home? Maybe I'll call him and see if he's seen her-- Who is it? It's Phoebe.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> "Phoebe! " Hey! Oh, God! So you're making porn movies.<br> No, I'm not.<br> We're still rolling! You're making one right now! Let's go, Phoebe.<br> And you're using my name.<br> Can I help you with something? Phoebe, come on! Look, I'm talking right now.<br> You mean her.<br> Oh.<br> You know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.<br> What? I could talk them into giving you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>thirty dollars.<br> No! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you, with that! The slides are almost ready.<br> Yeah.<br> I know what this is missing: Alcohol.<br> There's wine in the kitchen.<br> Oh, great.<br> What is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut? Okay.<br> Rach, calm down, okay? She's really upset.<br> We're just talking.<br> She's making something happen with you to get back at me.<br> That's the only reason she could be here, huh? It couldn't be that maybe I'm a good listener.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I put on a great slide show? Ross, I am telling you, she is using you to get back at me.<br> I think I can take care of myself.<br> I'll talk to you later.<br> Goodbye.<br> That was your sister, actually.<br> She thinks you're just using me.<br> So? -Hey.<br> -Hey.<br> I just came from the company Ursula works for.<br> Oh, no, not you too? I went to get Phoebe Buffay's checks.<br> There were a lot of them.<br> Nice! And I won't have to go back there anymore.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because I gave them my "correct address.<br> " Isn't it gonna bother you that people think you're a porn star? Oh, no, I know how to handle it.<br> -Good.<br> -Yeah.<br> Trying to figure out how you know me? I'll give you a hint.<br> From porn! Yeah, your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! -See? -Yeah.<br> Hey.<br> You may have been right about Jill.<br> I knew it! What happened? She kissed me.<br> What? You kissed? Maybe we should give them some privacy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay? Doesn't sound like it.<br> It's easy not to kiss someone.<br> You just don't.<br> Look at us right now, not kissing! Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I didn't stop it.<br> I guess I just wasn't thinking.<br> Yeah.<br> Let me give you something to think about.<br> Hold on! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.<br> Thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth to tell me that.<br> I realized if anything happened with me and Jill.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then nothing could ever happen with us.<br> -What? -No, I mean.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>again, ever.<br> But I don't want to know that it never could.<br> So I stopped it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and she got mad and broke my projector.<br> Wow.<br> I don't even know what to say.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> My God, are you crying? I just don't see why those two can't work things out! All right, I'm leaving.<br> I'm not spending one more day with someone who's out to sabotage me.<br> That's you, Rachel.<br> Yeah, I got that.<br> And you! I throw myself at you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you say no? How gay are you? You take care, Jill.<br> -Okay, see you.<br> -Bye-bye.<br> I can't believe Jill's gone.<br> I can't help it, I opened a gate!   <br>
