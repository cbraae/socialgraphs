That's a baby.<br> He should take the sack? Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield.<br> And I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there's no way I'm not gonna get there in time.<br> So I am running and I'm running and that is when I woke up.<br> See, I am so not ready to be a father.<br> Hey, you're gonna be fine.<br> You're one of the most caring, responsible men in North America.<br> You're gonna make a great dad.<br> Yeah, Ross.<br> You and the baby just need better blocking.<br> Oh.<br> Have either of you ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it expensive? Only if you order stuff.<br> I'm taking Ursula tonight.<br> It's her birthday.<br> - Whoa.<br> What about Phoebe's birthday? - When's that? ROSS: Uh tonight.<br> Ugh, man, what are the odds of that happening? You take your time.<br> There it is.<br> So, what are you gonna do? What can I do? I don't want to screw it up with Ursula.<br> And your friend Phoebe? If she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand.<br> Wouldn't you guys? Man, if you tried that on my birthday you'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit.<br> You add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.<br> Okay, uh - Monica? - Yes? Yes, she is.<br> - Hi.<br> This is my friend Rachel.<br> - Hi.<br> Hi, uh, Rachel, I'm Dr.<br> Mitchell.<br> And I'm his friend Dr.<br> Rosen.<br> Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor? Excuse me?

PLAYING ON STEREO] So he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.<br> Uh, you left out the stupid part.<br> It's not stupid.<br> The very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes.<br> I think it's totally insane.<br> I mean, they work for the hospital.<br> It's like returning to the scene of the crime.<br> - I say we blow off the dates.<br> - What? Monica, they are cute.<br> They are doctors.<br> Cute doctors.<br> Doctors who are cute.<br> All right, what have we learned so far? [KNOCK ON DOOR] [MUSIC STOPS] ALL: Surprise!

Did you see Betty? I tell you, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried-tomato business.<br> Five years ago, if somebody'd said to me, "Here's a tomato that looks like a prune" I'd have said, "Get out of my office.<br>" Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? I'm not freaking out.<br> I'm just saying if someone had come to me with the idea Dad, Dad, Dad.<br> I'm talking about the whole, uh, baby thing.<br> Did you, uh, ever get this sort of panicky, "Oh, my God, I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing? No.<br> Your mother really did the work.<br> I was busy with the business.<br> I wasn't around that much.<br> Is that what this is about? No, no, Dad.<br> I was just wondering.<br> There's time to make up for that.<br> We can do stuff together.<br> You always wanted to go to colonial Williamsburg.<br> How about we do that? Thanks, Dad.<br> Really, heh.<br> You know, I just, I just I just needed to know, um when did you start to feel like a father? Oh.<br> Well, I guess it must have been the day after you were born.<br> We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep and they brought you in and gave you to me.<br> You were this ugly little red thing.<br> [CHUCKLES] And all of a sudden, you grabbed my finger with your whole fist and you squeezed it so tight.<br> And that's when I knew.<br> So you don't want to go to Williamsburg? We can go to Williamsburg.<br> Eat your fish.<br> [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] [KNOCK ON DOOR] MONICA: Rachel, the cute doctors are here.<br> RACHEL: Okay, coming.<br> Hi, come on in.<br> Hey, Michael, Jeffrey.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> Uh, here, we brought wine.<br> Look at this.<br> It's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine.<br> - So how could we resist? - Oh, that's great.<br> - So, Monica, how's the ankle? - It's, uh [RACHEL CLEARS THROAT] Why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle.<br> You know, it's feeling a lot better.<br> Thank you.<br> Listen, why don't you guys sit down, and we'll get you some glasses.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> - Um - Stat.<br> Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? - I mean, I think it'll be fine.<br> - It will not.<br> We'll get in trouble.<br> Monica, would you stop being such a wuss? A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world.<br> - So? - So they still seem normal.<br> That's because they are.<br> You have to admit, when we go out with women we meet at the hospital Would you relax? Take a look around.<br> There are no pagan altars.<br> No piles of bones in the corners.<br> They're fine.<br> Go like this: I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a big baby.<br> - I am not a baby.<br> - Be serious.<br> - You get uptight - You act like a princess.<br> - You know what? You know what? - What? What? Every day you are becoming more and more like your mother.<br> Excuse me.<br> Hello, here we go.<br> This is a great place.<br> How long have you lived here? Thanks.<br> I've been here about six years.<br> And Rachel moved in a few months ago.<br> See, I was supposed to get married but, um, I left the guy at the altar.<br> - Really? - Yeah.<br> Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but, heh hey, that's me.<br> - Why don't you try the hummus? RACHEL: Ahem.<br> So, Monica, what do you do? Uh, I am a, uh, chef at a restaurant uptown.<br> - Oh, good for you.<br> - Yeah, it is.<br> Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.<br> Well, this hummus is great.<br> God bless the chickpea.<br> [LAUGHING] Oh, God.<br> I am so spoiled.<br> That's it.<br> And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school I was a cow? I used to wet my bed.<br> I use my breasts to get other people's attention.<br> We both do that.<br> [PHONE RINGING] Monica and Rachel's apartment.<br> Uh Uh, yeah, just one second.<br> Uh, Rachel, it's your dad.<br> Hi, Dad.<br> No, no.<br> It's me.<br> Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now.<br> Um But there's something, um There's something that I've been meaning to tell you.<br> Excuse me.<br> Remember back in freshman year?

Your sister stood me up the other night.<br> Oh, no.<br> Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you? - Did you try calling her? - I've been trying for two days.<br> When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk.<br> I can't believe she's blowing me off.<br> Hey.<br> Oh.<br> Um, you got a minute? Um, yeah, I'm just working.<br> - So - Uh-huh?

You know, you'd think I would.<br> [MARCEL GASPING] What's up with the simian? It's just a fur ball.<br> Okay, whose turn is it?
