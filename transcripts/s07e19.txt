                    			Oh, hey! How was your audition? I'm sorry, do I know you? What are you doing? Practicing blowing you off.<br> I'm gonna be a big movie star! You got it? - Not yet, but the audition went great! - What's it for? A big-budget period movie about three Italian brothers who come to America at the turn of the century.<br> It's classy.<br> The director's supposed to be the next-next Martin Scorsese.<br> The "next-next"? A guy from Chicago's supposed to be the next Martin Scorsese.<br> This guy's right after him.<br> Hello? Joey, it's Estelle.<br> I just talked to the casting people.<br> They loved you! They loved me! They want to see you again tomorrow.<br> - My God! -There's just one thing.<br>  Do you have a problem with full-frontal nudity? Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh.<br> Okay, let me call you back.<br> - What's the matter? - They want me naked in the movie.<br> - Wow! - I know.<br> - My grandmother's gonna see this.<br> - Grandma's gonna have to get in line.<br> The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin The wedding's so close.<br> Are you nervous? Yeah, but I also can't wait till it's over.<br> We have a pact not to have sex again until the wedding.<br> A "no sex" pact, huh? I have one of those with every woman in America.<br> Will you give me a hand making up the guest bedroom? Cousin Cassie's staying with us for a few days.<br> Cassie? I haven't seen her in, like, forever.<br> I wonder if she still carries a Barbie everywhere? - She's 25 years old.<br> - So? I still You're probably right.<br> Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second? Subtle, guys.<br> What? I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.<br> Okay, well, don't ruin it.<br> Just play along, at least.<br> Okay.<br> Sorry.<br> We have to throw her a shower? What'd you decide to do about the movie? I don't know.<br> It's not like it's porn.<br> This is a serious, legitimate movie.<br> Nudity's really important to the story.<br> That's what you say about porn.<br> Maybe I shouldn't go on the callback.<br> No, you should.<br> A lot of major actors do nude scenes.<br> The chance to star in a movie? Come on! That's true.<br> And I'm only naked in one scene.<br> It sounds really great.<br> My character's Catholic.<br> He falls in love with a Jewish girl.<br> We run away and get caught in a big rainstorm.<br> We go into a barn, undress each other and hold each other.<br> It's really sweet and tender.<br> Plus, everyone will see your thing! When can we have this shower? She has so much going on, we have only two options.<br> - We have Friday.<br> - That's just two days away.<br> - What is the other option? - Yesterday.<br> If we make it yesterday, we're done! It's impossible.<br> We can't do this by Friday.<br> We have to find a place, invite people, get food.<br> There's too much to do.<br> - We cannot do it! - Calm down! Okay.<br> I'm sorry, you're right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Just calm down, woman! Phoebe, I already did.<br> All right, then I need to calm down.<br> I think we can do this if we just get organized.<br> We have two days to plan this party.<br> We need to make fast decisions.<br> Where will we have it? - Here.<br> What time? - 4:00.<br> Food? - Finger sandwiches and tea.<br> - Great! Very Monica.<br> - And chili! - You went one too far.<br> - Flowers or balloons? - Both.<br> - We're paying for this.<br> - Neither.<br> - What should we do for a theme? - Lusts of the Flesh! - What? - I don't know.<br> Cowboy theme? I'm glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.<br> Oh, boy.<br> Me too.<br> I was thinking, say we had a big fight, and broke up for a few hours.<br> Technically, we could have sex again.<br> What do you think, bossy and domineering? The wedding's off, sloppy and immature.<br> That's me.<br> Come on.<br> Wait.<br> Cassie's in the guest room.<br> We're going to lunch.<br> Get rid of her, obsessive and shrill! Shrill? The wedding is back on.<br> I thought I heard voices.<br> You must be Chandler.<br> - Hi.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> - Nice to meet you too.<br> - So, ready to go? - Yeah.<br> - Chandler? - I'll be right with you.<br> - Cassie needs to stay at your place.<br> - Why? Because "Pervie Perverson" here can't stop staring at her.<br> Chandler, she's our cousin! I wasn't staring.<br> I was listening intently.<br> It's called being a good conversationalist.<br> Watch.<br> Say something.<br> You were staring about eight inches south of there.<br> Fine.<br> She can stay at my place.<br> What does Cassie look like now? Exactly like Aunt Marilyn.<br> This Aunt Marilyn, is she coming to the wedding? Wafer-thin ice.<br> Hey, I'm back.<br> Hi, Joey.<br> Will I read the same scene again? I tried to call you.<br> You didn't need to come today.<br> Oh, great.<br> I'd have been perfect for this part.<br> You made a bad decision and ruined your movie.<br> Good day! You didn't need to come, because the director saw your tape and loved it.<br> End scene.<br> Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there.<br> Yeah! So, you were saying? The director wants to meet you tomorrow.<br> Wow! Sure! That's great.<br> Your agent said you're okay with nudity.<br> Yeah, sure.<br> As long as it's handled tastefully.<br> And that barn is not too cold.<br> Perfect.<br> There's one more thing.<br> It's important to the director that everything in the movie's authentic.<br> In your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.<br> So .<br> So what? So, the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish.<br> You know what I'm saying? Yes! No.<br> What? An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be .<br> Bar mitzvah-ed? - To get this part, you can't be - No.<br> But you are? - You told them you weren't? - That's right.<br> Wow! It's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? - What were you thinking? - I don't know.<br> I just want this part.<br> They say no matter what you're asked during an audition, say yes.<br> They want you to ride a horse, say you can.<br> You figure out how to do it later.<br> This is not like learning to ride a horse.<br> This is like learning to grow a turtleneck.<br> I know, okay? Tomorrow, when I go meet the director I have to take my clothes off so they can see what my body looks like.<br> Oh, my God.<br> What are you gonna do? I have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.<br> Unless .<br> Unless what? This may sound crazy, but there may be something we could fashion.<br> - Like what? - Well, I'm not sure yet.<br> Off the top of my head, I'm thinking double-sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.<br> I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower.<br> We get mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them.<br> Then inside is each person's individual birthstone.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> You take care of that.<br> Meanwhile, the party's tomorrow and we don't have a guest list.<br> Okay.<br> Who do we know that's coming? Me.<br> Are you? - Hey.<br> - Hey, what's up? I'm making something for Joey.<br> Can I raid your fridge? Have at it.<br> All right.<br> Turkey? That won't work.<br> Cheese? That won't work.<br> Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.<br> Are you making him a sandwich? No, it's more like a wrap.<br> Okay, so I'm gonna go, guys.<br> So you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present! We have to get her a present? Okay, but look.<br> Look at what I got.<br> It's her address book.<br> We have a guest list.<br> You're amazing.<br> Did you pull that out of her purse? Uh-huh.<br> And a little seed money for the party.<br> Cassie? Hey, Ross! It's been so long! Last time I saw you you were setting up your tent in line for Return of the Jedi.<br>  So you did see me that day.<br> Because it seemed like you didn't.<br> - Yeah, sorry about that.<br> - It's okay.<br> Come on in.<br> Thanks for letting me stay here.<br> Monica's place was nice.<br> But her fiancÃ© sure stares a lot.<br> Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler! I have a knack for impressions.<br> Maybe after we get re-acquainted you could do me.<br> Yeah.<br> No! How you doing on that hot dog? - I'm all done.<br> - Thank God.<br> The last time we hung out was when our parents rented that beach house.<br> Remember the time I pinned you down and tickled you until you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.<br> I'll always remember that summer.<br> It's when I got all these freckles.<br> I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.<br> It took you that long to figure it out? I'm a little slow.<br> Just as our children would be.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> How are you? Good.<br> Hi.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> Thank you.<br> So nice to see you.<br> - No, thanks.<br> - Okay.<br> Hey, Rach? - Yeah? - Who the hell are all these people? I don't know.<br> I called everybody in her book.<br> These are the ones that could show up on 24 hours' notice.<br> There's a word for people like that: Losers.<br> Hi, I'm Rachel.<br> This is Phoebe.<br> I'm the maid of honor.<br> - How do you know Monica? - I was her accountant four years ago.<br> I'm interested to find out who's been doing her taxes the last four years.<br> That's great.<br> - When is Monica supposed to get here? - I don't know.<br> Excuse us.<br> - You didn't tell her? - You were supposed to.<br> You were supposed to tell her to come! I was bringing the cake! - Fine, I'll go call her.<br> - And please tell her to bring a cake! We have a lot of options.<br> A number of prototypes for you to try on.<br> Those look great.<br> Okay, this one's a mushroom cap.<br> This one is made of bologna.<br> - The toothpicks? - Just until the glue dries.<br> Thank God.<br> These are more realistic, but perishable.<br> Over here, we have pink suede, which is nice.<br> But if it gets wet, it'll shrink.<br> Maybe we'll just take that one away.<br> I also did a little something in fur, but that's really just for me.<br> Why don't you try these on? We'll get a better idea of what works.<br> Thanks, you are such a good friend.<br> And this is so weird.<br> - Toothpick? - Yeah.<br> - What are you trying now? - The Fruit Roll-up.<br> - And? - Delicious.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute.<br> We have a winner! What? Which one? The Silly Putty.<br> Not so silly anymore! She's your cousin.<br>  She's your cousin.<br>  If she knew what was going on in your head, she'd think you were sick.<br>  Or would she?  Let's back up for a second.<br>  She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine.<br>  She was the one who turned down the lights.<br>  She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run  the sexiest movie ever.<br>  I know that look.<br>  Forget it.<br> I want it.<br> She wants it.<br>  I'm going in.<br>  What the hell are you doing? Say something clever.<br>  Okay, doesn't have to be clever.<br>  Just has to be words.<br> Say some words.<br>  Any words will do.<br>  Oh, my God, this is the longest   that anyone has not talked ever!  There is nothing you could say to make this worse   so just say something!  I haven't had sex in a very long time.<br> Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.<br>  Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.<br> I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice? - Oh, Monica.<br> We are so sorry.<br> - For what? First, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.<br> Then, forgetting to invite you to it.<br> You already had it? We called everyone in your phone book.<br> A bunch of people came.<br> It took us so long to get you here that they had to leave.<br> We wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower.<br> Now you don't have either.<br> We ruined everything.<br> No, wait a minute, that's not true.<br> What you did was really sweet.<br> - It kind of works out for the best.<br> - What do you mean? Now I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love.<br> I get all those presents without talking to people I don't even like! - Surprise.<br> - Surprise, Monica.<br> What's cool is, the character is from Naples, right? My whole family's from Naples.<br> That's great.<br> Okay.<br> I've heard everything I need to hear .<br> We just need to, uh .<br> Leslie? - Joey, this is the awkward part.<br> - Hey, right.<br> Not a problem.<br> I totally understand you need to make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos.<br> Don't you worry.<br> I have nothing to hide.<br> So, there you go.<br> That's me.<br> One hundred-percent natural.<br> I tell you, that has never happened before.<br> Cassie, are you finding everything okay? Yeah.<br> Thanks for letting me stay here.<br> Oh, it's no problem.<br> What? Say something.<br> Say anything.<br>  Ask her out! She's not your cousin!    <br>
