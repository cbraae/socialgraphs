Uncanny.<br> Second, that wasn't flirting.<br> That was just casual conversation.<br> Yeah, right.<br> You wanna see flirting? I'll show you.<br> I'm good.<br> The One Where Ross Can't Flirt I am so proud of Joey.<br> -He's gonna be on Law and Order! -I know.<br> Don't you think it should be called Order and Law?

He was hitting on the hot delivery girl.<br> I was not.<br> And oh, God!

You like Caitlin? Ross, we broke up two years ago.<br> You've been married since then.<br> I think it's okay that we see other people.<br> I was watching her at the pizza place.<br> And she was just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little We don't need her measurements.<br> Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.<br> She's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid? She forgot my vegetarian.<br> This is perfect.<br> She'll have to come back here with your pizza.<br> And when she does, I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.<br> I am so glad you don't eat meat.<br> See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.<br> Hey, everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother.<br> -Big night! -Yeah, it's so cool.<br> Joey on Law and Order.<br> You must be proud.<br> She doesn't understand a word of English.<br> I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.<br> I've done it again.<br> Nonnie's my biggest fan.<br> She's the only one in the family who's always believed in me.<br> Si.<br> Big star.<br> My big fat Joey star.<br> Yeah, I weighed, like, -Happy anniversary! -Happy anniversary, 10 months.<br> In the shower I was thinking about our first night in London.<br> Joey's grandmother's right there.<br> -The one who speaks English? -The one who doesn't.<br> That was some hot love you gave me.<br> -I'll get ready.<br> -Wear those earrings I got you.<br> That's a great idea.<br> I was saving them for something special.<br> -You've got to go home.<br> -But I like it here.<br> Get the earrings you borrowed.<br> He wants me to wear them.<br> I think they're in my purse.<br> Go get dressed and I'll look for them.<br> I need those earrings you borrowed.<br> Yeah, I'll be right back.<br> Phoebe, you speak ltalian? I guess so.<br> -Here you go.<br> -Thanks.<br> Where's the other one? Oh, what, you want both of them? That's a little greedy, don't you think? Rachel Karen Greene, where's the other one? Look, just don't freak out, but I kind of lost it.<br> I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.<br> What'll I tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight.<br> -Tell her to wear her own earrings.<br> -These are her earrings.<br> You lent me her earrings? I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff! -Why not? -Because I lose her stuff! You see that blind guy? I'm gonna bash his head in later.<br> My big scene's coming up.<br> The big scene coming up.<br> If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up," would she know the difference? What are you doing? Oh, I just can't watch.<br> It's too scary.<br> It's a diaper commercial.<br> Yeah, well, you know me.<br> Babies, responsibilities.<br> -Pizza delivery.<br> -I'll get it! I will get that! How does my hair look? Ross, it hasn't moved since 1996.<br> One vegetarian pizza.<br> It's 12.<br>50.<br> By the way, if it makes you feel any better I happen to like What? Your hair.<br> Before.<br> Your hair.<br> You said you thought your hair looked like an 8-year-old boy's and I'm just saying I like it.<br> The hair.<br> Thanks.<br> You understand, I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.<br> All I'm looking for is the money.<br> Here you go.<br> Stop bringing us pizzas, you.<br> I'm gonna try.<br> You're welcome.<br> You couldn't let me have her, could you? This is a girl I really like, and you had to swoop in there! What? Chandler was flirting with the hot delivery girl.<br> Thank you for that.<br> I was not flirting.<br> It's okay.<br> I don't care.<br> That's fine.<br> Really? It's no big deal.<br> I do it all the time.<br> You flirt with guys all the time? It doesn't mean anything.<br> Just like it doesn't mean anything with you.<br> There's a difference.<br> You're a lot hotter.<br> True story.<br> This actually bothers you? Yes, and I think it'd bother a lot of people.<br> When you and Ross dated did it bother you when he flirted with other women? No, it bothered me when he slept with other women.<br> And thank you for that.<br> I never had to worry.<br> He was never good at the flirting thing.<br> What are you talking about? It worked with you.<br> No, you're right.<br> We met, you flirted and then bam! Nine years later, you had me.<br> All right.<br> You know what I'll do? I'll order another pizza.<br> And when Caitlin gets here I will show you how well I flirt.<br> I will get her phone number.<br> And not the one on the menu.<br> -I found it.<br> -Thank God! Where was it? On your dresser.<br> Okay, that is the one we already have.<br> Here's my big scene.<br> My big scene's here.<br> -Wanna bet nobody heard anything? -No bet.<br> Anybody home? -Oh, my God.<br> -What? Everybody keep smiling.<br> It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.<br> What is it? They cut me out of the show.<br> What? -Are you sure? -Maybe your scene's coming up.<br> Not likely.<br> Because you see that body bag right there? I'm in it.<br> This is terrible.<br> What'll you do? I don't know.<br> This little old lady lives for my career.<br> When they dumped me off Days of Our Lives, she almost died.<br> That's not good.<br> -Yeah, we had to get her a home nurse.<br> -Oh, my God.<br> Yeah, she almost died and got really expensive.<br> You're not smiling.<br> Not that face! Everybody smile! Just tell her what happened.<br> It's not your fault.<br> If we keep talking this way, won't we freak her out soon? Soon.<br> I'm gonna be on soon.<br> There I am! Sam Waterston! No, no.<br> That's me.<br> That's me! No.<br> Sam Waterston.<br> Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.<br> She doesn't know "hello," but she knows Capricorn One.<br> I need those earrings.<br> We're leaving when the show's over.<br> But I already gave them back to you.<br> No, you didn't.<br> I already didn't gave them back to you.<br> That's what I said.<br> Where's that other earring? It's not here, Phoebe.<br> It's not here.<br> I went to Chandler's last night.<br> Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.<br> Chandler has a jewelry box? We have 10 minutes.<br> Do you want me to get into that now? Hey, Phoebe.<br> How's that vegetarian pizza working out for you? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh? Why are you being weird? Do you like it? No.<br> That'd be, "Why are you being cute?" Okay.<br> I'm working on my flirting.<br> I did not get that.<br> So, Monica, do you like Law and Order? Yeah, it's good.<br> I found out all this stuff about you.<br> You like Law and Order and you've flirted with every guy in the tri-state area.<br> Okay, let me get this straight.<br> It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me? I'm glad we cleared that up.<br> I'm sorry, but some things are different for men and women.<br> Teach me about men and women.<br> I've already taught you so much already, but whatever.<br> When you flirt with a guy, you think, "No big deal.<br>" But he thinks, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me.<br>" -No way! -It's true.<br> -Well, that's pathetic.<br> -Again, true.<br> -This goes for all guys? -All guys that are awake.<br> We go to sleep.<br> All guys from the other end of the world wake up and act the same way.<br> It's another commercial and I still haven't told her.<br> Joey, this is the last commercial.<br> -You got 10 minutes left.<br> -I know! What am I gonna do? You will not run out and leave her here.<br> Yeah, all right.<br> Joey's gonna be right back.<br> Right back? Meanwhile, let's talk about you.<br> So you're old and small.<br> -Did you find it? -The earring, no.<br> But I found my sunglasses.<br> I've been looking for these since last summer.<br> Those are mine.<br> You borrowed them from me.<br> Okay.<br> Calm down.<br> Here they are.<br> -What do we do? -I don't know.<br> I don't know! We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.<br> Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.<br> I could tell her it was all my fault.<br> Oh, that'd be great.<br> Mon, could I talk to you? Yeah.<br> What is it? I lost one of your earrings.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I am so, so sorry.<br> All right, what can you do? If you lost it, you lost it.<br> I'll replace it.<br> I promise.<br> I feel so terrible.<br> That's fine.<br> You didn't do it on purpose.<br> Look at you.<br> Come here.<br> -You feel better? -Yeah.<br> You're the best.<br> Okay, wait a minute.<br> I can't do this.<br> Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.<br> She lent me the earrings.<br> I lost it.<br> I'm so sorry, honey.<br> I feel terrible too.<br> That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff! First, my jewelry.<br> If it's not that, it's my sweater.<br> And if it's not that, it's my sunglasses.<br> Your sunglasses? Oh, right.<br> -Pizza.<br> -Mine, mine, mine!
