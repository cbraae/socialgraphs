                    			Check it out, this is unbelievable! Joey's been holding his breath for almost four minutes.<br> You trying to kill me? I want to ask you something.<br> Since I'm moving out, and you're so beautiful.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>how about I move in with you? That would be great, but what do we do about Denise? -Who's Denise? -My roommate.<br> Your roommate? Yes, Denise.<br> Denise! What is with the secrecy, Phoebe? What about Denise? She cute? How can you have a roommate that we don't know about? Because you never listen to what I say.<br> I talk about her all the time.<br> Denise! I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place.<br> That's true.<br> Move in with me.<br> We can stay up late talking, and watch movies.<br> You know about naked Thursdays, right? Yeah, yeah.<br> I think I'll find my own place.<br> Hey! I thought naked Thursdays was just our thing, man.<br> The One With Ross' Denial Gelula/SDI What did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her? Oh, that.<br> She took it really well.<br> -You didn't tell her, did you? -No.<br> Because you're in love with her.<br> I am not in love with her.<br> She was upset about having to move out.<br> If she knew we were still married, she'd have been more upset.<br> So I comforted her.<br> As a friend.<br> You "comforted her"? Nothing.<br> I just gave her a hug.<br> A classic sign of love, the hug.<br> It's also a sign of friendship.<br> Not in your case, "Lovey Loverson.<br> " It was a hug.<br> Did you, or did you not, smell her hair? Smell her hair? What if I did? Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out of her head.<br> That's why women are shorter.<br> So that men will fall in love when they hug them.<br> Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.<br> I was hugging her as a friend.<br> It's not my fault her hair got in my face.<br> She's got a lot of it, and it smells all.<br> .<br> .<br>all.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>coconutty.<br> What? It doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel.<br> Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts.<br> Okay, but be careful.<br> Rachel's not in the same place you are.<br> If the place you're referring to is being in love.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she is in the same place as me, because I am not in that place.<br> I didn't understand that.<br> Maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love.<br> -A guy just called for you.<br> -Who was it? I don't know.<br> How about "Thanks for taking the message"? When you move in.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Rachel's room will be empty.<br> Let's talk about what to do with it.<br> I think we should have a beautiful guest room.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with fresh flowers.<br> And comment cards so people could tell us how great their stay was.<br> I really haven't thought about it that much.<br> Well, I like that idea.<br> .<br> .<br>obviously.<br> I was thinking maybe.<br> .<br> .<br> maybe it could be a game room.<br> You can buy old arcade games, like Space lnvaders and Asteroids.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>for $200.<br> The real ones.<br> The big, big, big ones! No.<br> You mean "No" as in: "What an interesting idea.<br> Let's discuss it before we reject it.<br> " I'm sorry.<br> Interesting idea.<br> But no.<br> So that's it? I just don't think arcade games go in a beautiful guest room.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>filled with antiques.<br> Which is why Asteroids is perfect.<br> It's the oldest game.<br> What's wrong with a beautiful guest room? I'm not against it.<br> Especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away.<br> Are you mocking me? No, I'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room.<br> Monica and I had a stupid fight.<br> You're still moving in together, right? My ad came out today.<br> "Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly.<br> " Nice.<br> I figured it'd be more interesting to have a female roommate.<br> Someone I could learn from.<br> Someone who's different than me.<br> And what's more different than me, a guy who's not 1 9.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>than a girl who is 1 9? Not just a hatrack, my friend.<br> Pheebs, I have to ask you-- I'm swamped right now.<br> You're just staring into space.<br> I'm trying to move that pencil.<br> -This one? -It worked! Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.<br> Anything I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak.<br> Look.<br> "Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly.<br> " There's nothing.<br> This city is full.<br> Wait! Look at this! "Two bedroom, two bath.<br> Must be nonsmoker.<br> Satan worshipers okay.<br> " Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.<br> -Rach, you still looking for a place? -Yeah, why? This guy, Warren, from the museum is going on a dig for two years.<br> He's got this great place he needs to sublet.<br> You interested? Great! I'd love to live at Warren's.<br> I love Warren! -Thank you! -Don't thank me.<br> Thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>killing, but perfectly preserving, an entire civilization.<br> Here's Warren's number.<br> This is great.<br> I'm gonna call him right now! Thank you! Okay, you go call him.<br> I saw it.<br> What are you talking about? I'm talking about what you already know but won't admit.<br> You love her again.<br> You re-love her.<br> I do not re-love her.<br> I can't believe you won't just admit it.<br> Promise me you won't do anything stupid.<br> We're just friends now.<br> Why would I do anything stupid? The apartment is already subletted.<br> It's hopeless.<br> I'll never find anything.<br> Live with me.<br> -What? -What?! What? Are you serious? I would love to live with you.<br> That's great.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm just glad I could help you out.<br> Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.<br> This is so, so, not stupid.<br> Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.<br> I was gonna be homeless.<br> You just saved me.<br> You're my hero.<br> Hero? I don't know.<br> Well, all right.<br> I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.<br> Oh, please.<br> You're gonna say things now, aren't you? No.<br> No, I won't.<br> But I should tell you this.<br> The same thing happened to my roommate, Denise.<br> She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her.<br> He said he didn't love her, but he really did.<br> And it just blew up.<br> And that's how she ended up living with me.<br> Okay, that's a lie.<br> Listen, I'm sorry about before.<br> I don't need a game room.<br> I only played those games because I couldn't get girls.<br> Now I can get-- Now I have you.<br> No, not that I think I have you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or think of you as property in any sort of way.<br> I see women.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Stop it, Chandler.<br> I'm sorry too.<br> -Really? -Yeah.<br> Oh, yes.<br> We can think of something to do with the room together.<br> Great idea.<br> We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.<br> Totally.<br> -We don't have to decide now.<br> -Good.<br> Let's think about changes we can make in the living room.<br> Changes? We'll have to move some furniture to make room for my chair.<br> You're bringing the Barcalounger over here? Is that a problem? It's just that they're a set and should stay together.<br> That's cool.<br> I'll bring them both over.<br> You're taking them away from their home.<br> I get it.<br> I get nothing.<br> Nothing here is mine.<br> Everything is yours.<br> I'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes and go off to work! Yeah, that's it.<br> Everything will be mine.<br> Nothing will be yours.<br> I'm talking about the Barcalounger.<br> It doesn't match.<br> Where will it go? In the game room! It is not my fault your chairs are incredibly ugly.<br> That's fine.<br> I won't bring the chairs.<br> I won't bring anything! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place! Everything on your application looks really good.<br> Just one last question.<br> Will your friends be over here, partying and hanging out? Don't worry.<br> I'm not a party girl.<br> Don't just be blurting stuff out.<br> I want you to really think about your answers.<br> Call off the roommate search.<br> Hi.<br> I'll be living here.<br> Ignore him.<br> He's just some guy who wants the apartment.<br> But he's not going to get it.<br> You took down the shower curtain? That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.<br> I was just clearing some space for your stuff.<br> Thanks.<br> But listen, Monica and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.<br> What do you mean, not moving in? They're still moving in, right? No, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.<br> Over a stupid room? I feel kind of bad for them, but now I don't have to move in here! Oh, no.<br> Yeah, that part's great.<br> What's all this about you guys fighting? Is this really over a room? That is so silly.<br> We can handle this.<br> Apparently not.<br> And I can't stand by and watch two people I care about so much.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>be hurt by something that is so silly.<br> Enough of the silliness.<br> Tell her to stop being silly.<br> Two very good points.<br> I've known you both a long time.<br> And I've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>as you've been since you got together.<br> Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly.<br> What's more important, love.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or silliness? Well, we are fond of the silliness.<br> But we also have a soft spot for the love.<br> -Love is the best medicine.<br> -That's "Iaughter.<br> " -Why do you do it? -I don't know.<br> Now, Chandler, you want to live with Monica, right? Yeah, I do.<br> And, Mon, you want to live with Chandler? Yes.<br> A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! So I understand you're looking for a place? No, I'm staying put.<br> I was going to offer you my apartment.<br> Why? Where you going? I don't know.<br> You won't believe it.<br> Monica and Chandler are moving in again.<br> That's great news, right? I mean, for them, right? But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.<br> Yeah.<br> You know, about that.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but don't you think it'll be weird? Why? Why would it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Why would it be weird? Well, you know, because of us.<br> Because of our history.<br> No! No, no! It would only be weird if we were still in "that place.<br> " Are you still in that place? No, not at all.<br> Good.<br> Me neither.<br> So it's not a problem.<br> We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.<br> Okay, but eventually you and I will be dating.<br> Really? We are? Yeah.<br> I'll have a boyfriend and you'll have a girlfriend.<br> That'd be great.<br> But if you think it'll be okay, we'll just work out a system.<br> It'll be like in college.<br> I'll hang a sign on the door: "Come back later.<br> I'm getting lucky.<br> " Yeah, I didn't think of that.<br> So are you sure about this whole moving-in thing? It's a really big step.<br> And what's the rush? That's very funny.<br> He's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness.<br> No, I'm serious.<br> Think about it.<br> You move in.<br> You start fighting over game rooms.<br> Next thing you know, you break up.<br> It was just a stupid fight about a room.<br> There are no stupid fights! This isn't about the room.<br> This is about what the room represents.<br> And unfortunately, this room could destroy you! -I'm not so worried.<br> -Me neither.<br> Fine.<br> It's your life! I just don't want to see you break up.<br> Which you will do if you move in together.<br> But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do.<br> Don't do it! -You still want to move in together? -Of course.<br> Ross didn't scare you? Scared me out of wanting to live with him.<br> -I gotta show you something.<br> -Okay.<br> Oh, my God! Someone's killed Square Man! The Barcalounger can go here.<br> You can see the TV, and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.<br> Oh, that's so sweet.<br> I want to show you something too.<br> You know those big road signs that say "merge"? I thought we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed.<br> Because that's you and I together.<br> "Merge! " -I love that! -Really? "No! " I found you in my bed How'd you wind up there? You are a mystery Little black curly hair Little black, little black, little black Little black curly hair If you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>please give me money so I can buy a computer.<br> Where are the other guys? Well, Monica and Chandler are occupied.<br> -Fighting? -The other thing.<br> It's great they worked things out.<br> There's no breaking them up, is there? Can I borrow the key to your house so I can go make a copy? -Here.<br> -Thank you.<br> Are you sure? Once I make a copy, there's no turning back.<br> Yeah, I'm sure.<br> Now get out of here before I change my mind.<br> You think moving in with Rachel is a good idea? I've been back and forth.<br> Well, maybe you should go back.<br> She moves in, and before you know it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you're right where you don't want to be, back together.<br> I don't think so.<br> She's already talking about dating other guys.<br> That's not going to work out.<br> She'll come home all weepy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you'll be telling her, "Oh, that's okay.<br> You'll find someone.<br> " And then, bam! She finds you! Maybe you're right.<br> Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.<br> Is that what you want? Is that what I want? Yes.<br> Here she comes.<br> I'm gonna make your life much easier.<br> The place was closed, so I'll copy it later.<br> Or not.<br> Why don't you move in with me? Whoa, Joey! Look, I know I scared you with that whole naked-Thursdays thing.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but we don't have to do that.<br> It would be easier to move across the hall.<br> Unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays.<br> Thursday's clearly not good for you.<br> Pick a day! Come on in.<br> Thanks for coming back.<br> There's a lot of people interested in the room.<br> But I've narrowed it down, and you're one of the finalists.<br> Before I decide, I want to be sure our personalities match.<br> So I made up a little test.<br> I'll say a word, and you say the first thing that comes to mind.<br> -I can do that.<br> -Okay, here we go.<br> -Pillow.<br> -Fight.<br> Very good.<br> "G.<br> " -String? -Excellent! Doggy.<br> Kitten? Sorry! So close, though.<br> Bye-bye!   <br>
