Have you written your vows? I figured I'd just buy those.<br> "Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.<br> " You know I've no sense of humor when it comes to this.<br> - Right.<br> Have you written yours yet? - No, but I know what I'm gonna say.<br> Do you happen to know what I'm gonna say? Let's do it now.<br> It won't be hard.<br> Say what's in your heart.<br> Look at her go.<br> She must love me more than I love her!  What's wrong with me?  Oh, don 't open that door.<br>  The One with the Vows "Monica, there are no words" There are no words! This shouldn't be this hard! You've done this before.<br> What did you say in your vows? With Carol I promised never to love another woman until I die.<br> She made no such promise.<br> I'm pathetic.<br> Monica knows what to say, you should have seen her.<br> What's the emergency? You have to help me write my vows.<br> All I have is this.<br> I like the pretty drawing of you in the wedding dress.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Except your breasts look small.<br> Those are my eyes! - Those are my breasts.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Why don't you start with something simple? "Monica, from the moment I met you I knew I loved you.<br> " I can't do that.<br> Everyone, this is Chandler.<br> Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, okay.<br> Maybe you could start with: "Chandler, even though we were friends there was a part of me that knew I wanted more.<br> " All right, there's a nuclear holocaust.<br> I'm the last man on Earth.<br> Would you go out with me? Are we allowed to lie in the vows? Okay, don't talk about those feelings.<br> Just say something about all the things he's taught you, like Or all the things you taught him.<br> Everybody knows the erogenous zones.<br> One, two, three four, five, six and seven.<br> There are seven? - That's one? - Kind of an important one.<br> I was looking at it upside down.<br> You know, sometimes that helps.<br> Okay, start out with a little one a two, a one-two-three a three, a five a four, a three-two two, a two-four-six.<br> Two-four-six, four, two two, four-seven five-seven, six-seven seven, seven seven, seven, seven seven! How about something like: "Monica, when I look back over our time together .<br> " - Yeah? - I can't do all of it.<br> Look back over your time together.<br> Oh, look, twins! No fair! I don't even have one, how come they get two? - You'll get one.<br> - Yeah, when? When we're 40, if neither of us are married what do you say we have one? - Why wouldn't I be married? I just meant hypothetically.<br> Hypothetically, why won't I be married? No, no.<br> What is it? Is there something unmarriable about me? Well? Dear God, this parachute is a knapsack! I'm getting married today! Think he knew I was here? Nice try.<br> Wait, wait, wait.<br> Look, Monica - This is not gonna work.<br> - I bet this'll work.<br> You are so great! I love you.<br> What? I said you're so great, and then I stopped talking.<br> - You said you love me! - No, I didn't.<br> - Yes, you did.<br> - No, I didn't! - You love me! - No, I don't! Stop it! Stop it! You know, I was thinking, what if I unpack here? Then all your stuff would be here.<br> Well .<br> What if it was here? Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.<br> Doesn't make any sense.<br> Okay.<br> What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying? We wanted to surprise you.<br> Oh, my God! Chandler in all my life I never thought I'd be so lucky as to fall in love with my best My best There's a reason why girls don't do this! Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.<br> I thought I can do this.<br> I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it.<br> Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you You make me happier than I ever thought I could be.<br> And if you let me I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.<br> Monica?
