                    			Monica, which of all of this kitchen stuff is mine? This bottle opener.<br> -And.<br> .<br> .<br>? -And it's a magnet.<br> Look at that! How weird is that? You're moving in with me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you have the one thing I don't have.<br> It's like, in a way, you complete me.<br> -Kitchen.<br> -What? You complete me kitchen, matey! I know what you're thinking.<br> That she'll move in with you, then fall in love with you, and then.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>when she finds out you're already married, she'll be happy.<br> You know? You're just very sad.<br> Oh, my God! I see what this is.<br> You are in love with Rachel! It all adds up! You're obsessed with her.<br> It's always: "What will you do about Rachel? Why are you moving in with Rachel? When will you confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her! Saved by the bell.<br> Aren't these candlesticks mine? No, I bought those.<br> Oh, right.<br> I forgot.<br> That you're a liar! That's great! I'll be there Monday.<br> And thank you again.<br> That was the head of the paleontology department.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>at N.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Y.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>U.<br> Wow.<br> What.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>did he.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>say? Remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate? -They loved it.<br> -Well, who wouldn't? I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer.<br> It's temporary, but if they like me, it could lead to a full-time job.<br> How great would that look on the mailbox? Professor Geller.<br> Professor and Mrs.<br> And Mrs.<br>? You and Ross are still married.<br> What? Just kidding! Oh, God! Saved your ass.<br> The One Where Joey Loses His lnsurance Gelula/SDI What's the matter? You know that psychic I see? She told me I'm gonna die this week, so I'm bummed.<br> I know you don't know about readings, but that's the worst you can get.<br> That's crazy.<br> She'd say that to you? You don't believe her, do you? I don't know.<br> She said that I'd have triplets.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but she also said one of them would be black.<br> Just out of curiosity, did she say how you'd go? She didn't tell me I'd die till the end of the session.<br> I wasn't gonna waste a whole other hour there! I've only got a week left.<br> I've really gotta start living now! Hey, everyone.<br> Well, today's my first lecture.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I wanted to try it out on you guys.<br> Do you mind? No, that'd be great! "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.<br> Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two.<br> .<br> .<br> " This is it.<br> This is what's gonna kill me.<br> " .<br> .<br> .<br>subcategories.<br> The first of these subcategories is--" Are there naked chicks on that piece of paper? No.<br> Why? I never seen a guy stare so hard at something that didn't have chicks on it.<br> "There are three primary theories.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>concerning sediment flow rate.<br> Each of these theories.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>can be further subcategorized.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>into--" Why don't you open with a joke? Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club.<br> Wait a minute, hold the phone.<br> You're not talking about Chuckles University? Come on, we're kidding.<br> You know what might make it less boring? Thank you.<br> Some visual aids.<br> -You know what's a good visual aid? -Don't say naked chicks.<br> Why not? I don't even know why I talk to you guys about it.<br> I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.<br> That's the way I did it till I was 1 9.<br> Any good mail? Something from the Screen Actors Guild.<br> It's probably a residual check.<br> Can you open it? I got.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> "Benefits lapsed.<br> " That's weird.<br> I don't remember being in a movie called Benefits Lapsed.<br> It's not a check.<br> Your health insurance expired because.<br> .<br> .<br> -.<br> .<br> .<br>you didn't work enough last year.<br> -Let me see that.<br> Oh, I can't believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance, I could get hit by a bus.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or catch on fire, you know? And it wouldn't matter.<br> Now I gotta be careful? I'm sorry.<br> There's never a good time to have to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>stop catching on fire.<br> All right, well.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I guess I gotta go see my agent.<br> Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.<br> "Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.<br> " Hey, you're still alive! How are you feeling? It's so exhausting, waiting for death.<br> Oh, by the way, do you think you-- What are you doing? Preparing you for-- Didn't you think I was dead? Did that not come off? Yeah, scared the hell out of me.<br> I thought we'd lost you forever.<br> -You wanna lie down? -Yeah, thanks.<br> Can you do me a favor? Wake me up in a couple hours.<br> You know, if you can.<br> Did you take these back? I liked them so much that I bought some for myself.<br> They're really great, aren't they? I love them.<br> Nice try.<br> How'd the lecture go? It went great.<br> And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either.<br> That's great.<br> I'm sorry we weren't supportive before.<br> I knew I just had to let the material speak for itself.<br> Everyone's all, "Ross, you have to be funny and sexy.<br> " Well, I proved them wrong! And now I'm gonna pass the news on to Joey and Chandler.<br> -That you're not funny or sexy? -That's right! -Hey, Estelle, listen-- -Well, well, well.<br> Joey Tribbiani.<br> So you came back, huh? They think they can do better, but they all.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>come crawling back to Estelle.<br> What are you talking about? I never left you.<br> You've always been my agent.<br> Really? Oh, well, no harm no foul.<br> Look, you gotta get me some work.<br> I lost my health insurance.<br> All right, first thing we gotta do: damage control.<br> -Why? -Well, I think.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>someone out there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>may have been bad-mouthing you all over town.<br> The bastard! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow.<br> And I'll have my health insurance back in no time.<br> That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now? What's wrong with you? Nothing.<br> I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before.<br> And then I passed out.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I haven't been able to stand up since.<br> But I don't think it's anything serious.<br> This sounds like a hernia.<br> Go to the doctor.<br> No way.<br> If I go to the doctor, it'll be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! That's a hernia.<br> Why'd I have to start working out again? Damn you, 1 5s! The lecture doesn't end for 1 5 minutes.<br> -We can sneak in and watch.<br> -Good.<br> Oh, hey, look! There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.<br> I was a Kappa.<br> Hey, sisters! Wow, we really are bitches.<br> Right.<br> So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he made a startling discovery.<br> What he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary.<br> Imagine his consternation when-- Oh, bloody hell.<br> What the hell are you doing? Look, I was nervous.<br> You guys had me all worried I was gonna be boring.<br> I got up there and they were all, like, staring at me.<br> I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.<br> Yeah, and not a very good one.<br> Will you, please.<br> .<br> .<br>? Dr.<br> Geller? Kurt Rathman.<br> I'm a paleontology professor here.<br> Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture? I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.<br> Monica Geller.<br> Right.<br> Will you excuse us for one moment? -What are you doing? -You can have an accent, but I can't? Top of the morning to you, laddies! Would you just please stop? Yes, yes, Bombay is very, very nice this time of year.<br> Hey, will you grab me a cruller? Sit down! Will you go to the hospital? Hernia operations cost.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>a lot probably, okay? Besides, it's getting darker and more painful.<br> That means it's healing.<br> Look, I'll loan you the money.<br> Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>pushed back in.<br> Thank you, but it'd take me forever to pay you back.<br> I don't want that hanging over my head.<br> Besides, when my insurance kicks in.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I can get all the free operations I want.<br> I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.<br> What's going on? Joey's got a hernia, but it's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix.<br> I'm telling you, if I put my hand on my stomach.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it doesn't hurt that bad.<br> Hey, maybe you'll die! Chandler, I'm scared.<br> No, we can go together.<br> Just don't wait too long, because I'm out of here sometime before Friday.<br> But I don't want to die.<br> It'll be fun.<br> We'll come back and haunt these guys! -Give me them! -No, they are mine! -You stole them from me! -You stole them from me! Give me them! Just wanna each take one? Yeah, that seems fair.<br> We never use them.<br> Look, I really need some help, okay? Why did I have to speak in a British accent? What do I do? Why don't you phase it out? Yeah, phase the accent out.<br> People will think you're adjusting to life in America.<br> Come on.<br> No one will even notice.<br> They're probably not even listening to you.<br> They're not listening to me? Of course they're listening to you.<br> Everybody listens to you.<br> Monica, do you think I should try this phasing-out thing? I think you look fine.<br> Whenever you're ready.<br> Hey, Timmy.<br> I've got a surprise.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>for you.<br> Hold it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> The surprise is a new swing set.<br> If you could play it less intense.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Sure, no problem.<br> Just hold on one second.<br> Hey, Timmy.<br> I've got a surprise for you! Oh, my God! So that's why I feed my dog Purina One.<br> Pick up a bag today.<br> -That's where you pick up the bag.<br> -Exactly.<br> The line is, "Pick up a bag," so you need to pick up the bag.<br> Or I could just point to it.<br> Purina One.<br> Point to a bag today.<br> I didn't get it, did l? Joey Tribbiani.<br> I'm here to audition for "Man.<br> " You mean "Dying Man.<br> " -Do it one more time.<br> -Really? Really? Okay.<br> Hello, Ross? This is Dr.<br> McNeely from the Fake Accent University.<br> We'd like you to come onboard full-time! Listen to this! My reading was wrong.<br> I'm not going to die.<br> Really? How do you know? My psychic is dead! She must have read the cards wrong.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Better her than me.<br> Hey, let's bake cookies! Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.<br> Are you sure you can do this? And thanks for coming with me.<br> And thanks again for helping me take a shower.<br> Now, is that "never talking about it again"? We're ready for you.<br> This is Alex.<br> He'll be playing your son.<br> Hi, Alex.<br> As you can see, my hands are not in my pants.<br> All right, Alex.<br> Now, when Joey says his line.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> "Take good care of your mama, son," that's your cue to cry.<br> Got it? All right, let's do this.<br> Scene five, take one.<br> And action! Take good care of your mama, son.<br> Take good care of your mama, son.<br> Come on, son.<br> Your mama's good people.<br> Cut! Alex, remember, you're supposed to cry.<br> Can you cry for us this time? All right.<br> From the top.<br> Scene five, take two.<br> Take 36 is up.<br> Let's try this again.<br> You ready, Joe? One thing, is it all right if I scream.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>right up until you say, "Action"? Sure.<br> -Action! -Take good care of your mama, son.<br> Cut! I'm sorry.<br> Why don't you lift up your shirt? Take a look at this, kiddo.<br> We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras! -Hello, is Ross there? -No, he's not.<br> Can I take a message? Yes, this is Russell, Ross ' divorce lawyer.<br> Since I haven't heard from him, I assume he's giving the marriage a try.<br> Ross got married again? All right, keep going.<br> We are phasing the accent out.<br> Phasing it out.<br> "So without retesting their results in the laboratory.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the team would never have identified.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the initial errors in their carbon dating.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>analysis.<br> " Were there any questions at this point? What's happening to your accent? Come again? What's this nonsense? All right.<br> I'm not English.<br> I'm from Long lsland.<br> I was really nervous, and the accent.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>just came out.<br> I'm sorry.<br> So if we could just get back to the lecture.<br> Were there any questions? About paleontology? I was just trying to make a good first impression.<br> Obviously, I screwed up.<br> But what you guys think of me is important.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.<br> So if you'd just give me another chance to make a good impression-- Ross! Are you crazy? I am still your wife? Were you just never gonna tell me? What the hell is wrong with you? I could just kill you! Well, hello, Rachel! You've really done this before? You just take a big, big swing, okay? Now, don't hold back.<br> What are you doing? We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.<br> Oh, all right.<br>   <br>
