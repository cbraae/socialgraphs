                    			-Hey.<br> Who wants French toast? -I'll have some.<br> Me too.<br> Eggs and milk in the fridge.<br> Thanks.<br> -What's the matter? -My hand feels weird.<br> I guess it's because I'm engaged! -When will that start getting annoying? -Start? Let's start the wedding plans.<br> -Okay.<br> -Already? We got a lot to do.<br> We gotta think about the flowers, the music-- -I have thoughts on the music.<br> -Too many cooks.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Take it from me.<br> All you have to do is show up and say the right name.<br> -What in God's name is that? -Oh, my God, the wedding book? I haven't seen that since 4th grade.<br> This baby has everything.<br> Take, you know, locations for instance: First organized alphabetically, then geographically.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then by square footage.<br> That is so smart.<br> Break it off.<br> Break it off, now.<br> The One With Rachel's Book Gelula/SDI That conclusively proves.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first.<br> Let's take a look-- Phoebe, what are you doing here? I need to talk to you.<br> It's urgent.<br> It's about Monica and Chandler.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Of course.<br> Would you please excuse me for a moment? Do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you.<br> .<br> .<br>? What's going on? Well, not much.<br> I was just thinking that since they just got engaged.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it would be nice if they have privacy.<br> So could I just move in with you for a couple days? Okay, sure.<br> But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler? Nothing.<br> Why? Phoebe, you said it was urgent.<br> Yeah, it is.<br> My movie starts in five minutes.<br> Do you realize I have a classroom full of students? Oh, I'm sorry.<br> I'm so rude.<br> Does anyone want to come to the movie? I haven't cleared the budget with my parents.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but tell me how this is for music.<br> A string quartet for the processional, a jazz trio for cocktails.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the Bay City Rollers for dancing.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Wait, that was for my 6th grade wedding.<br> You couldn't get them anyway.<br> Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Derek is a name I shouldn't know.<br> Mon, do you have another pillow, something a little snugglier? Why are you napping here instead of at your place? -The duck.<br> -What, the duck? What the hell did the damn duck do now? Well, he did not get sick somewhere in there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up.<br> Do I get to look at this book.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or is it just for people involved in the wedding? Of course you can look at it.<br> I want your opinion.<br> Here you go.<br> -What about centerpieces? -Centerpieces! -Roses or lilies? -Definitely roses.<br> I think they're more "wedding-y.<br> " -But lilies are the clear choice.<br> -Oh, my God, it's like one mind.<br> Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.<br> I'm gonna get cranky.<br> Joey, there's a perfectly good couch across the hall.<br> Yes, it is perfectly good.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it is not one of the places the duck got sick.<br> What? -All right, I'm gonna go.<br> -Joey, what did the duck do? I don't know, but he did not eat your face cream.<br> Hey, little buddy.<br> How you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft.<br> Pillowcases! "Zelda looked at the chimney sweep.<br> Her father, the vicar--" Vicar? "--wouldn 't be home for hours.<br> Her loins were burning.<br> She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his--" This is a dirty book! Phoebe? Oh, Ross, hi.<br> -Phoebe, what are you doing? -Sorry, I'm with a client right now.<br> -Phoebe! -Okay, let's talk outside.<br> Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment.<br> I did it at Monica and Chandler's.<br> And they knew about it? Okay, Ross, what is this really about? This is my home, and I want to be able to come and go when I want.<br> I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments.<br> I don't know what the big deal is.<br> I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>when I want to kick back with a puzzle-- Beer, cold beer.<br> Hey, Joey.<br> What are you doing? Sweeping.<br> Why? Does it turn you on? No.<br> What if I was sweeping a chimney? Joey, did you eat my face cream? Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.<br> Joey, where did you learn that word? Where do you think.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Zelda? -You found my book?! -Yeah, I did! Joey, what are you doing going into my bedroom? I'm sorry.<br> I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn! You know what? I don't care.<br> I'm not ashamed of my book.<br> There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica.<br> It's a healthy expression of female sexuality.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>which, by the way, is something that you will never understand.<br> You got porn.<br> -Hello.<br> -Hi, is Phoebe here? -No, she's out for the night.<br> -Oh, great! Can I help you with something? I don't know.<br> Are you a masseur? Yes, I am.<br> Great! Dad? Thank you so much.<br> I'll pick him up in an hour.<br> Your parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I should probably call them.<br> I remember when we first got engaged.<br> -I've never heard that story.<br> -Dad, you don't-- Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.<br> I still don't know how.<br> You don't know how? Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.<br> What a sweet story.<br> At least you're not hearing it at your 5th grade Halloween party.<br> They wanted a scary story.<br> We're really excited about our wedding plans.<br> Pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the wedding fund.<br> -What? -You tell her, Jack.<br> I can't do it.<br> You have the wedding fund, don't you? We have it.<br> Only now we call it "the beach house.<br> " You spent my wedding fund on the beach house? We're sorry.<br> We assumed.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that when you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.<br> You bought the beach house when I was 23.<br> So you've had seven years of beach fun.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you can't put a price on that.<br> We do feel bad about this.<br> We saved again when you dated Richard.<br> Then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.<br> What about Chandler? It was Chandler.<br> We didn't think he'd propose.<br> I didn't start drinking enough at the start of the meal.<br> I can't believe there's no money for my wedding.<br> Maybe, if your father hadn't tried.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to sell ice over the lnternet.<br> -It seemed like such a simple idea.<br> -Stupid.<br> The word is "stupid.<br> " Enough.<br> I don't want to hear about it anymore.<br> Good luck, Chandler.<br> Okay, now I'm going to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>touch you.<br> That's soft.<br> Do you think your parents could help pay for it? I don't know.<br> My mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.<br> Saving the rest for her divorce.<br> And any extra cash my father has, he saves for his yearly trips to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Dollywood.<br> -What happened at dinner? -My parents spent the wedding fund.<br> My God, what did you order? Wait, there's no money? Well, this is terrible.<br> You guys will have to get married in, like, a rec center.<br> -Honey, it's gonna be okay.<br> -No, it's not gonna be okay.<br> -No swing band, no lilies.<br> -It's gonna be okay.<br> I mean, you don't need to have this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>rustic ltalian feast.<br> You don't need this custom-made.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>empire waist, duchess satin gown.<br> You can wear off-the-rack.<br> It's really gonna be okay.<br> The important thing is, we love each other and we're gonna get married.<br> Do you even understand what "off-the-rack" means? Why don't you pay for it yourself? How? I don't have any money.<br> -I have some.<br> -How much? Well, close to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -Are you kidding me?! -How much? -Enough for wedding scenario A.<br> -Really? How great are you, you little saver! This is exactly the budget of my dream wedding.<br> You guys are so made for each other.<br> You're not suggesting we spend all the money on the wedding? Yeah.<br> Look, Mon, I've been saving this money for six years.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I have some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.<br> Wow! Hello, Mr.<br> Chandler.<br> Sweetie, this is the most special day of our lives.<br> I realize that, honey, but I won't spend all the money on one party.<br> Honey, I love you.<br> But if you call our wedding a party one more time.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you may not get invited.<br> We can always earn more money.<br> We're only gonna get married once.<br> I understand, but I have to put my foot down.<br> The answer is no.<br> You're gonna have to put your foot down? Yes, I am.<br> Money and a firm hand.<br> Finally a Chandler I can get onboard with.<br> CENTRAL PERK -Hey, Rach.<br> -Joey.<br> Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke? I get it.<br> Smoke, chimney, chimney sweep.<br> Very funny.<br> Ha, ha.<br> No, no, I'm serious.<br> You don't smell it? Something's on fire.<br> I don't smell anything.<br> You know what? It's probably just your burning loins.<br> -Hey, what are you guys talking about? -Nothing.<br> Damn, this coffee's cold.<br> Do you mind if I heat this on your loins? You know, I cannot believe you told him.<br> Joey.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I guess you bought that book after we broke up.<br> I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.<br> Oh, yeah? Well, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines.<br> 'Sup? Ross, how could you do that to an old man? Excuse me, ladies.<br> I'm sorry? My massage client.<br> Arthur.<br> His daughter said some guy that worked for me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>gave him a really weird massage.<br> I gave him an extremely professional massage.<br> He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.<br> Okay, so it wasn't a traditional massage.<br> But I did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I gently exfoliated him with a mop.<br> Well, he's never coming back.<br> You just cost me $80 a week.<br> This is your fault.<br> You didn't move his appointment.<br> Oh, it's my fault? You didn't have to massage him.<br> You could've sent him away.<br> You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back.<br> He said he liked that! You're right, you're right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Dude, what are you massaging an old man for? -His daughter was hot.<br> -Gotcha.<br> Listen.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I've been thinking.<br> It's not fair of me to ask you to spend all your money on our wedding.<br> I mean, you work really hard for that.<br> -Well.<br> -Well, you work for that.<br> Look, I've thought about it too.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I think we should spend all the money on the wedding.<br> -You do? -Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.<br> Look, when I proposed, I told you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I would do anything to make you happy.<br> And if having the perfect wedding makes you happy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>then that's what we're gonna do.<br> You are so sweet.<br> What about the future and stuff? Forget about the future and stuff.<br> So we only have two kids.<br> We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.<br> -Have you thought about that? -Yeah.<br> How many kids were we gonna have? Four.<br> A boy, twin girls and another boy.<br> What else did you think about? Well, stuff like where we'd live, you know.<br> Like a small place outside the city.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>where our kids could learn to ride their bikes.<br> We could have a cat that had a bell on its collar.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.<br> We'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.<br> You know what? I don't want a big, fancy wedding.<br> -Sure you do.<br> -No.<br> I want everything that you've just said.<br> I want a marriage.<br> You sure? -I love you so much.<br> -I love you.<br> When you were talking about our future, you said cat.<br> But you meant dog, right? -Totally.<br> -Good.<br> Hello, Zelda.<br> -Who are you supposed to be? -The vicar.<br> -Do you even know what a vicar is? -Like a goalie, right? Look, that's enough.<br> You make stupid jokes and sleazy innuendoes.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it's just not funny anymore.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Rach, I'm sorry.<br> Maybe I could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn.<br> All right, that's it.<br> You want to do it? Let's do it.<br> That's right.<br> I want to do it with you.<br> Been trying to fight it, but you said all the right things.<br> I did? Yeah, I been waiting for so long to get on that body.<br> -This body? -Yeah, that's right.<br> Come on, Joey, sex me up.<br> You're starting to sound like the butcher's wife in chapter seven.<br> Come on, now.<br> Don't keep me waiting.<br> Take your clothes off.<br> But I'd keep that helmet on, because you're in for a rough ride.<br> I don't want to.<br> I'm scared.<br>   <br>
