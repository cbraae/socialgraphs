                    			Did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back? Oh, my God! Let me see that.<br> You fall for it every time.<br> Hey! I brought you my old maternity clothes.<br> Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.<br> Oh, those are so cute! Look.<br> See how they expand as the baby grows? And after the baby's born they're great for shoplifting melons.<br> Good, you're all here.<br> Thanksgiving, 4:00.<br> Guess who I invited? Remember Will Culvert from high school? - No.<br> - He was in Ross' class.<br> Marching band, was kind of overweight.<br> Really overweight.<br> I was his thin friend.<br> I don't remember.<br> Are you talking about your imaginary boyfriend? No, that was Jared.<br> Wow.<br> Haven't thought about him in a long time.<br> Will's here on business so I invited him here.<br> - That's nice.<br> - Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.<br> He looks good.<br> Okay, I mean really gorgeous.<br> - I still love Chandler.<br> - Wouldn't hurt you to say it.<br> Just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey.<br> - What? - Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.<br> - Phoebe! - Turkeys are intelligent animals.<br> No, they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious! It's not just Phoebe.<br> Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food and Rachel has her poultry aversion.<br> I had to leave when you had that chicken.<br> I thought that was because I put it on my hand and made it walk.<br> It's not worth it to make a whole turkey.<br> It's a lot of work.<br> But you gotta have turkey! Thanksgiving with no turkey is like Fourth of July with no pie.<br> Or Friday with no two pizzas.<br> Fine.<br> But there's gonna be a ton left over.<br> No, I will finish that turkey.<br> You can eat almost an entire turkey in one sitting? That's right.<br> Because I'm a Tribbiani! This is what we do.<br> We may not be great thinkers or world leaders we don't read a lot or run fast, but damn it, we can eat! The One With the Rumor mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Four wide receivers.<br> On third and 18.<br> Isn't it weird how next year there will be a baby at the table? Rachel's.<br> But good to know where you're at.<br> - Hey! - Hey! - Happy Thanksgiving.<br> - You too! - Can I help? - Yes.<br> Chandler usually helps but he's into the game.<br> Could you fold these napkins? I'm gonna go check on the yams.<br> No, sweetie.<br> No, not like that.<br> We're not at a barn dance.<br> Fold them like swans.<br> I showed you at Christmas.<br> Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.<br> - So how's the game? - I have no idea.<br> - What? - I'm pretending to watch so I don't have to help out.<br> I don't believe you! That is brilliant! - And Monica has no idea? - No.<br> I just yell stuff at the TV.<br> 'Ey! What? 'Ey! - Your team winning? - Anderson just scored again.<br> There is no Anderson.<br> I wanna get in on this.<br> Hey, Mon? I can't help you.<br> I didn't realize this game was on.<br> - You like football? - Normally, I don't.<br> But, you know, Green Bay is playing.<br> - You like Green Bay? - It's only my favorite bay.<br> - Happy Thanksgiving.<br> - Will, I'm so glad that you came.<br> You must've lost Subway commercials.<br> - A pie! - It's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.<br> - It's no good.<br> Throw it out.<br> - Meet some people.<br> This is my husband, Chandler.<br> This is Will.<br> Oh, hey.<br> I'd shake your hand but I'm really into the game.<br> Plus, it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand together.<br> - This is Phoebe.<br> - Hi.<br> Hey.<br> Wow! Well done.<br> - Wanna give me a hand? - I can't get over how great you look.<br> - You too.<br> You're so fit.<br> - I'm watching but I'm not deaf.<br> - I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.<br> - Great, I love Ross.<br> Good.<br> And Rachel Greene too.<br> - Is there a problem? - No.<br> It's okay.<br> It's just God, I hated her.<br> - What? - I hated her.<br> She was horrible to me in high school.<br> But hey, that was a long time ago.<br> Might be fun to see her again.<br> Got any cakes or cookies or something? No, Will! No! It's been a while since we screamed.<br> - Oh, okay.<br> No! - Come on! Damn you, ref! You burn in hell! What are you doing? You've got an entire turkey to eat.<br> Let me explain to you how the human body works.<br> I have to warm up my stomach first.<br> - Eating chips is like stretching.<br> - Okay.<br> - Tribbianis never get full.<br> - I'm here to tell you something.<br> You can eat and eat, but nothing will ever fill that void.<br> - Who the hell is this guy? - This is Will, from high school.<br> - Will! - Ross! Hey, you came! Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff! - Hot stuff? - It's good to see you, man.<br> Yeah.<br> You too.<br> So, what are you up to? - I'm a commodities broker.<br> - That sounds interesting.<br> - Yeah, it's not.<br> - Oh.<br> - But I'm rich and thin.<br> - Oh.<br> I haven't seen you since Lance Davis' graduation party.<br> That was such a fun night.<br> Would've been good if we had gotten in, but still fun.<br> We were lame.<br> Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were? - Yeah.<br> - So, what do you do now? So how long are you in town? - Hi.<br> - Hey, sweetie.<br> Oh, good.<br> Rachel Greene.<br> Oh, that's right.<br> Are you gonna be okay? Oh, I'll be fine.<br> It's just God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her! High school was a long time ago.<br> Look at her standing there with those yams.<br> My two greatest enemies: Rachel Greene and complex carbohydrates.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Who is that? - That's Will, from high school.<br> - Oh! I do not remember him.<br> Wow, really got that sexy smoldering thing going on.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Look at the way he's just staring at me.<br> He's trying to mouth something to me.<br> I hate you! - Okay, dinner's ready! - Okay! - Solid effort.<br> Solid effort.<br> - Oh, so who won? - Green Bay.<br> - Detroit.<br> - What? - The Lions technically won.<br> But it was a moral victory for the Green Bay Mermen.<br> Hi! Will, right? Right, hi.<br> I'm Rachel Greene.<br> - Oh, I remember you.<br> - Really? Aren't you sweet? I gotta tell you, I'm having the hardest time placing you.<br> Hang on! I think I remember you.<br> Did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party? - You are unbelievable.<br> - Thank you.<br> Rachel? Why don't you sit here? And Will, you sit way over there.<br> That's it? I can eat that, no problem.<br> - At least give me a challenge.<br> - This is Chandler's chicken.<br> This is the turkey.<br> Oh.<br> How big is that? - About 19 pounds.<br> - It's like me when I was born.<br> - Who would like some yams? Will? - You'd like that, wouldn't you? What? Oh, can we please keep the chicken and the turkey on the other side? - The smell is just - Typical.<br> - What? - I said it was typical.<br> Typical of you.<br> Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in Rachel-land.<br> Seriously, who is this guy? Sorry, do you have a problem with me? - I don't know.<br> Do I? Do I? - I think you do.<br> You were mean to him in high school.<br> - You made my life miserable.<br> - I had no idea.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Well, you should be.<br> Screw it.<br> Bring on the yams.<br> But you worked so hard.<br> - Yams! - Okay.<br> I'm real sorry for whatever I did to you in high school.<br> It wasn't just me.<br> We had a club.<br> - You had a club? - The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"! So you all just joined together to hate me? - Who else was in this club? - Me and Ross.<br> No need to point.<br> She knows who Ross is.<br> - You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club? - Yes, he was.<br> No, no.<br> - So who else was in this club? - That exchange student from Thailand.<br> But I don't think he knew what it was.<br> We went out for two years and you never told me? You went out with her? We had a pact.<br> - It's not like it was binding forever.<br> - It had the word "eternity" in it.<br> Monica? Did you know about this? I didn't.<br> Is that why you used to lock the bedroom door? - Yeah.<br> - A little relieved, I gotta say.<br> Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay? I was a stupid kid, okay? - The only reason I joined - Cofounded.<br> Cofounded the club, was that I was in love with you.<br> If you think about it, the "I Hate Rachel Club" was really the "I Love Rachel Club.<br>" But it was really the "I Hate Rachel Club.<br>" So you'd get together and say mean things about me? - We did a little more than that.<br> - No, no, no.<br> What else did you do? - We started a rumor.<br> - What rumor? Come on, Will.<br> Take off your shirt and tell us.<br> - Ross? - It was no big deal.<br> We said that The rumor was that you had both male and female reproductive parts.<br> - What? - That's right.<br> We said your parents decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.<br> - Oh, my God! - You started that? - You heard that? - Everyone at our school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader? Oh, no! It makes sense.<br> This is why Adam Carter wouldn't go out with me.<br> Why Billy would just stay in this region.<br> Billy's gay now, so that one's not really our fault.<br> - Why didn't you tell me? - I thought it might be true.<br> I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.<br> Stop staring! There's nothing there! It's not true! I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.<br> You are my Everest.<br> - You don't have to finish.<br> - I do.<br> Otherwise, what's next? Today I can't finish a turkey, but tomorrow I eat half a Power Bar wrap it up and put it in the fridge? No! I gotta change my pants.<br> What was I thinking? Jeans have no give.<br> Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year.<br> "Dear Rach, you're such a great person.<br> " Not girl, "person.<br> " I think you're reading a little too much into it.<br> "You're a great person.<br> Sorry about your weenie.<br>" You want me to call everyone and tell them it wasn't true? - Yes.<br> - Also, tell them I'm skinny now.<br> Oh! Me too! I won't call anybody.<br> It was a million years ago.<br> I don't care.<br> You told people that I was half and half! I never did anything to hurt you in high school.<br> That's not totally true.<br> - What? - What? You did start that rumor about Ross making out with Mrs.<br> Altmann, our 50-year-old librarian.<br> How did you know that? - It's true? - No.<br> I saw you going at it behind the card catalog.<br> Mrs.<br> Altmann? She also made out with Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek before he went back to Thailand.<br> In high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman? - Hey, she didn't look 50! - Did she look 16? There's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.<br> - Wow.<br> - She didn't photograph well! She wasn't familiar with the process, having sat for oil paintings.<br> How did this happen? Did she lure you to an early-bird dinner? I was working late in the library.<br> It was just the two of us.<br> She needed some help with her word jumble.<br> And one thing led to another.<br> If you must know, Anita was very gentle and tender.<br> May she rest in peace.<br> - Didn't she walk with a cane? - Only when it was damp! I can't believe you told people about this.<br> Everybody knew? - You know what? I'm back in the club! - Yeah! - I wanna join! - Phoebe? I never got to be in a club.<br> I didn't go to high school.<br> But three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French.<br> Fine, you can have your stupid, little club.<br> But what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you.<br> - You gave me a teeny weenie.<br> - Yeah! You're silly.<br> Even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls.<br> Everyone wanted to be like you.<br> One girl stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.<br> Wow.<br> If it weren't for her rumor, no one would've known who you were.<br> - She put you on the map.<br> - As a romancer of the elderly.<br> Mrs.<br> Altmann used to be pretty.<br> The eyes did still sparkle.<br> This stuff is so way in the past.<br> You've been through so much.<br> You got so much more important stuff going on.<br> Can't you just let this go? - She's right.<br> - We are having a baby together.<br> Hold on.<br> - You got her pregnant? - Yeah.<br> - Are you getting married? - No.<br> So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her.<br> Dude.<br> - Anybody? - Okay.<br> It's exactly how I imagined it would be.<br> All right, where's that turkey? - Those are my maternity pants! - No, these are my Thanksgiving pants! Well, that's it.<br> I'm done.<br> Here come the meat sweats.<br> Well, Joey, we're all very proud of you.<br> I believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now.<br> - Anything we can do? - Just nobody press on my stomach.<br> You can keep those pants, by the way.<br> What you got there? What is that, pie? - You want some? - Just cut me a little sliver.<br> Little bigger.<br> Little bigger.<br> What are you afraid of? Cut me a real piece!   <br>
