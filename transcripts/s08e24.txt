Okay, I have one.<br> If you had to, which would you eat? A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> My foot itches like crazy.<br> Oh.<br> I'll get it.<br> I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.<br> Relax.<br> It's not like we're forking.<br> Oh, that's five, Ross.<br> Five women have had five babies and I have had no babies.<br> Why doesn't she want to come out?

Okay.<br> Okay.<br> L Okay.<br> I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.<br> If it, you know, if it helps, you came off great.<br> A lot better than I'm coming off right now.<br> I don't believe this.<br> You had him pretend he was a fake doctor? Fake? Excuse me? Hello? - You tried making me think I was crazy? - That was wrong.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> It's just that I liked you so much.<br> Can we just start over? I don't think so.<br> If I may? You told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?

Oh, I could squeeze your little head.<br> I won't.<br> - Honey, what's the matter? - Nothing.<br> I just can't stop crying.<br> The doctor said it's normal, plus you're sleep-deprived.<br> You guys are all sleep-deprived.<br> I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.<br> Oh, God.<br> - What's the matter now? - I was reliving it.<br> Do you know what you're gonna call her yet? Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original.<br> Actually, we've narrowed it down to two.<br> And you know what? I love them both.<br> So just pick one, and that'll be it.<br> Wow, okay.<br> Everyone? This is Isabella.<br> - Hi, Isabella! - Hi.<br> What? That's not her name.<br> I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.<br> - What was the other one? - Delilah.<br> Oh, great! At least she sounds like a biblical whore.<br> So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.<br> What will we do? - You'll find a name.<br> - Easy for you to say.<br> You know what your kids' names will be.<br> - You do? - I had them picked out since I was 14.<br> Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it? - Well, tell us, what are they? - Okay.<br> If it's a boy, it's Daniel.<br> - And if it's a girl? - I don't want to say.<br> Oh, stop.<br> Tell us.<br> We're not gonna want it.<br> Okay.<br> It's Emma.<br> Emma.<br> See, I don't want it.<br> - Take it.<br> - What? She's clearly an Emma.<br> Oh, honey, but you love that name.<br> Yeah.<br> But I love you more.<br> Besides, nothing goes with Bing.<br> So I'm screwed.<br> Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.<br> Oh.<br> Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he? He's a keeper.<br> - How are you feeling? - Oh, I'm fine.<br> I really admire what you're doing.<br> Just raising her all alone.<br> I'm not doing it alone.<br> I have Ross.<br> Sure.<br> Now.<br> But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married? Well, then he gets a divorce.<br> It's Ross.<br> I'm telling you.<br> Listen to Janice.<br> They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.<br> - That's never gonna happen with Ross.<br> - That's what I thought.<br> I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father and little Miss New Boobs.<br> Really? I hate to be the one to say it but, honey, you two are on your own.<br> Well, that's, you know, that's We've been alone for the last Maybe we won't be alone.<br> Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross.<br> And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss.<br> You know? So it might be the beginning of something.<br> - Hey, Janice.<br> - Oh, hi.<br> Who's this little guy? - Aaron, your future son-in-law.<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> - I'm gonna leave you three alone.<br> - Okay.<br> Man, you see the kid on that nose? You know what I was thinking about? That kiss before we left the apartment.<br> That was something, huh? Yeah.<br> Yeah, it really was.<br> But we, we gotta be careful.<br> We You know, we can't let that happen again, you know? Right.<br> - We don't want to go down that road.<br> - No.<br> That's why I brought it up.<br> - They didn't have any sodas? - Oh, my God.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I was talking to this nurse.<br> Completely forgot.<br> And so it begins.<br> She in there? Yeah.<br> She's putting her down now.<br> That's her.<br> - Look at Emma.<br> - I can't decide who she looks like.<br> Oh, what, are you kidding? She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.<br> I'm sorry.<br> For the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know.<br> Because you're not in that place.<br> Which would be fine, except you totally are.<br> It's complicated, okay? You love her, you always have, you have a child together.<br> There's no right answer.<br> Look, we've been together.<br> Then apart.<br> Then together, then apart.<br> And now we have a baby.<br> It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out? I could never do that to Emma.<br> I mean, she came into this world thinking everything Now me.<br> What, do they put something in the water here? It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well now.<br> I know.<br> If you try to make it more, you might wreck it.<br> - Yeah, exactly.<br> - Right.<br> Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.<br> Hey.<br> I saw a woman breastfeeding twins at the same time.<br> It is like a freak show up here.<br> - What's the matter? - Nothing.<br> What is it? Hey? - Really, it's nothing.<br> I'm - Rach, come on.<br> What? I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.<br> What are you talking about? What about Ross? Please.<br> He'll be with his real family.<br> The twins and little Miss New Boobs.<br> Okay, how long was I watching that woman? I'm just saying that, you know someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and he's gonna have his own life.<br> Right? Yeah, I guess so.<br> I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.<br> That's pretty dumb, huh? Hey, you listen to me.<br> Listen to me.<br> You are never, ever gonna be alone.<br> Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.<br> Joey.<br> Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you? You don't have to worry about that, okay? Could you grab me my other box of tissues? - They're under Ross' coat.<br> - Sure.<br> Oh, my God! Joey? Oh, my God.<br> Okay.<br> - That was amazing.<br> - I know.<br> Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have started our family.<br> In nine months we could be here having our own baby.<br> And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.<br>   <br>
