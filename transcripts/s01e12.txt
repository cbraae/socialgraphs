Nice! Come on, Pheebs.<br> Well, it looks like we kicked your butts.<br> She did.<br> You could be on the Olympic "Standing There" team.<br> Come on.<br> Two on one.<br> Why are you here? She just broke up with him.<br> It's time for you to swoop in.<br> -What, now? -Yes.<br> Now is when you swoop.<br> When Paolo walks out, you gotta be the first guy she sees.<br> She's gotta know you' re everything he's not.<br> You' re the anti-Paolo.<br> My Catholic friend is right.<br> She's distraught.<br> You' re there for her.<br> You pick up the pieces and then you usher in "The Age of Ross.<br> " -See this? See? -Hold it! Ascolta! -How's it going? -Don't stare.<br> She threw his clothes off the balcony.<br> Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.<br> That is, " How could you? " or " Enormous breasts! " Here he comes.<br> I am to say goodbye.<br> Okay, bye-bye.<br> Paolo, I really hate you for what you did, but I still have five of these so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.<br> I just wanna tell you, and I think I'd speak for everyone when I say.<br> Oh, just look at her.<br> Guys, I think only one of us should go -so she's not overwhelmed.<br> -Right.<br> And I really think it should be me.<br> You all right? I've been better.<br> I don't believe this.<br> I wasn't supposed to care about this guy.<br> It was just supposed to be this big, fun, ltalian thing.<br> Someday I could look back and say, "That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.<br> " It wasn't supposed to feel like this when it was over.<br> Come here.<br> Listen you deserve so much better than him.<br> I mean, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.<br> What? I' m so sick of guys! I don't want to look at or think about another guy.<br> I don't even want to be near another guy.<br> Ross, you' re so great.<br> -Are you all right? -Are you okay? -Medium.<br> Any cookies left? -Yeah.<br> See, Rach  I don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer.<br> What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.<br> I just need to be by myself for a while.<br> -I just gotta figure out what I want.<br> -No, no.<br> See, because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo.<br> No, I know.<br> I know.<br> And l' m sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.<br> -What? -What? I' m having a boy? No.<br> No.<br> In fact, you' re not having a boy.<br> I' m having a boy.<br> -Huh? Am I having a boy? -You' re having a boy! I' m having a boy! -l' m having a boy! -What is it? I' m having a boy! I' m having a boy! We already knew that! I' m having a son.<br> Yes! And that would be a shutdown! Shutout! Where you going? One more game! -It's 2:30 in the morning.<br> -Yeah, get out! You guys always hang out in my apartment.<br> I'll only use my left hand.<br> Come on, wussies! All right! Okay! I gotta go!
