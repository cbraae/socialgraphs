You can always spot someone who's never seen his one of his plays before.<br> Notice, no fear.<br> No sense of impending doom.<br> "The role of man number three will not be played by Vic Shapiro.<br> " We came on the wrong night.<br> I can't believe I forgot to bring a magazine.<br> -Come on you guys, this might be good.<br> -I don't know.<br> The exclamation point scares me.<br> It's not just Freud, it's Freud! Magic is about to happen! Well, Eva we've done some excellent work here.<br> And I would have to say your problem is quite clear.<br> All you want is a dinkle What you envy's a schwang A thing through which you can tinkle To play with or simply let hang The One With the Butt I feel violated.<br> Did anybody else feel like peeling their skin off to have something else to do? Ross, 1 0:00.<br> Is it? It feels like 2.<br> -No, 1 0:00! -What? There's a beautiful woman at 8, 9, 1 0:00! Hello! She's amazing! She makes the women l dream about look like fat, bald men.<br> Go over.<br> She's not with anyone.<br> And what would my opening line be? Excuse me.<br> Come on, she's a person.<br> You can do it.<br> Could she be more out of my league? Back me up.<br> He couldn't get a woman like that in a million years.<br> You always see these beautiful women with "nothing" guys.<br> You could be one of those guys.<br> -You could do that.<br> -You think? Absolutely! I can't believe I'm considering this.<br> -l' m very aware of my tongue.<br> -Come on.<br> Here goes.<br> Stand back, everyone.<br> Incoming ego shrapnel.<br> All right, I can do this.<br> -Yes? -Hi.<br> Okay, next word would be  Chandler.<br> Chandler is my name and.<br> Hi! Yes, you said that.<br> Yes! Yes, I did.<br> But what I didn't say.<br> What I wanted to say was would you like to go out with me? Thank you.<br> Good night.<br> Chandler? -I didn't know you could dance! -You were in a play! What'd you think? -I didn't know you could dance! -You were in a play! It wasn't that bad.<br> I was the lead.<br> It was better than the troll thing.<br> At least you got to see my head.<br> -You're right.<br> -We saw your head.<br> How about that accent? Yeah.<br> All of your W's were V's.<br> She said yes! Awful play, man! Her name's Aurora.<br> She's ltalian and she pronounces my name " Chandler.<br> " I like that better.<br> The usher gave me this.<br> -What is it? -The Estelle Leonard T alent Agency.<br> An agency left its card.<br> They wanna sign me! Based on this play? Based on this play! Look! There's a note on the back.<br> "Loved your work.<br> Call me a sap.<br> " She was obviously very moved! You should call her fairly quickly.<br> Yeah! As soon as possible! Come in! Hi.<br> I'm here to see Estelle Leonard.<br> Just a moment, let me see if she's in.<br> Hello.<br> -You' re Estelle? -I know you weren't expecting someone so fantastically beautiful.<br> Love lump.<br> T ake a load off already, darling.<br> Sit already.<br> I can't tell you how excited I am to be here.<br> Why not? -What I meant was -You don't mind if I eat, do you? Joey sweetheart, let me ask you a question.<br> Did you ever see the movie Sleepless in Seattle? -Wow! Do you represent those actors? -No.<br> But you know the end, where they' re happy? That's gonna be you and me.<br> You mean you wanna sign me? No, I wanna go to the top of the Empire State Building and make out.<br> Of course I wanna sign you! -Miss Leonard, I'm so -Oh, boy.<br> -Ride them, cowboy.<br> -l' m sorry! I don't see it! -T ry to look through it.<br> -Unfocus your eyes.<br> Focus? There's nothing to focus on.<br> -It's the Statue of Liberty! -Right! -Where's the Statue of Liberty? -There.<br> I can't not see it now.<br> Hey, kids! Come here.<br> Do you see anything here? -lt looks like a boat.<br> -A boat.<br> Right in front of the Statue of Liberty.<br> It's been seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went.<br> How was your date, Chandler? It was unbelievable! I've never met anyone like her.<br> She's had an amazing life! She was in the Israeli army.<br> None of the bullets hit the engine, so we made it to the border.<br> But just barely, and l.<br> I've been talking about myself all night long.<br> I'm sorry.<br> What about you? T ell me a story.<br> All right, once  I got on the subway.<br> And it was at night and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn.<br> Just for the hell of it.<br> We talked until 2:00.<br> It was perfect.<br> More or less.<br> Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen.<br> I' m sorry, so "we" is? "We" is me and Rick.<br> Who's Rick? Who's Rick? My husband.<br> -Oh, so you' re divorced? -No.<br> I' m sorry.<br> So you' re widowed? Hopefully? No, l' m still married.<br> So, how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me sliding your foot so far up my leg you can count the change in my pocket? Don't worry.<br> He'd be okay with you because he's okay with Ethan.<br> Ethan? There's an Ethan? Ethan is my boyfriend.<br> What? What kind of relationship do you imagine us having if you have a husband and a boyfriend? I suppose, mainly sexual.<br> Sorry it didn't work out.<br> What, not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday.<br> Didn't you listen to the story? Didn't you listen? It's twisted! How could you get involved with her? I had trouble with it at first.<br> But I get the good stuff.<br> All the fun, all the talking, all the sex and none of the responsibility.<br> -This is every guy's fantasy! -That's not true! -Ross, is this your fantasy? -No, of course not.<br> Yeah.<br> Yeah, it is.<br> You'd go out with someone going out with someone else? -I couldn't.<br> -Good for you.<br> When l' m with a woman, I need to know  I' m going out with more people than her.<br> Once, I went out with a guy who just got divorced.<br> It was hard.<br> His kids liked me better than him.<br> What does this have to do with Chandler? Nothing.<br> I didn't have anything on that topic.<br> So I went another way.<br> You know, monogamy can be a tricky concept.<br> I mean, anthropologically speaking Fine.<br> Now you'll never know.<br> We' re kidding.<br> T ell us.<br> -We wanna know.<br> -Come on! All right.<br> There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey Are we greeting each other this way now? I like it.<br> Look! I cleaned! I did the windows.<br> I did the floors.<br> I used all the vacuum attachments but the round one.<br> What's it for? Nobody knows.<br> And we're not supposed to ask.<br> What do you think? -It's very clean.<br> -Really, it looks great! I see you moved the green ottoman.<br> How did that happen? I don't know.<br> It looked better there.<br> And it's an extra seat around the table.<br> Yeah, it's interesting.<br> But you know what? Just for fun Iet's see what it looked like in the old spot.<br> Just to compare.<br> Let's see.<br> Well, it looks good there too.<br> Let's leave it there for a while.<br> I can't believe you moved the green ottoman.<br> Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.<br> She'll scratch your eyes out.<br> -You guys, I am not that bad! -Yeah, you are.<br> Remember, I lived with you? You were a little.<br> That is so unfair! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.<br> Okay, so I'm responsible.<br> I'm organized.<br> But hey, I can be a kook! All right, you madcap gal! Imagine this.<br> The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.<br> -Why not? -Because you're a kook! You wait until they send a notice.<br> I could do that.<br> Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping -No problem.<br> -I'm not done yet.<br> And I buy detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.<br> Why would someone do that? One might wonder.<br> But I would be fine with that.<br> A glass is on the table with no coaster.<br> A cold drink.<br> A hot day.<br> Beads of condensation are inching closer to the wood.<br> Stop it! Oh, my God! It's true.<br> Who am l? Monica, you' re Mom.<br> Oh, my God! Okay, I'll be there.<br> That was my agent.<br> My agent has just gotten me a job in the new Al Pacino movie! -That's great! -What's the part? Can you believe it? Pacino! This guy's why I became an actor! " Out of order? You' re out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order! " Seriously, what's the part? "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in! " Come on.<br> Seriously, Joey, what's the part? You' re.<br> What? I' m his butt double, okay? I play Al Pacino's butt.<br> All right? He goes into the shower, and then  I' m his butt.<br> Oh, my God! Come on, you guys.<br> It's a real Pacino movie and that's big! It's terrific.<br> You deserve this.<br> After years of struggling you've cracked your way into show business.<br> Fine.<br> Make jokes, I don't care.<br> -This is a big break for me! -You' re right.<br> It is.<br> So, will you invite us to the big opening? -I need some moisturizer.<br> -For what? T oday's the big day! You got any tweezers? I think I have a rogue hair.<br> God.<br> Go in the bathroom.<br> Use whatever you want.<br> Don't ever tell me what you did in there.<br> Thank you.<br> -Joey's mom's on the phone.<br> -ln the bathroom.<br> -You don't wanna go in there! -Come on, we' re roommates.<br> My eyes! My eyes! I warned you.<br> Who is being loud? Oh, that would be Monica.<br> Can I borrow stuff? I wanna make Aurora breakfast.<br> You got the whole night? Well, I only have 20 minutes until Ethan, so.<br> Do I sense resentment? No.<br> No resentment.<br> Believe me it's worth it, okay? In a relationship, you have moments you'll remember the rest of your life.<br> Every single second is like that with Aurora.<br> I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you.<br> So, Monica, can you help me with the door? The old Monica would remind you to scrub that T eflon pan with a plastic brush.<br> But l' m not gonna do that.<br> Excuse me? Can they warm it up? I' m concerned about goose bumps.<br> Everybody ready? I wanna thank you for this opportunity.<br> I mean, I know this is just a first step, but I hope that someday Lose the robe.<br> Right.<br> Okay.<br> Losing the robe! Okay, and the robe is lost.<br> I would like to get this in one take.<br> Let's roll it.<br> Water's working.<br> And action! And cut! Butt guy, what are you doing? I'm showering.<br> No, that was clenching.<br> The way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know? His wife's dead, his brother's missing.<br> I think his butt would be angry here.<br> I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch.<br> Once again, rolling.<br> Water working.<br> And action! And cut! What was that? I was going for quiet desperation.<br> But if you have to ask.<br> God, I love these fingers.<br> Thank you.<br> No, actually, I meant my fingers.<br> Look at them.<br> Look at how happy they are.<br> -Oh, my God, l' m late! -Oh, no! -Don't go.<br> -Okay.<br> -I have to.<br> -Look, she's leaving.<br> I' m sorry.<br> He'll be waiting for me.<br> -I thought you talked to Rick.<br> -It's not Rick.<br> Ethan? He gets the whole day! No, it's Andrew.<br> I know there'll be moments when I'll regret asking the following question, but.<br> -And Andrew is? -He's  new.<br> So you' re not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself? No, that's not exactly what I was Most women would kill for three guys like us.<br> -So, what do you want? -You.<br> -You have me.<br> -No.<br> Just you.<br> -What do you mean? -Lose the other guys.<br> Like, all of them? Come on, we' re great together.<br> Why not? Can't we have what we have now? Why can't we talk and make love without feeling obligated to each other? Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.<br> Well, part of me wants that  but it's like l' m two guys.<br> One guy's saying, "This is great! " But there's this other guy.<br> The guy who wells up when the Grinch's heart grows and breaks that measuring device.<br> He's saying, you know, "This is too hard.<br> Get out! " So, which one of the guys will you listen to? I have to listen to both.<br> They don't let each other finish.<br> Which one? The second guy.<br> I see.<br> Call me if you change your mind.<br> Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.<br> Look at it this way.<br> You dumped her! Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable.<br> T ell me why you did this again? Movie star! Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Pacino movie? Nope.<br> No? What happened, big guy? Big guy? It felt like a "big guy" moment.<br> I got fired! They said I acted too much with it.<br> I told everybody about this! -Everybody's expecting to see me.<br> -lKnow what? -No one will be able to tell.<br> -My mom will.<br> There's something so sweet and disturbing about that.<br> I've done crappy plays for six years and I finally get my shot, and I blow it! Maybe this wasn't it.<br> I think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot.<br> Did it feel like your shot? Hard to tell.<br> I was naked.<br> I don't think this was it.<br> I don't think you just get one.<br> I believe things are gonna happen for you.<br> I do.<br> You've got to think about the day some kid will go: "l got the part! I'm gonna be Joey T ribbiani's ass! " You think? That's so nice.<br> I' m sorry, Joey.<br> I' m gonna go to bed, guys.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night.<br> You' re gonna leave your shoes out here? Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless, haphazard manner? It doesn't matter.<br> I'll get them tomorrow.<br> Or not! Whenever.<br> She is a kook.<br> If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.<br> No, don 't do this! This is stupid! I don 't have to prove anything.<br> I'm gonna get them.<br> But then everyone will know.<br> Unless I get them, then wake up really early and put them back.<br> I need help! -All you want is a dinkle -Not that song! -All you envy's a schwang -Come on, you guys.<br> A thing through which you can tinkle Or play with or simply let hang All you want is a dinkle What you envy's a schwang A thing through which you can tinkle Or play with or simply let hang   <br>
