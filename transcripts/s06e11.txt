                    			Listen.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You think I have a chance with Janine? We've been through this.<br> Don't do this to yourself.<br> She made it clear it isn't going to happen.<br> All right, then.<br> I guess I shouldn't get too excited.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I just kissed her! -Are you serious? -That's great! Yeah, well, we'll see.<br> You kissed her? We kissed it up real nice.<br> So you kissed.<br> Then what happened? I came over here to tell you guys.<br> So she's waiting over there for you? Yeah.<br> The One With The Apothecary Table Gelula/SDI -I gotta go.<br> -Okay.<br> I'm gonna be late for dance class.<br> Okay.<br> -Okay, now I'm really leaving.<br> -All right.<br> But can you just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>just leave your lips? Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever.<br> You know what? She kisses better than my mom cooks.<br> I'm so glad you said "cooks.<br> " Rachel, you've got to tell the post office that you've moved.<br> We still get your bills and stuff.<br> Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.<br> I'm not your garbage man.<br> I'm your mailman.<br> Monica, look.<br> Here is that table that I ordered.<br> -You got it from Pottery Barn? -Yeah.<br> It's an apothecary table.<br> Does anyone even know what an apothecary is? A pharmacist.<br> "A pharmacist.<br> " Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.<br> I hate Pottery Barn too.<br> They kicked me out just because I sat on a bed.<br> You took off your pants and got under the sheets.<br> I was tired.<br> Phoebe hates Pottery Barn? She hates mass-produced stuff.<br> She thinks her furniture should have a story behind it.<br> This has a story behind it.<br> They had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.<br> It's got to be one-of-a-kind.<br> Like that God-awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter? Hey! I made that for her.<br> -You made pottery? -Yeah.<br> I made it out of a fruit bowl I found in the garbage.<br> If you put that in her apartment, you'll never hear the end of it.<br> I'll tell her that it's an antique.<br> She doesn't have to know where it came from.<br> I love these little drawers.<br> Oh, look! It says that it holds 300 CDs.<br> Just like the apothecary tables of yore.<br> So the farmer says: "That's not a cow, and you're not milking.<br> " I'm so glad you're together.<br> We wanted a couple to go out with and now we have one.<br> We're a couple of couples.<br> I had so much fun tonight.<br> What a great restaurant! And Chandler, I can't believe I let you pay for this one.<br> Thanks again, man.<br> If you come over tomorrow, I'll make pasta.<br> -That'd be great! -Okay.<br> But at least let us bring the wine.<br> -You don't have to.<br> -I insist.<br> -You'll get the wine, right? -Yeah.<br> -Okay, good night.<br> -See you tomorrow.<br> Can't wait.<br> How are we going to get out of that one? I can't handle two nights in a row with them.<br> What's wrong with them? They're just a little.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>blah! Blah? Well, you know, he's blah.<br> She's just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> She's very loud for such a small person.<br> They're my best friends.<br> Are you saying we can't go out? 'Cause that'd be a problem.<br> Of course we can still hang out with them.<br> Just not two nights in a row.<br> -Okay? -I guess.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.<br> What a great table! Where did you get it? Guess.<br> A flea market? I knew you would get it on the first guess.<br> Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table.<br> You can just imagine that this is where.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they kept all their stuff to make potions.<br> You can almost smell the opium.<br> Almost.<br> How much was it? Just only 500 bucks.<br> I thought you meant how much was it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>when it was new, back then.<br> It was at a flea market, so it was like a dollar.<br> -A dollar? -And fifty? So it was like one and fifty dollars.<br> -They gave you the old-time pricing.<br> -Yeah.<br> Well, what period is it from? It's from yore.<br> Like, the "days of yore," you know? Yes, I do.<br> -It's just perfect.<br> -Oh, good.<br> I bet it has a great story too.<br> Did they tell you where it's from or.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Yes, that I know.<br> This is from White Plains.<br> White Plains.<br> It sounds like such a magical place.<br> -I'm here.<br> -Hi! Oh, my God! -You like it? -Oh, my God! It's my new apothecary table! Phoebe'll be here any second.<br> She can't see this.<br> Why not? She'll love it.<br> It's the real thing.<br> I got it at Pottery Barn.<br> I know.<br> I bought the same one.<br> And if she sees your table, she'll know I lied.<br> -I said ours was an original.<br> -Why? Because she hates Pottery Barn.<br> She hates Pottery Barn? She says it's all mass-produced.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.<br> So come on! Can we cover this up, please? I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.<br> Although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets.<br> I forgot they made sheets! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn.<br> It's not like she hates you.<br> Yeah, but Pottery Barn? You know what I think? She's just weird.<br> It's because she's a twin.<br> Twins are weird.<br> She's not weird.<br> She likes her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.<br> You know what's not one-of-a-kind? A twin! Let's turn out the lights and watch the movie.<br> -Hey, cool sheet! -You like it? -You want to know where I got it? -Sure.<br> At a flea market.<br> You buy your sheets at a flea market? Come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.<br> Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.<br> Here is the wine to bring over tonight.<br> You were also gonna buy Monica flowers.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but you couldn't because you paid for dinner last night.<br> Thanks.<br> But it's just gonna be me tonight.<br> -What happened to Janine? -She's really sick.<br> -That's too bad.<br> -Yeah, she's been in there all day.<br> High fever, nose problem.<br> It's.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.<br> Monica! Chandler! I'm sorry about tonight.<br> I don't know if Joey told you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I couldn't get out of going to this play.<br> Have a great time, huh? That's funny, I saw no phlegm.<br> Oh, no, she really is sick.<br> Then why is she going to a play? Well, you know, "Starve a fever.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>go to a play for a cold.<br> " Why is Janine not coming over for dinner? She didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Why doesn't she want to hang out with us? Because she thinks that you are "blah.<br> " And that you, Monica, are too loud.<br> What?! What? So she just pretended to have a good time? She was lying to our faces? I can't believe this.<br> Who is she to judge us? -We couldn't have been nicer to her.<br> -And I am not "blah.<br> " I am a hoot! Come on, please, you guys.<br> Don't be mad.<br> I'm sure she said it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because she was nervous 'cause you're my best friends.<br> And it was our first date.<br> Plus, she's really sick.<br> You said you made that up! But isn't the "sick" thing better than the "play" thing? They're both good.<br> I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again.<br> " Come on, please just give her another chance.<br> -She'll come around, I promise.<br> -Of course we will.<br> -Come on, we gotta make dinner.<br> -Okay.<br> I do not like that woman! I can hear you! I am loud! Can you please not put your feet up on my new.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>old sheet.<br> Oh, sure.<br> My apothecary table! -What? -No! -Where did you get this? -At Pottery Barn, okay? Oh, my God! Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique! If they've ripped off our table.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>ours must be worth much more than one and fifty dollars.<br> This doesn't even smell like opium.<br> It smells like wine, which you spilled.<br> And thanks for wrecking my sheet.<br> Ross, calm down.<br> I'll give you the 80 cents.<br> Okay, one more time.<br> Would you like some orange juice? -Perfect decibel.<br> -I know! What are you guys doing? Nothing.<br> We're just talking.<br> You know, blah-blah-blah.<br> Come on, you said you were gonna try.<br> I came over to invite you to a movie with me and Janine.<br> -What do you say? -I'd like to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I'm not sure if we have the time.<br> Very funny.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> I really want you to get along.<br> Please, come to the movie with us.<br> You owe me.<br> -We owe you? -That's right.<br> I helped you out in the start of your relationship.<br> I helped you sneak around for six months.<br> I looked like an idiot.<br> And I was humiliated.<br> And I only made $200.<br> We didn't give you any money.<br> You don't think I know that? I can't decide if it goes better by the new chair.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the Sahara desk.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or the Parker console table.<br> I didn't know there was a Pottery Barn up here.<br> -I know, I went a little crazy.<br> -A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalog.<br> Look at that! The ornamental birdcage! Large.<br> Oh, Ross? Be careful.<br> That is very old.<br> Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.<br> Fascinating.<br> Another amazing find! -I bet this has a great story too.<br> -It does.<br> It is a room-separating apparatus from Colonial times.<br> A lot of this stuff is from the Colonial times.<br> What are some other time periods, Rachel? Well, there's yore.<br> And, you know, yesteryear.<br> Rachel has such a good eye for this stuff.<br> Ross, if you ever decide to redecorate-- --and I think you should-- --you should ask Rachel to help.<br> He doesn't need my help.<br> I think he's ready to get rid of the-- What'd you call it? The "cheap knockoffs and dinosaur junk"? Really? You know, since you have such a great sense of what I need-- Here's 60 bucks.<br> Why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and get me some stuff? I don't think Phoebe wants to come.<br> -I do want to.<br> -She does want to.<br> -She does want to.<br> -Yeah! I guess the flea market was just better last time.<br> Well, at least I got these sheets for Ross.<br> Ugh, look at this.<br> Pottery Barn.<br> You know what? Don't look at it.<br> -Seriously, don't look at it.<br> -Look! There's the table they stole from us.<br> Oh, those bastards! Let's go.<br> That fan kind of looks like ours, and the birdcage, and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Wait a second, this is our exact living room! No, it's not.<br> Come on, ours is totally different.<br> I mean, we don't have the-- We don't have that lamp.<br> And that screen is on the other side.<br> Oh, my God.<br> This is where you got all our stuff.<br> Pottery Barn! Oh, my God! Okay, I did, all right? I'm sorry.<br> I wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn.<br> -Come on, don't be mad.<br> -No, but I am mad.<br> Because this stuff is what's wrong with the world.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it's in my living room.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp! Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.<br> We have that 60 bucks from Ross.<br> I can't! I can't! Unless.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Are you saying you'd move out if I didn't buy that lamp? No, I'm not gonna move out! But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp? -Yes! I would so move out.<br> -Then I don't have a choice.<br> -I have to buy that lamp! -That's right.<br> But at least the apothecary table's real.<br> This was great.<br> Didn't everybody have a great time? I did.<br> I really did.<br> And I've got to say.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm sorry if I was weird after the last time we went out.<br> I guess I was just nervous.<br> -That's understandable.<br> -Don't worry about it.<br> So we can go out again? -Absolutely.<br> -Well, good.<br> See? Wasn't that fun? We have got to move.<br> What? I knew it! You're not so quiet yourself, missy! I'm blah? The only thing more boring than modern dance.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is you talking about it.<br> "Oh, Chandler, I just lost myself in the movement.<br> " You know, I know you're talking.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but all I hear is blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.<br> All right, you and me! Let's go, right now! All right, enough! Enough! You two, go home.<br> I gotta talk to Janine.<br> I really think you could take her.<br> You better hope I don't see you in the hallway! All right.<br> Look, we got a little bit of a problem here.<br> You can't my treat my friends that way.<br> -They said stuff to me too.<br> -I know, I'll talk to them about it.<br> They mean so much to me.<br> They're like my family, you know? If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I don't think we can be together.<br> It just can't work, okay? It can't.<br> I'm very upset.<br> Okay.<br> Would it help if I apologized? Yeah.<br> That'd be very helpful.<br> What did I tell you about the hall? I was coming over to apologize for my behavior.<br> I'd really like it if we could be friends.<br> Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I would like that too.<br> -Great.<br> -Now, come on.<br> -I'm glad we worked it out.<br> -Me too.<br> -I'll see you.<br> -Bye.<br> -Or I'll hear you.<br> -That's it, big girl! Wait! You'd better run! Did you hear that? -What am I gonna do? -I'm sorry, man.<br> -Want to go watch? -Yeah! -How you doing? -So did she move out? Pretty much.<br> I can't believe you just broke up with her.<br> When it's not right, you know it.<br> -You okay? -I'll be all right.<br> -You know what'd cheer you up? -What? I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night.<br> I think you should come.<br> You're right, that did cheer me up.<br>   <br>
