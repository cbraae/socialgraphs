                    			He sprang to his sleigh To his team gave a whistle And away they all flew Like the down of a thistle But I heard him exclaim Ere he drove out of sight "Merry Christmas to all And to all a good night.<br> " Wow! That was great! You really wrote that? Say goodbye, elves.<br> I'm off to Tulsa.<br> I can't believe you won't be here for Christmas.<br> You're really not coming back? We have this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year.<br> - Lf I don't get it done, I'll be fired.<br> - It's so unfair.<br> - You don't even like your job.<br> - So.<br> Who does? - I like my job.<br> - I love my job.<br> - I can't wait to go back to work.<br> - I can't get enough dinosaurs.<br> I'm sorry I won't be here.<br> It's hard enough not seeing you during the week but for Christmas If this is what you have to do, I understand.<br> Thanks.<br> I'll see you New Year's Day.<br> You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve? - Did I not mention that? - No.<br> And to all a good night! The One With Christmas in Tulsa mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 All right, everybody.<br> I know it is Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with family, but there is no call for writing "Screw you, Mr.<br> Bing" on the back of my chair.<br> By the way, you can all call me Chandler.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> Where you been? I was checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three.<br> It was really beautiful.<br> They have decorations and this huge tree.<br> And I just thought, to hell with them, we have to work.<br> So I stole their ham.<br> Hear that? You may not be with your families but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.<br> My kid's in a play right now.<br> You know what? I know what will cheer you up.<br> I had a talk with the boys in New York.<br> I told them about all your hard work and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.<br> "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet.<br>" Well, that's like money in your pocket.<br> All right, you want me to say it? This sucks.<br> Being here sucks.<br> This work sucks! Now it feels like Christmas.<br> I'm sorry.<br> At least you get to go home and be with your families tonight.<br> I have to go to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread.<br> Then tomorrow, you get to have Christmas in your own houses.<br> Which, by the way, none of you have invited me to.<br> - You can come to my house.<br> - No, thanks.<br> - It was a nice pep talk.<br> - Thanks.<br> I'm actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.<br> So if you were home right now, what would you be doing? Typical Christmassy stuff, you know.<br> Our holidays are pretty traditional.<br> So here's a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me.<br> Happy holidays, everybody.<br> Pheebs, look in the kitchen.<br> I'll look in the back closet.<br> I can save you time, ladies.<br> I'm right here.<br> Yeah.<br> Chandler, why don't you take a walk.<br> This doesn't concern you.<br> We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.<br> - What? That's terrible.<br> - No, no.<br> We do it every year.<br> Well, that makes it not terrible.<br> No.<br> Yeah, we never find them.<br> She's always bested us, that wily minx.<br> We're gonna search here for an hour and then we'll go to Joey's and search.<br> Okay? No, not okay.<br> You can't look for Monica's presents.<br> - No, we have to.<br> - No, you don't have to.<br> And you can't, because I live here too.<br> - Well, then you should look with us.<br> - Why? Aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas? No, I have a great idea for a present for her.<br> That's it? "A great idea"? That's not enough.<br> What if she gets you a great present two medium presents and lots of little presents and you got her one great present? That's gonna make her feel bad.<br> Why would you do that to her? Why? Why? - Lf I helped, we could find them faster! - Right.<br> - We have a live one! - It's a Macy's bag! Who's it for? "Dear Losers: Do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.<br>S.<br> Chandler, I knew they'd break you.<br>" Rach, these are for you.<br> Wiper blades.<br> I don't even have a car.<br> No, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do.<br> Okay, Pheebs, your turn.<br> Toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas? You guys.<br> And for Ross, Mr.<br> Sweet Tooth.<br> - You got me a cola drink? - And a lemon-lime! Well, this This is too much.<br> I feel like I should get you another sweater.<br> And last but not least They're ribbed, for your pleasure.<br> Well, hey, Ben? What if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights? Cool! Come on, Ben.<br> Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees! Merry Christmas! Santa! What are you doing here, Santa? Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.<br> What are you doing here weird turtle-man? I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend.<br> You sent me here to give Ben some presents.<br> Remember? What? Ben, why don't you open some more presents.<br> Santa, the armadillo and I will have a talk in the kitchen.<br> There's a sentence I never thought I'd say.<br> What are you doing? You called and said you had trouble finding a Santa costume so I borrowed one from a guy at work.<br> Thank you, but you gotta leave.<br> - Why? - Because I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah.<br> And you're wrecking it.<br> But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.<br> I'm sorry, Chandler, but this is really important to me.<br> Okay, fine.<br> I'll give the suit back.<br> Hey, you think you can keep it another night? Santa? Really? - Yeah, is that okay? - Did your dad ever dress up like Santa? - No.<br> - Then it's okay! You know what, everybody? Go home.<br> You should be with your families.<br> It's bad enough we're working New Year's Eve.<br> Did I not tell anyone about New Year's Eve? All right, look, go.<br> Go home, okay? Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Peace on earth.<br> - Bye.<br> - Good.<br> Godspeed, good people.<br> - You're not gonna go? - No.<br> I couldn't leave you alone.<br> Thanks.<br> Besides, I can't leave until that Christmas party downstairs clears out.<br> There are some pissed-off insurance people looking for that ham.<br> - Chandler Bing.<br> - Hi, honey.<br> We're all here.<br> We want to wish you a merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas.<br> I miss you guys.<br> So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard? Well, no, it's just me and Wendy.<br> Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.<br> It is.<br> Did I not tell you about her? About the time you told me about New Year's Eve.<br> - Where's everybody else? - "I sent them home.<br>" You are such a good boss.<br> Is she pretty? Answer faster.<br> Answer faster.<br> - I don't know.<br> - Answer better.<br> Answer better.<br> I don't think of her that way.<br> I mean, she's a colleague.<br> - What does she do there? - She's regional vice president.<br> - She's just below me.<br> - She did what? Below me.<br> Wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma? What?! Well, she didn't win.<br> All right, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.<br> Second prettiest that year.<br> Of all the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably Chandler, stop talking.<br> Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.<br> - Okay.<br> - I'm serious.<br> Okay.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - Merry Christmas, you guys.<br> - Merry Christmas.<br> - The wife says hi.<br> - Fun conversation? Well, she's just got this weird idea that because you and I are alone something's gonna happen.<br> Really? Would that be so terrible? This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about but you're getting ham on my only tie.<br> - Back off, missy! - Missy? I don't know.<br> I'm not used to girls making passes at me.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Am I sexy in Oklahoma? - You are to me.<br> - No.<br> No.<br> No! - Look, I'm married.<br> - So? I'm married.<br> I'm happily married.<br> What's that like? - Right.<br> So I'm sorry, but - Seriously? Happily married? So that phone call before, that was happy? Well, look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart.<br> She's entitled to be a little paranoid.<br> Or, in this case, right on the money.<br> You know, she's amazing and beautiful and smart.<br> And if she were here right now, she'd kick your ass.<br> Look, you're a really nice person, ham-stealing and adultery aside.<br> But what I have with my wife is pretty great.<br> So nothing's ever gonna happen between us.<br> Okay, let me ask you something.<br> If what you and your wife have is so great then why are you spending Christmas with me? You were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.<br> - Really? - Are you kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms.<br> What's going on? You and I just made out.<br> - You and I are making out? - Well, not anymore.<br> - But we don't do that.<br> - I know.<br> I just thought it would be fun.<br> - How drunk are you? - Drunk enough that I wanna do this.<br> Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.<br> That's a perfect amount.<br> - You know what's weird? - What? - This doesn't feel weird.<br> - I know.<br> - You're a really good kisser.<br> - Well, I have kissed over four women.<br> You wanna get under the covers? Okay.<br> Wow, you are really fast.<br> It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.<br> - We're gonna see each other naked.<br> - Yep.<br> - You want to do it at the same time? - Count of three? - One.<br> - Two.<br> Three.<br> Well, I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.<br> We weren't that close anyway.<br> Are you really gonna go out with that nurse-man? Well, you and I are just goofing around.<br> I thought, why not just goof around with him? I don't know if you've ever looked up "goofing around" in the dictionary.<br> Well, I have.<br> And the technical definition is two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together.<br> If you have this newfangled dictionary that gets you mad at me then we have to, you know, get you my original dictionary.<br> I am so bad at this.<br> I think you're better than you think you are.<br> - Really? Okay.<br> So if? - Know when to stop.<br> I sensed that I should stop.<br> - So we're okay? - Yeah.<br> - Don't do the dance.<br> - Right.<br> I can't get married without something old, something new something borrowed, something blue.<br> - Okay, okay.<br> Here's something blue and new.<br> You are so efficient.<br> I love you.<br> - Let's go.<br> - No, no, wait! We need something old.<br> Okay.<br> I have a condom in my wallet that I've had since I was 12.<br> That'll work! I don't think so.<br> Okay.<br> Now we just need something borrowed.<br> - Here, just take this.<br> - That's stealing.<br> We'll bring it back.<br> Just put it under your dress.<br> Okay, one thing at a time.<br> Listen I've been thinking.<br> It's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding.<br> I mean, you work You work really hard for that.<br> - Well - Well, you work for that.<br> Look, I've thought about it too.<br> And I'm sorry.<br> I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.<br> - You do? - Yeah.<br> I'm putting my foot down.<br> Yeah, look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy.<br> And if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then Then that's what we're gonna do.<br> You are so sweet.<br> But wait.<br> What about our? What about the future and stuff? Forget about the future and stuff.<br> So we only have two kids.<br> You know, we'll pick our favorite, and that one will get to go to college.<br> - You've thought about that? - Yeah.<br> - How many kids were we gonna have? - Four.<br> A boy, twin girls and another boy.<br> - What else did you think about? - Well stuff like where we'd live, you know.<br> Like a small place outside the city where our kids could ride bikes and stuff.<br> And we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.<br> We'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.<br> You know what? I don't I don't want a big, fancy wedding.<br> - Sure you do.<br> - No.<br> I want everything that you've just said.<br> I want a marriage.<br> You sure? - I love you so much.<br> - I love you.<br> - I love it! - Really? You're not gonna return it? Well, not this second.<br> Hey, look, you guys.<br> It's snowing! - Wow, it's so beautiful.<br> - Wow, it really is.<br> Wendy's a fat-girl name.<br> Aren't we done with that? Okay, fine.<br> Fine.<br> Let's talk about snow.<br> Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa where my husband's having sex on a copier? - Hey.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> Look at that.<br> That's a Christmas miracle! - What are you doing here? - I wanted to be with you.<br> I missed you so much.<br> - Hey, hey.<br> Who'd you miss the most? - Monica.<br> Gotcha.<br> - I never want to leave you again.<br> - I thought if you left, you'd get fired.<br> Turns out they can't fire me.<br> Because I quit.<br> - What? - What? You? You really quit your job? Yeah.<br> It was a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you.<br> Why should I be the only one who doesn't do what he really wants to do? - Well, what do you really wanna do? - I have not thought this through.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - I know.<br> I should've talked to you first.<br> No, I think that this is what you wanna do.<br> I think it's great! Thanks.<br> Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could ever imagine.<br> - Now give me my real gift.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Here, pass those around.<br> "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet.<br>" How did you know? What? Are you kidding? I can't return this.<br> It's time we started thinking about other people.<br> And besides, this gift still says, "I love you guys.<br>" - Mine says, "To Lillian Myers.<br>" - I don't have a job.<br> Actuary? No.<br> Bookkeeper? No.<br> Topless dancer? Hey, you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner.<br> You are the head of the household.<br> I don't do anything.<br> I'm a kept man! You are.<br> Honey, here's 20 bucks.<br> Go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow.<br>   <br>
