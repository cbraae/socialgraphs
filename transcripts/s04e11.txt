                    			I can't believe my little brother's married! Why didn't you tell me you were eloping? Well, we were at court, eating lunch Why were you at the courthouse? We were having lunch.<br> We were like we're here, we're having lunch.<br> Let's get married! Right? A year ago, I didn't know I had a brother.<br> Now I have a sister! Oh, it's so great.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Stop it! Don't! I'll get you a gift now.<br> Is there anything you need? We've been trying to get pregnant since we got engaged, to get a jump on things.<br> No one's getting any younger.<br> Because the thing is, we're not able to, you know, conceive.<br> We've seen a bunch of doctors.<br> They say that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg, put it together in a dish and put it into another girl.<br> We were wondering if you could be that girl.<br> That's a really nice gift.<br> I was thinking of a gravy boat.<br> We know it's a lot to ask.<br> We don't have anyone else to go to.<br> We could pay someone but we don't have that kind of money.<br> Plus, you know, you're family and, you know I just don't want my baby to grow into some chick I don't know, you know? Don't give us an answer yet, think about it.<br> And if you say no, we'll totally understand.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> And we were wondering if you could give us a ride down to the train station.<br> Well, actually, we kind of need an answer to that one right now.<br> The One with Phoebe's Uterus Check it out! Guess what job I just got.<br> I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.<br> What? Blue blazer back.<br> He wants it back.<br> You said "black.<br>" Why would he want his blue blazer black? Well, you know what I meant.<br> You messed it up.<br> You're stupid.<br> So, what job did you get? Tour guide at the museum.<br> Ross got it for me.<br> Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert? They give you all the information.<br> It's like memorizing a script.<br> On your left you have a tyrannosaurus rex, from the Jurassic Period.<br> Very nice.<br> Yeah, actually, Joey, it's the Cretaceous Period.<br> But I can pronounce Jurassic.<br> Frank Jr.<br> and Alice got married! Oh, my God! They're having a baby! They want me to grow it for them in my uterus! -My God! -Are you serious? You're thinking of having sex with your brother? Ew! And, oh, no! They want me to be the surrogate.<br> It's her egg and his sperm.<br> I'm the oven.<br> It's their bun.<br> What did you say? I had to think about it first, but what is there to think of? I'll be giving someone the greatest gift.<br> You'll carry their child and get them a Sony PlayStation? This is an incredible thing to do.<br> But there are things to think about.<br> Yeah, you'd be pregnant.<br> I mean, pregnant.<br> I know.<br> You'll put your body through an awful lot.<br> I mean, morning sickness, labor.<br> It's all for somebody else.<br> Yeah.<br> What's your point? Well, the stuff I just mentioned.<br> I couldn't do that.<br> I always figured the first time I had a baby, it'd be with someone I love.<br> And that baby was, you know a keeper.<br> You were more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.<br> If you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.<br> Just think it through.<br> Talk to somebody who's had a baby.<br> Like your mom.<br> My mom never gave birth.<br> Oh! But my birth mom did! I love this tushy! Can I take it to work with me? Yeah, sure.<br> It's not mine anyway.<br> It came with the pants.<br> I am so jealous.<br> You guys are just right there.<br> Yes.<br> Right where? The beginning, where it's all sex and talking and sex and talking.<br> You got to love the talking.<br> -And the sex? -We haven't had sex.<br> What's the big deal? This is special.<br> I want our love to grow before moving to the next level.<br> Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.<br> That is really nice Iying! -No way is that the reason.<br> -Why? Because you're not mature enough to understand that? He's right.<br> I'm totally lying.<br> Then what is it? Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.<br> And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes? I'm afraid I won't make love as well as him.<br> -I was going for the metaphor.<br> -I was saying the actual words.<br> He's had a lot of girlfriends.<br> Doesn't mean he's great in bed.<br> We share a wall.<br> Either he's great, or she liked to agree with him a lot.<br> Loudly and a lot.<br> All night long she'd agree.<br> It'll be different.<br> The sex will be great because you're in love.<br> -Just go for it.<br> -Yeah, you should.<br> All right.<br> I'll sleep with my girlfriend.<br> But I'm just doing it for you guys.<br> Now, the mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic Period.<br> Isn't the mastodon from the Pliocene Epoch? This is a museum.<br> No talking.<br> Right down here we have a large foot.<br> And over here we have Ross Geller.<br> Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.<br> Ross is one of our scientists.<br> Look at him hard at work.<br> Okay, moving right along.<br> Come on.<br> It's open.<br> Come in.<br> -I'm sorry I'm late.<br> -That's okay.<br> I had time to finish glazing my nipples.<br> You go all out when you're expecting company.<br> I was working on my pottery.<br> Oh! I didn't know that you did pot.<br> Mostly nudes.<br> It combines my two passions: pottery and erotica.<br> Erottery! Thanks for coming out to see me.<br> I thought it'd be a good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.<br> I don't think it's a good idea.<br> Why not? You'd be giving up a baby.<br> And I really don't I don't know if anything I said would make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.<br> No, no, I understand the pain.<br> Don't hurt the puppy! No, no.<br> The puppy is yours.<br> -I get a puppy? -But for only three days.<br> Why? I realize I don't have any right to start getting parent-y on you now.<br> Look at me and not the puppy.<br> It's very important.<br> I know what I'm talking about.<br> I gave up two babies.<br> I only wish I had someone who'd given up babies that told me how terrible it is.<br> I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.<br> That's okay.<br> No, we're listening.<br> It'd be something you'd regret every day for the rest of your life.<br> So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy it'd be a million times harder to give up a child.<br> Okay, fair enough.<br> Three days.<br> Oh, it's time to take my ass out of the kiln.<br> Could you sit there? I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.<br> You mean Dr.<br> Geller? Doctor? I didn't know he had a nickname.<br> Oh, he won't sit here.<br> Only people in white coats sit there.<br> Only people in blue blazers sit here.<br> -How come? -That's just the way it is.<br> That's crazy.<br> Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world: a world without lab coats and blazers.<br> But you not in a perfect world.<br> You in a museum now.<br> See that scientist? He and I used to play together in grade school, but now.<br> Peter! Hey, Peter! It's me! Rhonda, from P.<br>S.<br> 129? I shared my pudding with you, man! I gave you my Snack Pack! See? He pretend he don't even hear me! Everyone's pretending they don't hear you.<br> I don't know about your jackets and separate tables but Ross is my friend.<br> And if I save him a seat, he will sit in it.<br> Here! I saved you a seat! I'm cool here.<br> I'll catch up with you later.<br> This is saved.<br> Gift shop.<br> I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.<br> You do what you got to do.<br> The scientists and the tour guides never sit together.<br> Whatever.<br> It's like that everywhere.<br> Mon, back me up.<br> Where you work, the waiters eat with the waiters.<br> And the chefs eat with the other chefs? I eat by myself in the alley, because everybody hates me.<br> Okay, Rach, when was the last time you had lunch with the shipping clerks? I've never had lunch with the shipping clerks but it's totally different.<br> They're not allowed in the executive cafeteria.<br> Oh, I see what you're saying.<br> Look, Ross.<br> It's no big deal.<br> You wear a white coat.<br> I wear a blue blazer.<br> If that means we can't be friends at work, so be it.<br> I understand, you know? When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you.<br> So it's, you know, it's cool.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> When we're in the audience, he doesn't talk but he does wave.<br> Who's my puppy? Who's my puppy? Who's my puppy? -Have you named him yet? -No, I don't want to get attached.<br> -Can I hold him? -Sure.<br> Here.<br> -Come here, squirmy.<br> Hello -Not like that.<br> No.<br> Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden? I think it's time for puppy to go out again.<br> Come on, let's go to the balcony.<br> The street.<br> Come on, let's go to the street.<br> Don't go on the balcony until after I get back.<br> So did you do it? Yes, yes, we had the sex.<br> It was bad? It was fine, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as with Joey.<br> She was like, "l see your point.<br> I'm all right with it.<br>" There's not always a lot of agreement the first time.<br> Yeah.<br> Not for girls, anyway.<br> Guys agree like that.<br> Look, you have to help me.<br> I mean.<br> I know what to do with a woman.<br> It's always nice.<br> I need to know what makes it go from nice to: "My God! Somebody's killing her in there!" I'll show you something a lot of guys don't know.<br> All right.<br> Now.<br> You don't have to draw an actual Whoa, she's hot! Everyone knows the erogenous zones.<br> You got one, two, three four five, six and seven.<br> There are seven? Let me see that.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> That's one? Kind of an important one.<br> I was looking at it upside down.<br> Well, you know, sometimes that helps.<br> Most guys will hit one, two, three and then go to seven and set up camp.<br> That's bad? At Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.<br> You might if it were like seven.<br> All right, the important thing is to take your time.<br> You want to hit them all mix them up.<br> Keep them on their toes.<br> Oh, toes! For some people.<br> All right.<br> You could start out with a little one.<br> A two.<br> A one, two, three.<br> A three.<br> A five.<br> A four.<br> A three, two.<br> Two.<br> A two, four, six.<br> Two, four, six.<br> Four.<br> Two.<br> Two.<br> Four, seven! Five, seven! Six, seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! Seven! And there you are.<br> Yeah, that'll work.<br> Dr.<br> Geller? There's a seat here.<br> Thank you, Dr.<br> Phillips.<br> But I'm having my lunch at this table.<br> Here in the middle.<br> I'm having my lunch right here with my good friend, Joey.<br> If he'll sit with me.<br> I will sit with you, Dr.<br> Geller.<br> You know we work in a museum of natural history.<br> And yet, there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.<br> Now, I want you to know it took a tour guide to show this scientist the error of his ways.<br> You might even say he took me on a tour of myself.<br> Yeah, that was me.<br> I look around, and you know what I see? I see division.<br> Division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers.<br> I ask myself, "My God, why?" Now, I say we shed these coats that separate us.<br> And we get to know the people underneath.<br> I'm Ross! I'm divorced and I have a kid! I'm Joey! I'm an actor! I don't know squat about dinosaurs! I'm Ted, and I just moved here, and New York really scares me.<br> -There you go! -Hang in there, Teddy! I'm Andrew.<br> And I didn't pay for this pear.<br> Okay.<br> Good for you.<br> I'm Rhonda! And these aren't real! Wow, Rhonda.<br> -I'm Scott.<br> -Yeah, okay, Scott! I flip the light switch on and off or my family will die.<br> My mom's gonna be here any minute.<br> I can't.<br> I can't give him up.<br> Yes, no.<br> I can.<br> I don't want to.<br> But I can.<br> No.<br> I can't watch this.<br> It's like Sophie's Choice.<br> You know, I never saw that.<br> Oh, it was only okay.<br> I can't do this.<br> My mom was right.<br> If I can't give him up there's no way I can give up a baby.<br> Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed.<br> What else can I give them? A kidney! We were in the neighborhood.<br> We want to let you know that there's still no pressure.<br> If there was something you wanted to say, we'll be right there.<br> Who's this little guy? He's so cute! He reminds me of my old dog, Tumor.<br> You are so precious, I could take you home.<br> Why don't you? -Are you serious? -Yeah.<br> Thanks.<br> -What are you doing? -I'm okay with this.<br> You know why? Because look at them.<br> Look how happy they are.<br> And I made that, so you know.<br> It'll be a million times harder to give up a baby, but oh, my God! It'll feel a million times better, right? I'll do this.<br> I want to carry your baby.<br> Thank you so much! You don't know what this means to us.<br> I think I'm going to cry! It's going to be so great.<br> -What's going on? -I gave them the puppy.<br> It made them so happy, I decided to carry their baby.<br> -Phoebe -No, I know.<br> We're different, though.<br> This is a different situation.<br> I am not going to regret this.<br> I understand all that.<br> It's just, that was my puppy.<br> Would you ever be a surrogate? Depends who asked.<br> What if I asked? Oh, Mon, sure! -Really? -Yes.<br> You're not asking me, are you? -No.<br> -Yes.<br> Totally.<br> Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Yes, thank you!   <br>
