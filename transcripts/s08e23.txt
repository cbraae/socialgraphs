Ramoray.<br> It's Portuguese.<br> We need that information.<br> I'm a doctor.<br> - At this hospital? - Damn it! We're losing precious time.<br> You want this man's blood on your head Hands!

Wait a second.<br> Or maybe you could go in first.<br> He's not really my type.<br> Not you.<br> Dr.<br> Ramoray.<br> Ask him questions and see what he's like.<br> - People tell doctors everything.<br> - You said he's great.<br> Guys I meet seem nice at first, then turn out to be big jerks.<br> - You do attract some stinkers.<br> - I know.<br> Dr.<br> Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.<br> Three women have had their babies.<br> Give me good news.<br> How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine? - Three.<br> - Just 3? I'm dilated 3! We are moving along slowly.<br> Don't worry, you're doing great.<br> - I'll be back soon.<br> - Thank you.<br> I'm not waiting.<br> I'm gonna push this baby out.<br> I'm doing it.<br> Three centimeters.<br> That's gotta be like this, right? - Actually, it's more like this.<br> - Oh, stupid metric system.<br> Oh! Oh! Oh! We'll take you straight to the delivery room.<br> Oh, for the love of God! I'm Dr.<br> Drake Ramoray.<br> I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.<br> I've been dealing with Dr.<br> Wells.<br> I know.<br> I'm a neurologist.<br> To be safe Dr.<br> Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview.<br> So he sent me.<br> Dr.<br> Wells is a woman! That was a test.<br> Good response.<br> - All right.<br> Full name? - Clifford Burnett.<br> - Date of birth? - November 16, 1968.<br> Age? - Can't you figure that out? - I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.<br> - I'm 33.<br> - Okay.<br> - And are you married? - No.<br> Oh, really? So 33 and single? Would you say you have commitment issues? Are all the questions this personal? Yes.<br> Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.<br> - Oh, that's terrible.<br> I'm really sorry.<br> - Yeah.<br> Do you sleep with women and never call them again? - No.<br> - Excellent.<br> Excellent.<br> And finally, are you into any weird stuff, you know, sexually? - No! - Wrong answer.<br> - What else? What else? - He's 33.<br> - A widower.<br> - Oh! He seemed like a standup guy.<br> And he's not into anything weird sexually.<br> Enter Pheebs! - This room's available.<br> - Okay! Wait, listen to me! Since I've been waiting, four women one higher than the centimeters I'm dilated have come and gone with their babies.<br> I'm next.<br> My turn.<br> It's only fair.<br> If you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me, I will sue you.<br> Not this hospital.<br> I'm gonna sue you.<br> My husband is a lawyer.<br> - Rach? - You get back on that case, honey! I don't think the next patient is far along.<br> Okay.<br> Well, then bring her in.<br> Oh, my God! I can't believe this! And yet, somehow, it's true.<br> I mean, this is so great.<br> We're gonna be baby buddies! Squeeze your legs together, cover the baby's ears.<br> - Hi, sweetie! - Hi, sweetheart.<br> This is my husband, Sid.<br> I don't think you've met him.<br> I nabbed him at the dermatologist's.<br> Thank God for adult acne! I can't believe it.<br> I'm the luckiest guy in the world.<br> Really? What did he say? You have to speak loudly, he's almost completely deaf.<br> - Oh, there you go.<br> - Of course he is.<br> Congratulations! I didn't even know you got married.<br> - Oh, no.<br> We didn't.<br> - What? We're just having this baby together, but that's all.<br> You know? Why? We're just not in that place, you know? But we're very excited about this.<br> Oh.<br> Well, then shut me up.<br> Just tell me how.<br> Oh, I feel another one coming.<br> "Previously on" Friends: I've been at this for 17 hours.<br> - How many centimeters am I dilated? - Three.<br> Just three? I'm dilated three! - We talk about having babies someday.<br> - We're gonna try? - Right here? - No, not here.<br> Maybe here.<br> Your grandma's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.<br> - Mom, no.<br> - This isn't some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.<br> I take it you're just visiting someone? - Wanna visit someone else? - I would like that.<br> - That's him.<br> - Great.<br> Go get him! Maybe you could go in first.<br> I'm Dr.<br> Drake Ramoray.<br> I have a few routine questions.<br> Do you sleep with women and never call them again? Oh, my God! Should we tell Rachel there's an empty room right next to hers? We could.<br> Or we could have sex in it.<br> Well, let me think about that.<br> While I remove my pants! Okay, mister! Fertilize me! Does that sound like Janice? If it's not, then there's two of them.<br> And that would mean it's the end of the world! The One Where Rachel has a Baby - Part II Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> I can't believe this is taking so long.<br> How are you? Not bad.<br> You know that feeling, trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass? Weirdest thing.<br> Did I hear? Mother of God, it's true! Chandler Bing! Janice.<br> Not just Janice.<br> Janice in labor.<br> Contracting and everything.<br> Oh, this should be easy.<br> I have a very wide pelvis.<br> You remember, Chandler.<br> I didn't know you were pregnant.<br> Who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen? It's you.<br> This is yours.<br> What? Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years! That's funny.<br> Does it hurt? Does the labor hurt? Okay, I have one.<br> If you had to, which would you eat? A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla? I'd have to say the talking gorilla.<br> 'Cause at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.<br> - Oh.<br> Somebody went to college.<br> - Yeah.<br> Wow.<br> What is it? I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> My foot itches like crazy.<br> Oh.<br> I'll get it.<br> I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.<br> Relax.<br> It's not like we're forking.<br> Oh, that's five, Ross.<br> Five women have had five babies and I have had no babies.<br> Why doesn't she want to come out? I think you made such a nice home for her the last nine months, that she just doesn't want to leave.<br> Oh, look at you making up crap for me.<br> - Oh, God.<br> - Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Twenty-one hours.<br> You're a hero.<br> Do something! Get me drugs or you light a fire up in there and just smoke it out! I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.<br> What? Ten centimeters.<br> You're about to become a mom.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Okay.<br> Beat you, sucker! Oh, baby.<br> Oh, my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before.<br> Oh.<br> Okay, Mr.<br> Percocet.<br> I'm telling you, the guy from that show was here asking me all these weird questions.<br> Do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here? Rachel's having her baby! That's him! You know him? Okay.<br> Okay.<br> L Okay.<br> I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.<br> If it, you know, if it helps, you came off great.<br> A lot better than I'm coming off right now.<br> I don't believe this.<br> You had him pretend he was a fake doctor? Fake? Excuse me? Hello? - You tried making me think I was crazy? - That was wrong.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> It's just that I liked you so much.<br> Can we just start over? I don't think so.<br> If I may? You told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? Now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.<br> She was married to a gay ice dancer.<br> She gave birth to her brother's triplets.<br> Her twin sister used to do porn.<br> - We're trying to dial down the crazy.<br> - Right.<br> We don't know each other, so it'd be easy to forget this but there's something between us.<br> I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.<br> - It doesn't happen to me, either.<br> - Me, neither! Push.<br> Push.<br> We're gonna push for five more seconds.<br> Five, four Three, two, one! Oh! The next contraction will be in 20 seconds.<br> - I can't push anymore! - You're doing great.<br> Oh, God! Twenty seconds, my ass!

The baby's buttocks.<br> She's breech.<br> - I thought she had two heads.<br> - Oh, God! Will she be okay? - She'll be fine.<br> - Yeah.<br> She's in a difficult position, so push hard.<br> - Okay.<br> - Go.<br> Come on.<br> Go! Go! You'll have to push harder.<br> - I'm sorry, I can't! I can't! - Yes, you can.<br> I know you can do this.<br> I can't do it.<br> Please, you do it for me! Let's go.<br> One more time.<br> One final push.<br> Ready? One, two, three.<br> Good.<br> Keep pushing! Are you okay? You have no idea how much this hurts.<br> Keep going! Keep going! Here we go! She's upside down, but she's coming! - Oh, God! - Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, she's here.<br> Oh, she's perfect.<br> Oh, wow!

Oh, I could squeeze your little head.<br> I won't.<br> - Honey, what's the matter? - Nothing.<br> I just can't stop crying.<br> The doctor said it's normal, plus you're sleep-deprived.<br> You guys are all sleep-deprived.<br> I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.<br> Oh, God.<br> - What's the matter now? - I was reliving it.<br> Do you know what you're gonna call her yet? Wait, it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original.<br> Actually, we've narrowed it down to two.<br> And you know what? I love them both.<br> So just pick one, and that'll be it.<br> Wow, okay.<br> Everyone? This is Isabella.<br> - Hi, Isabella! - Hi.<br> What? That's not her name.<br> I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.<br> - What was the other one? - Delilah.<br> Oh, great! At least she sounds like a biblical whore.<br> So, I guess we're back to Baby Girl.<br> What will we do? - You'll find a name.<br> - Easy for you to say.<br> You know what your kids' names will be.<br> - You do? - I had them picked out since I was 14.<br> Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it? - Well, tell us, what are they? - Okay.<br> If it's a boy, it's Daniel.<br> - And if it's a girl? - I don't want to say.<br> Oh, stop.<br> Tell us.<br> We're not gonna want it.<br> Okay.<br> It's Emma.<br> Emma.<br> See, I don't want it.<br> - Take it.<br> - What? She's clearly an Emma.<br> Oh, honey, but you love that name.<br> Yeah.<br> But I love you more.<br> Besides, nothing goes with Bing.<br> So I'm screwed.<br> Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.<br> Oh.<br> Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he? He's a keeper.<br> - How are you feeling? - Oh, I'm fine.<br> I really admire what you're doing.<br> Just raising her all alone.<br> I'm not doing it alone.<br> I have Ross.<br> Sure.<br> Now.<br> But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married? Well, then he gets a divorce.<br> It's Ross.<br> I'm telling you.<br> Listen to Janice.<br> They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.<br> - That's never gonna happen with Ross.<br> - That's what I thought.<br> I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend a weekend with her father and little Miss New Boobs.<br> Really? I hate to be the one to say it but, honey, you two are on your own.<br> Well, that's, you know, that's We've been alone for the last Maybe we won't be alone.<br> Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross.<br> And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss.<br> You know? So it might be the beginning of something.<br> - Hey, Janice.<br> - Oh, hi.<br> Who's this little guy? - Aaron, your future son-in-law.<br> - Oh, no, no.<br> - I'm gonna leave you three alone.<br> - Okay.<br> Man, you see the kid on that nose? You know what I was thinking about? That kiss before we left the apartment.<br> That was something, huh? Yeah.<br> Yeah, it really was.<br> But we, we gotta be careful.<br> We You know, we can't let that happen again, you know? Right.<br> - We don't want to go down that road.<br> - No.<br> That's why I brought it up.<br> - They didn't have any sodas? - Oh, my God.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I was talking to this nurse.<br> Completely forgot.<br> And so it begins.<br> She in there? Yeah.<br> She's putting her down now.<br> That's her.<br> - Look at Emma.<br> - I can't decide who she looks like.<br> Oh, what, are you kidding? She's gorgeous! It's all Rachel.<br> I'm sorry.<br> For the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know.<br> Because you're not in that place.<br> Which would be fine, except you totally are.<br> It's complicated, okay? You love her, you always have, you have a child together.<br> There's no right answer.<br> Look, we've been together.<br> Then apart.<br> Then together, then apart.<br> And now we have a baby.<br> It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out? I could never do that to Emma.<br> I mean, she came into this world thinking everything Now me.<br> What, do they put something in the water here? It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well now.<br> I know.<br> If you try to make it more, you might wreck it.<br> - Yeah, exactly.<br> - Right.<br> Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.<br> Hey.<br> I saw a woman breastfeeding twins at the same time.<br> It is like a freak show up here.<br> - What's the matter? - Nothing.<br> What is it? Hey? - Really, it's nothing.<br> I'm - Rach, come on.<br> What? I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.<br> What are you talking about? What about Ross? Please.<br> He'll be with his real family.<br> The twins and little Miss New Boobs.<br> Okay, how long was I watching that woman? I'm just saying that, you know someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and he's gonna have his own life.<br> Right? Yeah, I guess so.<br> I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.<br> That's pretty dumb, huh? Hey, you listen to me.<br> Listen to me.<br> You are never, ever gonna be alone.<br> Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.<br> Joey.<br> Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you? You don't have to worry about that, okay? Could you grab me my other box of tissues? - They're under Ross' coat.<br> - Sure.<br> Oh, my God! Joey? Oh, my God.<br> Okay.<br> - That was amazing.<br> - I know.<br> Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have started our family.<br> In nine months we could be here having our own baby.<br> And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.<br>   <br>
