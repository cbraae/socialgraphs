                    			- Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> I saw the Porsche parked out front.<br> Can I get the keys? I'll take that bad boy for a spin.<br> Ross drives it? When I ask, you say you're the only one allowed to.<br> He's my brother, plus he drives so slow he couldn't hurt it.<br> It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.<br> Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> Saw the Porsche.<br> Looking good.<br> When can I take it out again? - You let Joey drive it? - I've never driven it.<br> Not once.<br> Okay, once.<br> Okay, I drive it all the time.<br> So much for the "you-can-drive-it but-don't-tell-Rachel" plan.<br> Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.<br> I can fix this.<br> Monica, Rachel thinks all you talk about is the wedding.<br> I won't let you drive the Porsche because you're a terrible driver.<br> There.<br> That wasn't about the wedding.<br> If you want a ride in the Porsche, I'll take you around the block.<br> You got a couple hours? The One With Chandler's Dad Whew, that was a brisk ride.<br> - Take the top down, did you? - Only way to fly.<br> Give me the keys.<br> Monica's wrong.<br> I'm an excellent driver.<br> You're fast and irresponsible.<br> That adds up to a bad driver.<br> In high school, that added up to head cheerleader.<br> Did you see how she looked at me? She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.<br> - She's checking out your beehive.<br> - What? - Give me a brush.<br> - The keys.<br> - No way! - Well, no brush.<br> Fine.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> If I remember correctly, there's a comb on the floor of the bathroom.<br> Alimony.<br> We still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.<br> Oh, right.<br> Maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.<br> He's your father.<br> He should be at our wedding.<br> I don't even know him.<br> I haven't seen him in years.<br> And when he finds out he wasn't asked? We don't run in the same circles.<br> I hang out with you guys and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.<br> I think I want to trade circles.<br> You don't want him there.<br> Nobody will stare at the bride when the groom's father's wearing a backless dress.<br> As long as he's not wearing a white dress and veil, I don't care.<br> I think I need to do some shopping.<br> Nice.<br> My God! - What do you think you're doing? - Just washing the windshield.<br> There's no way I'll let you drive this car.<br> Just hand over the keys.<br> Oh! Do not start this car.<br> Okay, okay.<br> I will give you 20 bucks if you get out of this car right now.<br> Hey! Look.<br> If you're so freaked out, get in the car.<br> With you? Yeah, right.<br> All right.<br> Okay, okay, okay.<br> - What are you doing? Get in front.<br> - In the death seat?! - Hey, guys.<br> - Hi, sweetie.<br> - Ready to go? - My purse is at Mon's.<br> I'll be back.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> - What? Oh.<br> That one kept going.<br> So, you and Phoebe, huh? - How long have you been going out? - A month.<br> We ought to get to know each other better.<br> - Sure.<br> I'd like that.<br> - Yeah.<br> So, uh .<br> What's your name? - It's Jake.<br> - Joey.<br> - Do you like the Knicks? - Yeah, big fan.<br> Me too.<br> There's a game Tuesday.<br> Do you want to go? Great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.<br> Here.<br> - What's this? - Your suitcase.<br> We're going to Vegas.<br> Are you serious? Eloping? No more stupid wedding stuff.<br> No more these flowers, these flowers.<br> Think of the money we'll save.<br> We're not eloping.<br> Can our wedding be bigger, please? We're going to see your dad.<br> I want to get to know my father-in-law.<br> When we went over this, I won.<br> No, you didn't.<br> Honey, just so you know .<br> Now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.<br> Forget it.<br> I don't want to go.<br> I don't want to see him.<br> I know your dad embarrassed you.<br> All kids are embarrassed by their parents.<br> You need a new word for what I went through.<br> In high school, he came to all my swim meets dressed as a Hollywood starlet.<br> Hard enough to be 14, skinny, wearing Speedos Mom promised I'd grow into.<br> You look up in the stands.<br> There's your dad cheering you on.<br> Dressed as Carmen Miranda, wearing a headdress with real fruit that he'll later give to your friends as a healthy snack.<br> He was at every one of your swim meets cheering you on.<br> That's a pretty great dad.<br> He had sex with Mr.<br> Garibaldi.<br> - Who's Mr.<br> Garibaldi? - Does it matter?! You're not 14 anymore, okay? Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.<br> If he's not at your wedding, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.<br> Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.<br> - I never get to win anymore? - How much did you ever win before? You know how when you're wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear? Well, when Jake did it I saw that he was wearing women's underwear.<br> I know.<br> They were mine.<br> Oh! No, no, wait.<br> That's weird.<br> We were goofing around, and I dared him to try them on.<br> That's weird! - I'm wearing his briefs right now.<br> - That's kind of hot.<br> I think so too.<br> And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.<br> I wouldn't know about that.<br> Jake says that women's underwear is actually more comfortable.<br> He loves how silk feels against his skin.<br> Next he'll say your high heels are good for his posture.<br> There's nothing wrong with Jake.<br> He is all man.<br> I think more than you.<br> He looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacies.<br> Only a man completely secure in his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear.<br> I don't think you could.<br> - I am secure with my masculinity.<br> - Okay, whatever.<br> You've seen my huge stack of porn.<br> God, I forgot how much I love driving.<br> I have got to get my license renewed.<br> You don't have a valid driver's license? Pull over right now.<br> You're so tense.<br> You just gotta relax, okay? Okay? Just need to relax.<br> All right? Just need to relax.<br> What are you? That's not funny.<br> Stop horsing around.<br> I am not horsing around, okay? I am "Porsche-ing" around.<br> Uh-oh.<br> Stay calm.<br> Nothing will happen.<br> You're not in that much trouble.<br> Really? You think so? I'm talking to myself.<br> You're going down! Has someone taken your order? Oh, yeah.<br> She did.<br> He did.<br> She? I'm sorry, I'm new.<br> I don't .<br> - I just ordered a beer.<br> - You're straight.<br> I get it.<br> If we called your dad, we'd have better seats.<br> I don't want him to know we're here yet.<br> I'm not ready.<br> He won't be too happy to see me either.<br> Why not? He's kind of tried to contact me a lot the last few years.<br> - What? Yeah.<br> He's made phone calls, written letters.<br> He came to New York.<br> I said I was too busy.<br> It's very "Cats in the Cradle.<br> " I don't want to get into it.<br> Here we go.<br> Ladies and gentlemen,  welcome the incomparable   Helena Handbasket.<br>  Hello, darlings.<br> And there's Daddy.<br> Switch places with me.<br> Come on! I'll go under, you go over.<br> - Yeah, I'll get right on that.<br> - Come on! What? No.<br> Hey, Rach, come on.<br> I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.<br> Hi, officer.<br> Was I going a little too fast? Oh, my God.<br> - Can I see your license, please? - Absolutely.<br> It's weird.<br> I had a dream last night that I was stopped by a policeman.<br> And then he .<br> Well, I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.<br> - Your license.<br> - Yes.<br> Here you go, Officer Handsome.<br> - It's Hanson.<br> - Oops, sorry.<br> My mistake.<br> Dear Lord! - Wow! - Here it comes.<br> This is a great picture.<br> Really? You think so? You know, I had just rolled right out of bed.<br> You look phenomenal.<br> She should! It was taken 10 years ago! You know, you probably wonder about the old date.<br> Yes.<br> You're an Aquarius, huh? - I'll bet you're a Gemini.<br> - No.<br> - Taurus? - No.<br> - Virgo? - No.<br> - Sagittarius? - Yep.<br> I knew it.<br> I knew it! You won't speed anymore, right? I won't speed.<br> - Promise to take care of this? - I promise.<br> Let him drive.<br> Does he have a license? - Can he handle a stick? - Well .<br> I can handle a stick! - That can't be your father.<br> - I've been saying that for years.<br> - Oh, my God! - What? That's Mr.<br> Garibaldi playing the piano.<br> Hello, and welcome to the show.<br> I see some of our regulars in the audience.<br> And a couple of irregulars.<br> - He's coming into the audience.<br> - Relax.<br> You'll be fine.<br> Oh, much better.<br> You're invisible now.<br> - Where are you from? - Bakersfield.<br> - I'm sorry? - Bakersfield.<br> No, no, I heard.<br> I'm just sorry.<br> I'll meet you back at the hotel.<br> Look, a standing ovation already.<br> So early in the show.<br> Turn around, darling.<br> Let me see your pretty face.<br> Can we have our drinks, please? Waiter? tress? - Hey, Pheebs.<br> - Hey.<br> Check it out.<br> How much of a man am I? Wow, nice.<br> Manly, and also kind of a slut.<br> I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.<br> The silk feels really good.<br> And things aren't as smashed down as I thought they would be.<br> That's great.<br> You have so many more choices than with men's underwear.<br> Bikini, French cut, thong.<br> And the fabrics: cotton, silk, lace.<br> You know what I've always wondered about? Pantyhose! The way they start at your toe, then they go all the way up to - I should go take these off.<br> - I think it's important you do.<br> What's your name? Chandler.<br> Chandler? What an unusual name.<br> You must have had terribly fascinating parents.<br> Oh, they're a hoot.<br> And who is your friend? I'm Monica.<br> - Monica.<br> Where are you from? - New York.<br> I'm not very fond of New York.<br> Queens, I like.<br> What is this sparkling something, honey, huh? Actually, Monica and I are engaged.<br> Really? Congratulations.<br> When's the big day? In two weeks.<br> I see.<br> Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.<br> So, you're bald.<br> Wait, wait.<br> We'd love it if you could be there.<br> Really? I know it would make me happy ma'am.<br> Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.<br> I'm getting all misty here.<br> You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.<br> - You okay? - Yeah.<br> Thanks for making me do this.<br> Before we go on with the show, I want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other.<br> In every life a little rain must fall.<br> Fortunately in my life .<br> When I was growing up, I played the one on the far left.<br> Remind me to introduce you to someone.<br> - Who? - Fourth gear.<br> What does he want? I wasn't doing anything.<br> Maybe he saw your hands slip briefly from the 10 and 2:00 position.<br> Maybe it's Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more.<br> It's a different guy.<br> - Good evening, sir.<br> - Do you know how fast you were going? No, I don't, but it couldn't have been more than 60.<br> You're right.<br> It was 37.<br> You're not ticketing me for driving too slow, are you? That's right.<br> You know, officer .<br> I had the weirdest dream last night.<br> Oh, my God! Your license, please.<br> You don't want to hear about my dream Officer Pretty? It's Petty.<br> I'll be right back with your ticket.<br> - You have a son.<br> - I know.<br> I know.<br> - Feel better? - Yeah.<br> Much.<br> Listen .<br> Not that I'm insecure about my manhood or anything, but I need to hook up with a woman right now.<br> I understand.<br> You look familiar.<br> Do I know you? I don't think so.<br> Maybe it's because I'm on television.<br> - I'm an actor on Days of our Lives.<br>  - Wow.<br> Really? - $4.<br>50, please.<br> - Oh, let me get this.<br> These are for you.<br>   <br>
