What? What?! Well, they should put that on the box! - They do.<br> - No, they don't! Well, they should put it in huge block letters! - Let's just forget about the condoms.<br> - Well, I may as well have! - I was really freaked out too when - Freaked out? I'm not freaked out.<br> I'm indignant as a consumer! - You know what? Let's talk later.<br> - No, I wanna talk now.<br> In fact, I wanna talk to the president of the condom company.<br> Okay, maybe I should come back Yeah, I'll press one! - I looked everywhere.<br> No gas leak.<br> - So now I can heat this up? I'll get moving on that door.<br> Great.<br> Could you not tell Chandler and Monica about this? They don't have any kids of their own and this door was like a child to them.<br> I have to put in a new lock.<br> They'll find out anyway.<br> This looks like an all-day job.<br> I'll have to cancel my yoga class.<br> Could you tell Jasmine I can't make it to yoga? - Sure.<br> - Namaste.<br> - What happened to the door? - So it's noticeable? - Is Rachel here? - Didn't you two already talk? Yeah, but You guys know Rachel and I slept together, but there's something else.<br> Rachel's pregnant.<br> - Holy mother of God! - I can't believe it! - With my child.<br> - That is brand-new information! - You already know, don't you? - A little bit.<br> - How you doing? - Okay.<br> I mean, I'll be okay.<br> I didn't handle it well.<br> - What'd you say? - Nothing.<br> But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.<br> Then when I turned around, she was gone.<br> But in my defense, I found out that condoms are only 97%"%" effective.<br> - What? - I gotta go find her.<br> Hold on! Are you serious? So, like, They should put that on the box! - Evidently, they do.<br> - What?! - I can't believe we're here.<br> - You've gotta be kidding.<br> What?

I kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here.<br> I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier.<br> - Can you stay up near my head? - Yeah, sorry.<br> I went crazy.<br> I was thinking about me, and I should've thought of you - Head, Ross! Head! - Right.<br> I want you to know that I'll be there through this whole thing.<br> Doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes, baby-proofing the apartment.<br> - We can do that after we get married.<br> - Married? We should get married.<br> Because that's your answer to everything? No, it's the right thing to do.<br> Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.<br> But we are not in love, are we? No, but still, I mean, you can't possibly do this alone.<br> Excuse me? Come on, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.<br> - What? - How can you have a baby by yourself? - I can too eat by myself! - When have you ever? When certain people leave the table and I am not finished! Certain others take two hours to eat soup! Please, you inhale your food.<br> I grew up with Monica.<br> If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat! Am I interrupting? No, Dr.<br> Long, come in.<br> This is Ross, the father.<br> But not the husband, because she can do this alone.<br> Nice to meet you.<br> I'll get started on this.<br> - Why can't you admit you need me? - I need you to stay near my head! Okay.<br> Everything looks good.<br> Here it is on the screen.<br> There's your uterus and right here is your baby.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Wow!
