Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex? Yeah.<br> So you must be going somewhere fancy to celebrate.<br> A Knicks game.<br> Aren't you a little overdressed? I've never had a one-year anniversary before so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public restroom.<br> You guys do that?

Her name is Emma.<br> Why did you change it? Ella was so much prettier.<br> What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart.<br> Hey, your English is getting better.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - I know.<br> She may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.<br> - What you working on? - Monica and Chandler's recommendation.<br> I want it to sound smart, but I don't know any big words or anything.<br> - Why don't you use your thesaurus? - What did I just say? Watch.<br> Here, highlight the word you want to change, go under "tools" and the thesaurus generates Gives.<br> Gives a whole list of choices.<br> You can pick the word that sounds smartest.<br> My God, that's great.<br> I'm smart.<br> No, no, I'm: "Brainy, bright, clever.<br>" I love this thing! Look out, ladies! Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package! God so beautiful.<br> I know, isn't she? No, I was talking about your bedding.<br> All right, what's your news, Amy? Well I'm getting married.<br> Wow! Oh, my God! - To who? - This guy.<br> He has a killer apartment.<br> - And? - And it's on Fifth.<br> And the elevator opens up right into the living room.<br> - No, what's he like? - Oh, he's okay.<br> Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark? - Yeah.<br> - It's his dad.<br> - Wow, so he's gotta be - Old? Yeah.<br> But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.<br> Sweetie, I gotta tell you, it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like Myron.<br> Yeah, I told you he was old.<br> Sit down.<br> Sit down.<br> Honey, you know I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love.<br> - Do you remember Barry? - Remember him? God, we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.<br> Sometimes just nodding is okay.<br> But anyway, listen.<br> Not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made.<br> Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.<br> Your soul mate is out there somewhere.<br> Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about.<br> You're right.<br> - You're right.<br> I'm gonna do it.<br> - Okay.<br> I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr.<br> Right.<br> Okay, let's keep talking.<br> Excuse me.<br> Anniversary.<br> Excuse me.<br> Anniversary.<br> Sir, could you move your nachos?

I never thought I could love someone this much! I feel the same way! You're so generous and kind, and you're amazing in bed! It's our anniversary.<br> Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard.<br> Someone has a special question to ask.<br> How lame.<br> It's so tacky and impersonal.<br> - Really? - It's the worst way to propose.<br> Excuse me.<br> I finished my recommendation.<br> Here.<br> And I think you'll be very, very happy.<br> It's the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.<br> I don't understand.<br> Some of the words a little too sophisticated for you? It doesn't make any sense.<br> Well, of course it does.<br> It's smart.<br> I used a thesaurus.<br> On every word? Yep.<br> All right, what was this sentence originally? "They are warm, nice people with big hearts.<br>" And that became, "They are humid, prepossessing Homo sapiens with full-sized aortic pumps.<br>" Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> And hey, I really mean it, dude.<br> All right, Joey, I don't think we can use this.<br> - Why not? - Well, because you signed it: "Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani.<br>" Why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself.<br> You don't need a thesaurus.<br> Just write from here.<br> Your full-sized aortic pump.<br> - Amy.<br> Hi.<br> - I took your advice.<br> - I left Myron.<br> - Good for you! I know.<br> I'm Erin Brockovich.<br> Yes, you are.<br> - I'm so proud of you.<br> - Thank you.<br> So can I stay with you? But Erin Brockovich had her own house.<br> Look who's back.<br> Why do you have bags? Why does she have bags? I'm staying with you guys.<br> - What? - We're gonna be roomies! Come on.<br> - You slept out here? - Yeah.<br> Amy kept kicking me in her sleep, yelling, "Myron, get off!" But we're getting rid of her, right? Please tell me we're getting rid of her? - Joey, I can't do that.<br> - Oh, come on.<br> Last night I was finishing off a pizza, and she said: "A moment on the lips, forever on the hips.<br>" I don't need that kind of talk in my house! Joey, look, I know that she's difficult but I think it's really good that she's here.<br> Because we'll appreciate it more when she's gone? No, it's just Look, when I first moved to this city, I was a lot like her.<br> I was spoiled, self-centered.<br> And you guys really took care of me.<br> Yeah.<br> Monica made us.<br> Well, whatever.<br> I really appreciate it because I don't think I would be the person I am today if it wasn't for you guys.<br> So I want to help Amy the way you guys helped me.<br> And I know it's gonna take patience, but that's okay.<br> - Good morning.<br> - Yeah.<br> That's what I'm wearing today.<br> That's why I hung it on the door.<br> Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.<br> You know what? I was thinking that maybe now would be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.<br> Oh, I can't, honey.<br> I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.<br> I am not happy.<br> Sure you want to eat that? I'm curvy and I like it! - Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> I just had the worst anniversary ever.<br> I doubt that.<br> Tell her about us last year.<br> Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch, and he wrote me a rap song.<br> - Seriously? - Word.<br> Mine was worse than that.<br> - Well, what happened? - We were at the game.<br> This guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing.<br> - That is so tacky.<br> - Well, that's what I said.<br> But it turns out Mike was planning to propose to me that same way last night.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Mike was gonna propose? - That's huge.<br> - Do you want to marry him? Yeah, I really do.<br> Yes.<br> But after I dumped on the way he was gonna do it I don't think he'll ever ask again.<br> I said no in Barbados, and now this? She's right.<br> If I were a guy and Did I just say, "If I were a guy"? You don't need him to propose to you.<br> Maybe you could propose to him.<br> Oh, I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> Isn't that a little desperate? I proposed to Chandler.<br> All right, moving on.<br> I don't think it was desperate.<br> It was amazing.<br> Thank you.<br> - Well, do you think I should propose? - I think it could be kind of great.<br> Absolutely.<br> You'll love the feeling.<br> There's nothing like it.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> So how should I do it? How about at a game on the big screen? How about at a Foot Locker? What? What, he obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to.<br> - Plus, he'd never suspect it.<br> - Yeah, that does make sense.<br> - Okay, now, would you two like that? - Sounds good to me.<br> But what would a guy think? - Nana's on the phone.<br> - Wow.<br> That's interesting, since she died seven years ago.<br> She did? Who got her condo in Boca? Hello? It's our nanny.<br> Hi.<br> Oh, God, I hope you feel better.<br> Okay.<br> Bye.<br> That's Molly.<br> She's sick.<br> - Can you watch Emma today? - I can't.<br> I have back-to-back classes.<br> Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting.<br> Menstrual cramps.<br> I don't think that's what this is.<br> - Can any of you watch Emma? - No, I'm sorry, sweetie.<br> No, I've got work, and then I'm proposing.<br> Great.<br> Shoot.<br> What am I gonna do? Well, I could do it.<br> - Well, actually - Can I talk to you for a second? I do not want her babysitting our child.<br> - Why not? - For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.<br> - Ella's a nice name.<br> - Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.<br> - The next one? - Okay.<br> I don't want her watching our baby.<br> Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person.<br> This is a huge breakthrough for her.<br> She just offered to do something for another human being.<br> You know, I don't know.<br> Ross, I'm telling you she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this, all right? Do you understand how important that is in our world? Listen, I couldn't help but overhear, because I was trying to.<br> Listen, let me do this.<br> I really want to help you guys out.<br> And plus, Rachel's been so wonderful to me.<br> - Absolutely.<br> - Oh, great! So how much does it pay? How's the second draft of the letter coming? Great.<br> I'm finished.<br> In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.<br> - You dropped it off? - Yeah.<br> Can we read it? Can you print out another copy? No can do, amigo.<br> No, I didn't use the computer.<br> It felt more personal to handwrite it.<br> - You handwrote it? - Yeah, and don't worry.<br> I didn't try to sound smart at all.<br> See you later.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> That letter is gonna go in our file.<br> We're never gonna get a kid.<br> We're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds.<br> It's okay.<br> You know what? I will just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.<br> Okay, good.<br> Hello, this is Chandler Bing.<br> Someone just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter and Okay.<br> Thank you.<br> Goodbye.<br> We're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.<br> - They loved it.<br> - What? They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the letter.<br> They thought Joey was a child? She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey, what'd you guys do today? Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.<br> - That sounds like fun.<br> - Yeah, not really.<br> Babies are dull.<br> - Hey.<br> Hi, how's my girl? - I'm fine.<br> And I got you a present for letting me stay with you.<br> - Ready? - Yeah.<br> You pierced her ears? Doesn't it make her nose look smaller? You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me? If I had told you, then it wouldn't have been a surprise, now would it? I think she looks cute.<br> But I am wrong.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Here comes Ross.<br> He's gonna flip out.<br> Why, did something happen to his falafel cart? - Hey, guys.<br> - Ross! Hi, Emma.<br> Why is she wearing her hat so low? - She can barely see.<br> - I don't really want her to see.<br> Why not? Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.<br> Like war.<br> Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator.<br> Remember? It was in a milk carton, but it looked like meat? Come here.<br> Come here.<br> There she is.<br> Hi.<br> - What? - Nothing.<br> Hi.<br> What? - Please tell me those are clip-ons! - Oh, they're real.<br> Did she do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her! I know, I know.<br> And you were right, Ross.<br> Okay? You are so irresponsible! I am never letting you babysit again! You know what? This kid needs me, okay? - She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.<br> - I'm a cool, fun aunt.<br> Okay.<br> Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects.<br> All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life.<br> This is how you repay me? I don't need you to help me.<br> I already know what I'm gonna do with my life.<br> - Oh, yeah? Since when? - Since today.<br> I am going to be a baby stylist.<br> - What? - That's not a thing! Well, it should be.<br> I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming.<br> - Babies don't care if they're slim! - Enter Amy.<br> - Amy, l I just I just wanna - What? What are you gonna do? No more falafel for you! Great game, huh? - Why do you keep looking at the screen? - I'm not.<br> I'm praying.<br> Please let the Knicks win.<br> Thank you, Thor.<br> - Where are you going? - I'm going to the bathroom.<br> - Well, I think you should wait.<br> - Why? Well, if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.<br> Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard.<br> Someone has a special question to ask.<br> Mike Hannigan, will you marry me? Get a load of this.<br> She's proposing to him! Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.<br> Well, that's not very enlightened.<br> Boo us? Boo you! Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.<br> Oh, hi.<br> Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.<br> No, my mommy and daddy aren't home right now.<br> Okay, bye-bye.<br> She was nice.<br> Joey, get Amy's bags.<br> She is moving out.<br> - You're kicking me out? - You put holes in my baby's ears.<br> At least now people will know she's a girl! I can't believe I ever even tried to help you.<br> - You are so beyond help! - You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.<br> - Excuse me? - You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment.<br> Then I tried to help your daughter de-emphasize her flaws and suddenly I'm the bad guy? - Joey, where are those bags? - She has a lot of crap! You know? When I moved in here, I thought, "This will be so great.<br> Just us sisters back together again like when we were kids.<br>" Except without that stupid Jill.<br> Who has gotten fat, by the way.<br> Seriously? Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.<br> - Hips or thighs? - Ass and face.<br> Oh, my God! I thought she was on Atkins.<br> She was.<br> Carbs found her.<br> See? This is what I wanted.<br> Two sisters talking about real stuff.<br> Oh, I can give you that.<br> - You can? - Yeah.<br> I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're You're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.<br> Thank you.<br> You gotta admit, Emma does look cute.<br> - Did you just say, "Emma"? - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Ella.<br> That woman didn't know what she was talking about, Mike.<br> Obviously, you have balls.<br> - Please, let's forget the whole thing.<br> - I would love it.<br> - Consider it forgotten.<br> - Thank you.<br> But just so you know However and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes.<br> Whether, you know, it's at a basketball game or in skywriting or, you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.<br> It's in the cake, isn't it? Where else would lame Mr.<br> No Balls hide it? What's the matter with me? Why do I keep ruining this? - I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - No, it's my fault.<br> I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and I just wanna tell you I love you, and I wanna spend my life with you - I'm gonna do this now.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - Phoebe, l - Wait.<br> Oh, wait.<br> Ready? Okay.<br> Phoebe, I love you.<br> There's no one else in the world I would ask to marry me three times.<br> But I want to take care of you have babies with you and grow old with you.<br> Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me? Yes.<br> - I love you.<br> - I love you more.<br> Not possible.<br> She's gonna be Mrs.<br> No Balls! So how's the baby-styling business going? Not that great.<br> It's almost as if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.<br> That's shocking.<br> There's Ross.<br> Hey, Ross.<br> Hello, Ross? He's rude.<br>   <br>
