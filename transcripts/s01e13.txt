                    			-I'm sorry! -That is it! You barge in here and you don't knock? You have no respect for privacy.<br> No, you wait! -Can I just say one thing? -What?! That's a relatively open weave.<br> I can still see your nippular areas.<br> The One With The Boobies Honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are other things.<br> When the phone rings and she takes a shower.<br> That's pretty much it.<br> -But you tell it really well, sweetie.<br> -Thanks.<br> Okay.<br> Now go away so we can talk about you.<br> Okay.<br> I'll miss you.<br> -lsn't he great? -He's cute.<br> He likes you so much.<br> I know.<br> He's so sweet.<br> And so complicated, you know? And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky.<br> Think you'll do it on his couch? I don't know.<br> That's a little weird.<br> It's vinyl.<br> Okay, you guys want anything else? -Could I have? -We're all out.<br> Anybody else? Did I miss something? No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.<br> What were you doing seeing her boobies? It was an accident.<br> I wasn't across the street with a telescope.<br> Can we change the subject, please? These aren't her "boobies.<br>" These are her breasts.<br> Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.<br> I always liked "Bazoombas.<br>" Gives them a Latin spin.<br> Can we drop this already, please? Why are you embarrassed? They were very nice boobies.<br> "Nice"? They were "nice"? That's it? I mean, mittens are "nice.<br>" Okay.<br> Rock, hard place.<br> Me.<br> You're so funny! He's really funny.<br> I wouldn't wanna be there when the laughter stops.<br> Whoa, back up there, sparky.<br> What did you mean by that? It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues that you use your humor to keep people at a distance.<br> I mean, I just met you.<br> I don't know you from Adam.<br> Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.<br> -How did you know that? -It's textbook.<br> Hey, you guys.<br> You all know my dad, right? -How long are you in the city? -Two days.<br> I got a job.<br> I'm better off staying with Joey than going back and forth on the ferry.<br> -I don't know this one.<br> -This is my friend Roger.<br> -Good to meet you.<br> -You too.<br> -What happened to the puppet guy? -Dad.<br> Oh, excuse me.<br> So, Ross, how's the wife? Chandler, say something funny.<br> I gotta go.<br> Miss you too.<br> -I love you, but it's getting late -Say hi.<br> Hey, Ma.<br> I made the appointment with Dr.<br> Bassida and Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma? Her name's Ronni.<br> She's a pet mortician.<br> Sure.<br> So, how long you been? Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the navy yard? -Since then? -No, it's only been six years.<br> I wanted you to think of a nice memory so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.<br> -What are you doing? -Chopping garlic.<br> You don't crush it? You're having an affair, I chop garlic.<br> It's a wacky world.<br> Joe, you ever been in love? -I don't know.<br> -Then you haven't.<br> -You're burning tomatoes.<br> -You're one to talk.<br> Your dad's in love.<br> The worst part is, it's with two different women.<br> Oh, man! Please tell me one of them is Ma.<br> Of course one of them's Ma.<br> What's the matter with you? It's like if you woke up and found out your dad leads this double life.<br> He's like actually some spy working for the ClA.<br> That'd be cool.<br> This blows! Do you think Dad cheated? I don't think so.<br> That would involve sex.<br> I'd like to think that our parents don't do that.<br> I know.<br> Why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have? Why can't you stop staring at my breasts? What? What? Didn't you get a good enough look? We're all adults here.<br> There's only one way to resolve this.<br> Since you saw her boobies you have to show her your pee-pee.<br> You know, I don't see that happening.<br> Come on.<br> He's right.<br> Tit for tat.<br> Well, I'm not showing you my tat! -It's Phoebe.<br> -And Rog! Come on up.<br> Oh, good! Rog is here.<br> -What's the matter with Rog? -It's a little thing.<br> I hate that guy! So he was a little analytical.<br> That's what he does.<br> Come on, he's not that bad.<br> You're wrong! Why would I marry her if I thought that she was a lesbian? I don't know.<br> Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.<br> Why? Why would l? Why? I don't know.<br> Maybe low self-esteem? Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling.<br> Maybe Wait! Go back to that "sibling" thing.<br> Well, I don't know.<br> You could've sabotaged your marriage so the sibling would feel like less of a failure.<br> That's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures.<br> -You think I'm a failure? -lsn't he good? Yeah.<br> No, that's not what I was saying.<br> I thought you were on my side.<br> But maybe you sucked up to them so they'd favor you.<br> I married a lesbian to make you look good! You're right.<br> I mean, you're right.<br> It wasn't just the Weebles, but the Weeble Play Palace and the Weeble's Cruise Ship with this lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.<br> And Mom just gave them all away.<br> That's tough, tough stuff.<br> Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.<br> -Feel better.<br> -We're gonna be late, sweetie.<br> -Thanks for everything, Mon.<br> -No problem.<br> Listen, it was great seeing you again.<br> Mon, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.<br> I hate that guy! Good night, you guys.<br> Oh, look.<br> It's the woman we ordered.<br> Hey, can we help you? No, thanks.<br> I'm just waiting for Joey Tribbiani.<br> I'm Joey Tribbiani.<br> Oh, no, not you.<br> Big Joey.<br> Oh, my God! You're so much cuter than your pictures.<br> I'm Ronni.<br> Cheese Nip? Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a nip.<br> Most people, when their pets pass on want them like they're sleeping.<br> Occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.<br> Like chasing their tail.<br> Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.<br> Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.<br> -That's a good one! -Hey.<br> Hey, Dad.<br> Ronni's here.<br> -Hi.<br> -Hey.<br> Hello, babe! What are you doing here? Oh, you left your hair at my place.<br> I thought you'd need it tomorrow.<br> Thank you.<br> So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk? Look, I shouldn't have come.<br> I better go.<br> I'll miss the train.<br> -I don't want you taking that thing.<br> -Where do I stay? Here? We'll go to a hotel.<br> We'll go to a hotel.<br> -No, you won't.<br> -No, we won't.<br> If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.<br> I want you here so I can keep an eye on you.<br> -You're gonna keep an eye on us? -Right.<br> As long as you are under my roof you're gonna live by my rules.<br> That means no sleeping with your girlfriend.<br> Wow, he's strict.<br> Dad, you'll be in my room.<br> You can stay in Chandler's room.<br> And Chandler will be? Out here with me, bunking up.<br> Oh, bunking up.<br> If you smell s'mores, don't be alarmed.<br> Thanks.<br> You're a good kid.<br> I'll show you to my room.<br> That sounds weird not followed by, "No, it's late.<br>" This is just for tonight.<br> Tomorrow you gotta change.<br> Change? -Break up with Ronni -I can't! Then come clean with Ma! This is not right! I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room! Hey, kickie! -What are you doing? -Getting comfortable.<br> -I can't sleep in my underwear.<br> -Well, you're gonna.<br> I was thinking about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.<br> Are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes? You know, how I date all these women.<br> I always figured, when the right one comes along  I'll be able to go the distance.<br> Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking You're not him, you're you.<br> When they wanted you in your father's business, did you cave? -No.<br> -No.<br> You chose the out-of-work-actor business.<br> That wasn't easy, but you did it.<br> I believe when the right woman comes along you'll have the guts to say, "No, thanks, I'm married.<br>" -You really think so? -Yeah, I really do.<br> -Thanks, Chandler.<br> -Get off! -Hi.<br> -Hi.<br> May I help you? Joey said I could use your shower since Chandler's in ours.<br> Okay.<br> Who are you? Oh, I'm Ronni.<br> Ronni Rapalono.<br> The mistress? -Come on in.<br> -Thanks.<br> I'm Rachel.<br> Bathroom's there.<br> Ronni, how long has Chandler been in the shower? Oh, like five minutes.<br> Perfect.<br> Fasten your seat belts, it's pee-pee time.<br> -Hey, Mr.<br> Trib.<br> -Hey, good morning, dear.<br> Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing.<br> -What's with you? -I thought it was Chandler! You were supposed to be in there so I'd see your thing! Sorry, my thing was in there with me.<br> -How's it going? -Good.<br> Roger's having a dinner thing.<br> He wanted me to invite you guys.<br> -So, what's going on? -Nothing.<br> It's just.<br> It's Roger, you know? There's something about We just feel that he's.<br> -We hate that guy! -We hate him! -We're sorry, Pheebs.<br> -Okay.<br> Don't you think it's just that he's so perceptive it freaked you out? No, we hate him! I'm sorry.<br> -Ma! What are you doing here? -I came to give you this and this! Big ring! Why'd you fill your father's head with garbage about making things right? Things were fine this way! There's chicken in there.<br> Put it away.<br> For God's sake, Joey! Really.<br> -Hold on.<br> You knew? -Of course I knew.<br> What do you think? Your father is no James Bond.<br> You should've heard his stories.<br> "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's.<br>" -What is that? Please! -So then, how could you? Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling.<br> Nothing made him happy.<br> Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.<br> Now he's happy.<br> I mean, it's nice.<br> He has a hobby.<br> Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful  but what the hell are you talking about? -I mean, what about you? -Me? I'm fine.<br> Look, honey, in an ideal world there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting.<br> And something else: Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along  he's so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.<br> He's been more loving.<br> It's like every day is our anniversary.<br> -I'm happy for you? -Well, don't be! Now everything's screwed up.<br> I just want it the way it was.<br> Ma, I'm sorry.<br> I just did what I thought you'd want.<br> I know you did, cookie.<br> I know you did.<br> So tell me.<br> Did you see her? Yeah.<br> -You're 10 times prettier than she is.<br> -That's sweet.<br> Could I take her? With this ring, no contest.<br> Oh, no! Don't ever do that! -What? -I'm sorry.<br> I have a thing, which means you can't ever do that! -What's wrong, sweetie? -Nothing.<br> -No, what's wrong? Come on.<br> -Okay.<br> It's nothing.<br> I'm fine.<br> It's just It's my friends.<br> They have a liking problem with you in that they don't.<br> They don't? But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.<br> They don't see all the good and sweet stuff.<br> -They think you're a little -What? Intense and creepy.<br> -Oh.<br> -But I don't.<br> Me, Phoebe.<br> -I'm not at all surprised about that.<br> -That's why you're so great.<br> It's quite typical behavior when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.<br> You know, this kind of codependent, emotionally stunted sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups which might as well have nipples on them.<br> And you're all like, "Oh, define me! Define me! Love me! I need love! You talked to your dad? He's gonna keep cheating on Ma like she wanted.<br> Ma will keep pretending she doesn't know.<br> And my sister, Tina, can't see her husband.<br> He got a restraining order.<br> Which has nothing to do with it.<br> I found out today.<br> Things have changed here on Waltons'mountain.<br> -So, Joey, are you okay? -Yeah, I guess.<br> It's just You know, they're parents.<br> After a certain point, you gotta let go.<br> You gotta let them make their own mistakes.<br> And think, in a few years, we'll turn into them.<br> Oh, please.<br> If I turn into my parents, I'll be an alcoholic blond chasing men or I'll end up like my mom! -Hey.<br> -Hey, Pheebs.<br> How's it going? Okay, except I broke up with Roger.<br> -Yeah, right.<br> -No, no, really.<br> -What happened? -I don't know.<br> I mean  he's a good person, and he can be really sweet.<br> In some ways, I think he is so right for me.<br> It's just.<br> I hate that guy! Hi, Joey.<br> What's going on? Clear the tracks for the boobie payback.<br> Next stop, Rachel Greene.<br> Joey, what the hell were you doing? Sorry, wrong boobies! Hello, Joey! Hello, dear!   <br>
