I know.<br> It sounds crazy, and I'm not impulsive, but we have so much in common.<br> - Oh, really? We're both teachers.<br> - And we were both in the Peace Corps.<br> - Peace Corps, really? When we were building in Uruguay, we were two towns apart and never met.<br> Yeah.<br> It wasn't a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left.<br> - Shall we get me really drunk? - Sure.<br> Howdy, doodie.<br> That's funny, yeah.<br> You're the funniest man here in a bunny costume his wife made him wear.<br> Relax, man.<br> You're looking a little "flushed.<br>" - Our question might get answered.<br> - What question? Who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross? - There's no question.<br> - So you think Ross too? - You picked Ross? - Ross is strong.<br> He's the strongest out of all three of you.<br> Except for Joey.<br> - I can't believe you didn't pick me.<br> - She's right.<br> I am stronger.<br> I would destroy you.<br> Really? You think you're stronger? Why don't you prove it? I'll prove it like a theorem! All right! Stop it! Stop!

There you go.<br> My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.<br> We were, but now we've got candy.<br> I'd rather have the money.<br> That's not your choice.<br> Happy Halloween! This isn't fair.<br> Is it fair that you put on a cape and get stuff? Shut up! You shut up! - You can't tell me to shut up.<br> - I think I just did.<br> And here it comes again.<br> Shut up! No, I got it.<br> I'm good.<br> I got it.<br> Wait, I had one more thing to say.<br> Right.<br> Shut up.<br> You're a mean old woman.<br> Wait! Shut Don't cry! Let me get my checkbook! You don't have to do this.<br> The strength inside you means the most.<br> You're loyal, you're honest and you have integrity.<br> That's the strength I want in a man.<br> That means nothing to me.<br> Come on! - Hi, liar.<br> - Hey.<br> He's marrying you because he thinks the things you were saying were true.<br> - They could be true.<br> - But they're not.<br> It's a fine line.<br> - Why are you lying? - I don't know.<br> He did this stuff, I said I did it too.<br> He got so excited, it was fun.<br> It's a disgusting habit, and I want you to quit now! She's helped so many people quit.<br> We'd better get going.<br> - You have a church group meeting.<br> - Right.<br> - It was nice meeting you.<br> - You too.<br> And, Ursula, it was really nice meeting you tonight! Come on! Bunny versus Doodie.<br> We're waiting! Okay, guys.<br> One match, winner take all.<br> Wait.<br> What does the winner get? - Pride.<br> - And dignity.<br> Okay, if you say so.<br> All right, ready, set, go! - Come on! - Come on! - Wow, they're both really strong.<br> - Or equally weak.<br> Oh, God.<br> Chandler's making his sex face.<br> - So you getting tired? - No.<br> I could do this all day.<br> Yeah.<br> Me too.<br> - Getting a little tired, though.<br> - God, I'm exhausted.<br> This is starting to look bad for me, okay? Mona's standing right there.<br> She's talking to Joey! You've got to let me win! Let me win.<br> My wife thinks I'm a wimp.<br> At least you have a wife.<br> I get divorces and knock people up.<br> And I'm dressed as doodie.<br> - You're Spud-nik.<br> - Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.<br> Please? She's watching.<br> - Fine.<br> - Thanks.<br> - Oh, no.<br> - Oh, yeah! My hero! You're a weird lady.<br> Ursula said she left her purse.<br> What a relief.<br> It has the numbers for her prayer chain.<br> I'm sure it does.<br> Guess I'll see you at the wedding.<br> I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding.<br> - I wish you all the luck in the world.<br> - We'll be okay.<br> It's so perfect, and she's been saving herself for me.<br> - I can't let you do this.<br> She's lying.<br> - What? She is lying.<br> And I bet I could prove it.<br> Excuse me.<br> Okay.<br> Yeah, not a prayer chain.<br> But what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.<br> Here's the name tag from where she works as a waitress.<br> Not a teacher, a waitress.<br> Here, she always lies about this.<br> - How old did she say she was? - She told me she was 25.<br> I almost don't want to show you.<br> Just remember, I'm a minute younger.<br> I am so stupid.<br> Of course she's not a teacher.<br> There's no such thing as a "Top Secret School for the Children of Spies.<br>" No, you're not stupid.<br> I'm not smart.<br> I just wanted so much to be impulsive for once.<br> - To be romantic.<br> - Good.<br> You should be impulsive and romantic.<br> You did it with the wrong person.<br> - What? - It's weird, two people look so alike.<br> And so different.<br> Eric! Let's go! - Better go deal with it.<br> - Yeah, you should.<br> Hurry up! I gotta pray! I had to give the kid That's not bad.<br> I also had to go to a few houses as his girlfriend.<br> I am awful with children.<br> You're good with kids.<br> They're just crazy on Halloween.<br> They're all greedy, hopped up on sugar.<br> - That's all it is? - Absolutely.<br> Halloween is the worst.<br> Except for Christmas.<br> And their birthdays.<br> They get crazy during the summer too.<br> And any time they're hungry or sleepy.<br> Kids are tough.<br> Good luck with that.<br> Look, I'm sorry you lost.<br> I got a secret for you.<br> I let him win.<br> Was that a secret, or a lie? - No, I let him Ross? - Yeah? Would you tell her I let you win, please? Chandler "let me win.<br>" No, Chandler's really strong.<br> My arm is so sore.<br> Oh, nurse? I am strong.<br> I'll show you.<br> Chandler, please.<br> What's the matter? Scared? Let's go, big bunny! One, two, three.<br> Go! I'm gonna kill myself!   <br>
