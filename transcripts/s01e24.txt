This sure trumps the "Has he pooped?" series.<br> Ross, we love him, okay? But right now he's just a little fat guy.<br> How excited can we get? -What you got? -400 pictures of Ben on a rug.<br> -Oh, my God! -Let me see! The One Where Rachel Finds Out Here's little Ben nodding off.<br> Look at Aunt Monica's little boy! -Look, he's got Ross haircut.<br> -Let me see.<br> Oh, God! Is he just the sweetest thing? You must just wanna kiss him all over.<br> That would be nice.<br> -Pardon? -Nothing.<br> Just a little extra air in my mouth.<br> Chan, can you help me out? I'll pay you back.<br> Right.<br> Including the waffles last week, you now owe me  1 7 jillion dollars.<br> -Really, I'll pay you back this time.<br> -Where's this money coming from? I'm helping out at the NYU Med School with research.<br> What kind of research? Just, you know, science.<br> Science.<br> Yeah, I think I've heard of that.<br> It's a fertility study.<br> Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.<br> Actually, a little more than that.<br> Thank you, God.<br> This will bring us so much joy.<br> Come on, it's not that big a deal.<br> I just go down there every other day and make my contribution to the project.<br> But at the end of two weeks, I get $700! You're gonna be making money hand over fist.<br> That's funny.<br> Very funny.<br> This is great.<br> I actually know somebody who loves what they do.<br> But what do you do to unwind after a tough day at work? Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.<br> The ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys.<br> I just love barbecuing with you.<br> Men are here! We make fire.<br> Cook meat.<br> Put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.<br> Cute.<br> -Melanie called.<br> She'll be late.<br> -Okay.<br> How are things going? Is she becoming your "special someone"? I don't know.<br> She's pretty great.<br> What does she think of your little science project? You think I'd tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup? Man's got a point.<br> The tough thing is, she really wants to have sex.<br> Crazy bitch.<br> I got a week left to go.<br> According to the rules  I can't conduct personal experiments, if you know what I mean.<br> Joey, we always know what you mean.<br> How long did you think this barbecue would last? -I'm going to China.<br> -Jeez, you say one thing, and.<br> -China? -For the museum.<br> Someone found a bone.<br> They don't want us to have it.<br> I'm going to try to persuade them.<br> It's a whole big bone thing.<br> Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.<br> If you want to reach me, you can't.<br> So here's my itinerary.<br> -Here's a picture of me.<br> -Oh, let me see.<br> Could you show it to Ben every now and then so he doesn't forget me? "Hi, Ben.<br> I'm your father.<br>" "I am The Head!" This barbecue's gonna be very fun.<br> I wanted to wish Rachel a happy birthday before I left.<br> -She's out having drinks with Carl.<br> -Hey, who's Carl? That guy she met at the coffeehouse.<br> -There's this guy she met at -The coffeehouse? Right.<br> So you do know who he is.<br> I'll go say goodbye to the guys.<br> Hey, you know what? Tell them that bone story.<br> -I have to go to China.<br> -The country? No, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront.<br> Do you know who Carl is? Let's see.<br> Alvin, Simon, Theodore.<br> No.<br> Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.<br> How can she, when she's never shown interest in you? -Forget about her.<br> -He's right.<br> Please move on.<br> Go to China.<br> Eat Chinese food.<br> Of course, there they just call it "food.<br>" Yeah, I guess.<br> I don't know.<br> All right, just give her this for me, okay? We're looking out for you.<br> We want you to be happy.<br> I may only have a couple beers in me, but I love you.<br> I'm still on my first.<br> I just think you're nice.<br> That's when we started this fruit basket business.<br> We call ourselves "The Three Basketeers.<br>" Like "The Three Musketeers," only with fruit.<br> -How do you want your burgers? -Presents first! We're doing presents first.<br> Hey, hold on there, tiger.<br> How are you holding up? Well, not so good.<br> She thinks tonight we're gonna complete the transaction, if you know what And you do.<br> Have you ever thought about being there for her? What do you mean? You know, just be there for her.<br> Not following you.<br> Think about it.<br> Okay.<br> I'm guessing this is from.<br> -Thank you, Melanie.<br> -This one right here is from me.<br> Okay.<br> It's light.<br> It rattles.<br> It's Travel Scrabble! Thank you.<br> This one's from Joey.<br> It feels like a book, I think it's a book.<br> And it's a book! It's Dr.<br> Seuss! That book got me through some tough times.<br> There's a little child inside this man.<br> The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.<br> -Who's this from? -From Ross.<br> Oh, my God! He remembered! -Remembered what? -lt was months ago.<br> We walked by this antique store.<br> I saw this pin.<br> I told him it was like one my grandma had when I was little.<br> I can't believe he remembered! Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? It's so pretty! This must've cost him a fortune.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Remember when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that expensive crystal duck? What did you just say? Crystal duck.<br> No, no, no.<br> The "love" part? -Oh, my God! -Oh, no, no, no.<br> That's good.<br> Just keep rubbing your head.<br> That'll turn back time.<br> This is unbelievable.<br> I mean, this is unbelievable! I know.<br> This is really, really huge.<br> No, it's not.<br> It's small.<br> It's tiny.<br> It's petite.<br> It's wee.<br> I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.<br> Is there a mute button on this woman? I think this is so great.<br> I mean, you and Ross! -Did you have any idea? -No, none! My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out  but nothing ever happened.<br> What else did he say? Does he wanna go out? Given that he's in love with you  he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee.<br> Ross? All this time? I've gotta talk to him.<br> -He's in China! -The country.<br> Is his flight gone? Yes! He's watching a woman do this: He's gone! His flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes.<br> -What about time difference? -From here to the airport? -You'll never make it! -I've gotta try.<br> What'll you say to him? -I don't know.<br> -Then you shouldn't go.<br> Right.<br> If you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.<br> But if it's good, tell him now.<br> -Maybe I'll know when I see him.<br> -All right, does this help? No.<br> Look, all I know is, I cannot wait a week.<br> This is just too big.<br> I've just gotta talk to him.<br> Okay, I'll see you later.<br> Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! All right.<br> -Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.<br> -Your boarding pass? I need to talk to my friend.<br> Sorry, you're not allowed here without a pass.<br> He's right there, in the blue jacket! Can l? I'm sorry.<br> Federal regulations! Then could you please just give him a message for me? -This is very important.<br> -All right.<br> What's the message? I don't know.<br> Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir? I have a message for you.<br> Rachel loved the present.<br> She'll see you when you get back.<br> What? Toby, I don't know what she's talking about.<br> There's no Rachel.<br> Don't give me that deep freeze.<br> Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey! I think I blacked out there for a minute.<br> It was nothing.<br> Well, now we gotta find something fun for you.<br> You know what? Forget about me.<br> Let's give you another turn.<br> -Me, again? -Sure.<br> Why not? Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow! I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you'd be.<br> How do you mean? I had you pegged as a guy who's always, "Me, me, me!" But you, you're a giver.<br> You're the most generous man I ever met.<br> I mean, you're practically a woman.<br> -You're just saying that.<br> -No.<br> A woman! -So? -I missed him.<br> -I'm so sorry.<br> -That's too bad.<br> Yeah, right.<br> No, I feel bad for her.<br> I do.<br> I can think of somebody other than myself.<br> All right, I'm going to bed.<br> -Happy birthday.<br> Hang in there.<br> -Thanks.<br> Yes! Pizza coupons.<br> Okay.<br> You guys want help cleaning up this mess? That'd be great.<br> So, Rach, you wanna save this wrapping paper? Are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I throw it out? I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> Thought about it all the way there and I thought about it all the way back.<br> You know, it's Ross! You know what I mean? It's Ross.<br> -Sure! -Sure.<br> I don't know.<br> This is just my initial gut feeling  but I'm thinking it'd be really great.<br> Oh, my God, me too! We'd be like friends-in-law! The best part is you already know all about him.<br> You start on the 1 5th date.<br> But it would be like starting on the 1 5th date.<br> Another good point.<br> I mean, on the 1 5th date, you're already in a very  "relationship-y" place.<br> You're committed.<br> What happens if it doesn't work out? -Why isn't it working out? -Sometimes it doesn't.<br> Is he not cute enough? Does he not make enough money? -No, I'm just -Maybe there's someone else.<br> -ls there someone else? -No, there is no one else.<br> Then why are you dumping my brother? Hey, big Spender! She's still asleep.<br> -So how'd it go? -You know how you think you're great? The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.<br> Last night I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.<br> So I had to do all this other stuff.<br> And the response I got! Man, oh, man! It was like a ticker-tape parade! I know.<br> My room's very, very close to the parade route.<br> It was amazing, and not just for her.<br> For me too! It's like, all of a sudden I'm blind  but all my other senses are heightened.<br> It's like I was able to appreciate it on another level.<br> -I didn't know you had another level.<br> -I know.<br> Neither did l! Is something going on with O.<br>J.<br>? Hey, great skirt.<br> Birthday present? -From who? -You.<br> I exchanged the blouse you got me.<br> Well, it's the thought.<br> Doesn't Ross'flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27B? Yeah.<br> Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it.<br> I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.<br> Why? I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him.<br> I'd be going out with all of you.<br> There'd be pressure No pressure, no pressure! Nothing has happened, and you're already so I'm not "so.<br>" Okay, I was a teensy bit weird at first  but I'll be good.<br> I promise.<br> -Who is it? -It's me, Carl.<br> -Come on up.<br> -Behind my brother's back? Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.<br> -Seven hundred bucks! -All right, you did it! Do we have any fruit? Man, hell of a two weeks.<br> You know what? I feel I learned something.<br> You'll stick with this "all for her" thing? What are you, crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? If I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I'm not against environmental issues, per se it's just that guy! I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.<br> Excuse me, I'm trying to have a date here.<br> Fine.<br> Just stop thinking about me.<br> Can't do it, can you? I'm thinking about you.<br> So what? I don't get it.<br> What do you see in this guy? Happens to be a very nice guy.<br> I mean, come on, buddy! Get a real car! Rachel, come on.<br> Give us a chance.<br> Ross, it's too hard.<br> Why, because it'll get weird for everyone else? This is about us.<br> I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.<br> You're like my best friend.<br> If we broke up, and I lost you What makes you think that? Have you been involved where you haven't broken up? No.<br> But it only has to happen once.<br> You and I both know we are perfect for each other.<br> Right? So the only question is: Are you attracted to me? I don't know.<br> I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.<br> Well, start looking.<br> -Wow.<br> -Exactly! And I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! Right! You're right.<br> You know what? I'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.<br> I am so sorry! If you wanna finish your drinks, please do.<br> -I'm sorry, I gotta go.<br> I'm sorry.<br> -But.<br> -Where are you going? -To get Ross.<br> -My God, this is so exciting! -I know.<br> If you want the rest of my date, I'm not gonna finish it.<br> -Rachel, he's not a sandwich.<br> -No, he's a banker with opera tickets.<br> Hello! -Where you going? -Airport.<br> You can't tell him.<br> There's so much I haven't done.<br> I haven't watched Baywatch with Yasmine Bleeth! Chandler, relax.<br> This is a good going to the airport.<br> Oh, well then fly, good woman, fly like the wind.<br> -I'm flying! -Tell him I'm the one who blew it! Yes, another successful case for the love doctor.<br> Excuse me! Pardon me.<br> Excuse me.<br> Sorry.<br> Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! Hey! I got that.<br> -Thanks, sweetie.<br> -No problem.<br> I can't wait for you to meet my friends.<br> You don't think they'll judge me? -No, they will.<br> I just.<br> -Can't wait! Come on, they're gonna love you.<br>   <br>
