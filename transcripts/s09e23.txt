                    			Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go.<br> That's right.<br> Daddy and Uncle Joey are going on a trip today.<br> We're going to a conference in Barbados.<br> Right? Can you say, "Barbados"? Barbados.<br> Okay.<br> I've gotta say, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me give my speech.<br> And I have a surprise.<br> I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference.<br> That's right! These babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.<br> Do you have anything that will get us out of them? We're excited to hear the speech, but the rest of the time we're gonna want to do island stuff.<br> David will probably want to hear a few lectures.<br> - Right, because he's a scientist.<br> - No, no.<br> He's been in Minsk for eight years.<br> If he gets too much direct sunlight he'll die.<br> - Okay, we'd better go.<br> - Yeah? - So we'll see you guys tomorrow.<br> - All right, let's do it.<br> A five-hour flight with Charlie, have a couple drinks get under that blanket and do what comes natural.<br> It's a blanket, Joe, not a cloak of invisibility.<br> The One In Barbados mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 - Wow, this place is beautiful! - Look at all these paleontologists! I know.<br> There are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.<br> - My God, I can't believe you're here! - I think I've been recognized.<br> - This happens all the time.<br> - Dr.<br> Geller? I am such a huge fan.<br> That never happens.<br> I've been following your career for years.<br> I can't wait for your keynote speech.<br> - Wow! This is very flattering.<br> - I would love your autograph.<br> Well, sure.<br> - "Dear?" - Sarah.<br> "Sarah.<br> I dig you.<br>" - "Dr.<br> Ross Geller.<br>" - Oh, thank you so much.<br> Sure.<br> Sarah, I'd like you to introduce you to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.<br> - And this is Joey Tribbiani.<br> - Are you a paleontologist? No, God, no, no.<br> I'm an actor.<br> You probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives.<br>" Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives.<br>" There's no "the.<br>" Okay, Ross.<br> Boy, you Yeah.<br> No, no.<br> I play Dr.<br> Drake Ramoray.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I don't own a TV.<br> - You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at? David, can you help me? I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.<br> Certainly.<br> That's a combination of Bernoulli's Principle and Newton's third law of motion.<br> - See? Yeah.<br> That's the same as, "It has something to do with wind.<br>" I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.<br> I should go too.<br> Now, tomorrow do you want to share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I meet you? Mike? Who's Mike? - Mike's your ex-boyfriend.<br> - That's right! Oh, yeah.<br> Wow, I had totally forgotten about him.<br> - That's a blast from the past, huh? - No, it's okay.<br> Honest mistake.<br> It really doesn't mean anything.<br> I mean, you know Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time.<br> - She does? - Let's get you out of here.<br> Well, at least you took me down with you.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I just I keep thinking about Mike.<br> I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together.<br> Why? Why do I miss Mike? That's just That's gonna go away, right? - Well, I guess.<br> In time.<br> - Yeah.<br> I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.<br> You just did it again.<br> Chandler.<br> Your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone.<br> Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, huh? I wouldn't read too much into it.<br> Still, a girl calls you by her ex-boyfriend's name that's not a good thing, right? - Let me stop you there.<br> Because I think I see where this is going.<br> I'm not very good at giving advice.<br> See, if you want advice, go to Ross or Monica.<br> Or Joey for advice about pizza toppings or a burning sensation when you pee.<br> I'm sorry, I just wish there was something I could do, you know? - Well, you know Phoebe - Seriously, we're gonna do this? I'm sorry, I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already.<br> - Why did Phoebe and Mike break up? - Because his penis was too big.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's the kind of thing I do.<br> They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married.<br> What if you let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage? That's great.<br> That's great.<br> I'll propose to her.<br> What? I was probably going to do it at some point.<br> - No, I didn't mean now.<br> - Well, why not? It's brilliant.<br> "Goodbye, Mike.<br> We'll see you at the wedding, fella.<br> Well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding, but" - Well, thank you, Chandler.<br> Sincerely.<br> - Well, you're welcome.<br> Glad I could help.<br> - How do you think I should propose? - I'm pretending to read here.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Yeah.<br> How you doing? Hey, how are you? You said you were gonna wear a thong.<br> Where's the thong? I didn't mean a thong.<br> I meant thongs.<br> You really should have been more clear about that.<br> You're never gonna guess who I just saw downstairs.<br> Britney Spears! Yeah.<br> She never misses these conferences.<br> - No, I just saw Dr.<br> Kenneth Schwartz! - Oh, my God! - I know! - Did you talk to him? Oh, yeah.<br> What am I gonna say to Kenneth Schwartz? You could say, "Hey, Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?" - You ready to go? - You're gonna go now? - I thought we could hang out.<br> - I can't.<br> I have seminars all day.<br> I promised Ross I'd look at his speech.<br> But maybe we could have dinner later? Out on the balcony? Lt'll be romantic.<br> Will you wear a thong? I will if you will.<br> You got yourself a very weird deal.<br> I'm good.<br> I have dinner plans.<br> - So you gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah.<br> I got tons of stuff I could do.<br> I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.<br> Joe, have you looked outside? No.<br> Why? - Oh, man.<br> - There's an indoor pool.<br> - You could swim there.<br> - Yeah.<br> I wasn't gonna swim.<br> I was gonna dig a hole.<br> That Mike thing was interesting.<br> I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.<br> - I do.<br> Want a hint, huh? I do.<br> I do.<br> Okay, I'm sensing this is some kind of wordplay because you are pink with barely controlled glee.<br> - David's gonna propose to Phoebe.<br> - What? Why? Because we were talking about ways he could beat Mike and I told him Phoebe wanted to get married.<br> Chandler, we have talked about this.<br> You are not supposed to give people advice! Couldn't you have made some inappropriate joke? I did! A penis one! Just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said? They've only been going out for a few weeks.<br> Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.<br> I mean, she'll say no David's heart will be broken, it'll be too hard for them to recover and then Phoebe will end up alone again.<br> Man, that's some bad advice.<br> Oh, hey.<br> Thank God.<br> You guys are here.<br> - What's going on? - Everything is upside-down here.<br> It rains all day long and nobody watches TV, and Ross is famous.<br> I don't want to alarm anybody but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed.<br> Okay.<br> When I go places with high humidity it gets a little extra body, okay? That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross.<br> I'll show you guys where to check in.<br> Oh, honey? Can you make sure we get a king-size bed? Oh, David, get one for us too.<br> Oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one.<br> And with mirrors on the ceiling.<br> And make sure our room isn't next to theirs.<br> Oh, you guys are so lucky you're here with people.<br> You know, it's just such a romantic place.<br> I just wish I could share it with a guy.<br> - Not Joey.<br> - Not Joey.<br> No.<br> - I was just lusting after Chandler.<br> - Yeah, right.<br> So I'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.<br> Tonight? Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is.<br> Yes, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think.<br> That's one-seventieth of a carat.<br> And the clarity is quite poor.<br> Nice.<br> - Monica, can I talk to you for a second? - Okay.<br> David's gonna propose to Phoebe tonight.<br> See what happens when you give people advice? - Well, I hope you told him not to.<br> - That would be advice! Okay, fine.<br> I'll handle this.<br> - Phoebe? - Yeah? - I need to talk to you.<br> - Are you leaving the Supremes? Okay, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice.<br> David's gonna propose to you tonight.<br> Wow, really? That's fantastic! What? Are you serious? You want to marry him? - What about Mike? - Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike? Let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle, okay? I can just see it.<br> "Mike, do you take Phoebe?" You know? It's every girl's dream.<br> Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer? Sure.<br> Look, okay, bottom line? I love Mike David! David! I love David.<br> Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Roseannadanna.<br> "By using CT scans and computer imaging, we can, in a very real way bring the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century.<br>" It's great.<br> You'll be the hit of the conference.<br> It'll be even better tomorrow because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet.<br> - Hey, guys.<br> - The chocolates aren't here.<br> Damn it! Ross just read me his speech.<br> It's fantastic.<br> Oh, is it on the computer? Because I'd love to give it a read.<br> If you want to check your e-mail, just ask.<br> What? May I? What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for dino week nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.<br> - The wet season is June to December.<br> - It's not the time, Charlie.<br> Oh, no.<br> No, no! Dear God, no! What, did someone outbid you for the teapot? Secret teapot.<br> Your computer.<br> I don't know what Everything's gone.<br> - What do you mean? - Must be a virus.<br> I think it erased your hard drive.<br> What? Oh, my God.<br> What did you do? Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.<br> - Why? Why would you open it? - Well, it didn't say, "This is a virus.<br>" - What did it say? - "Nude" "Pictures of Anna Kournikova.<br>" - I'm so sorry.<br> - What am I gonna do? - My speech is gone! - It's not gone.<br> I'm sure you printed out a copy.<br> You have a hard copy? No, I don't! Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now.<br> - It's really gone? - Yep.<br> I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career.<br> - I just feel awful.<br> - Yeah, you should.<br> Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? She's never even won a major tournament.<br> Well, I tried Billie Jean King, but You know, you and Monica have the same I'm-gonna-kill-you look.<br> I can usually make it go away by kissing her.<br> Get out.<br> You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.<br> - What do you do? - I usually go play Tetris on somebody else's computer.<br> I can't believe this is happening.<br> I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow.<br> I have to stand up in front of all these people.<br> What am I gonna say? You can use a speech I memorized for auditions.<br> I don't think your monologue from "Star Wars" is gonna help me right now.<br> Ross, we can solve this.<br> I just heard your speech.<br> - We can re-create it.<br> We've got all night.<br> - What, you really think we can do that? Oh, wait.<br> Joey and I are supposed to have dinner.<br> Don't worry about that.<br> I mean, Ross needs you.<br> Rachel and I will stay and help any way we can.<br> All right.<br> Okay, let's do it.<br> Well, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating.<br> And then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic Era, the breakup of Pangaea.<br> Hello? And then there's the overview of the Triassic.<br> Any chance any of this happened in a galaxy far, far away? - Hello? "- Okay", "Mike?" Enough is enough.<br> You love Phoebe, and she loves you.<br> So get over your l-never-wanna-get-married thing and step up! Who is this? "This is Monica", "Phoebe's friend.<br>" Phoebe is back with David.<br> He's gonna propose, and she's gonna say yes but I know she really wants to be with you.<br> He's gonna propose? I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair! If Phoebe wants to marry David, she should.<br> I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.<br> Neither should you.<br> You don't tell me what to do.<br> I tell you what to do.<br> Just call her.<br> She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados.<br> And while I've got you, you've got curly hair.<br> What do you do in the humidity? Damn it! - Well, I hope you're happy.<br> - I hope you're happy too, honey.<br> Phoebe's going to say yes to David.<br> - That's what happens when you meddle.<br> - Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.<br> No, it's not.<br> She's still in love with Mike.<br> - There's no chance that will work? - No, I called.<br> - It's not gonna happen.<br> - Meddler! Meddler! If you hadn't meddled to start with then I wouldn't have had to go in and meddle myself.<br> No matter how much we meddle, we'll never be able to unmeddle the thing that you meddled up in the first place! This vacation sucks! I'm so bored.<br> Stupid rain.<br> We can't do anything.<br> Well, I brought some books.<br> We could read.<br> Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.<br> Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if I do.<br> I'm sorry, sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention.<br> You feel like going to a convention? - We can't.<br> We're not pharmacists.<br> - I know we're not but Frank Madaio and Eva - Kate Miller.<br> - Kate Miller it is.<br> - Okay.<br> - Oh, good And that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.<br> Well, in that case, should I make sure it's on real good? Thank you.<br> Oh, and then you said that thing about bringing the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century.<br> Well, yeah.<br> That's it? - Yeah.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> We did it.<br> Actually, I did it, Ross.<br> You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.<br> Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products.<br> Oh, this is amazing.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you so much.<br> That's a pretty necklace.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne? Yeah! Save the cork, and that way, we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.<br> Oh, my God, I love you.<br> This is such a cute picture of Emma.<br> And is this your son or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation? That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.<br> - Your first marriage? - Yeah.<br> You've been married more than once? No.<br> So why'd you break up? Oh, it was It's complicated, you know? She was gay.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> This is so cool! Okay.<br> Odd thing to get excited about.<br> No, it's just that I was engaged to a guy who turned out to be gay.<br> Hey! High-five! Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiance was always going on long weekends with his "tennis partner.<br>" My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with every day for a year.<br> She didn't get any fitter.<br> - Everybody's like, "I knew all along.<br>" - I know.<br> If you knew, why didn't you tell me? I mean, call, leave a note.<br> "Hi.<br> Just dropped by to say your wife's gay.<br>" - I know.<br> - And then And then you try to make the best of a bad situation so you float the idea of a threesome.<br> I didn't do that.<br> Me neither.<br> Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.<br> I know.<br> That old lady at the end was ready to take you home.<br> Not enough pills in the world, Rach.<br> What about you, huh? You're the single one.<br> See anybody in there you like? Well, let's see.<br> There was that really big guy that I was talking to with the really nice breasts.<br> But what about back home? Anything going on there? Anybody you like? No.<br> - There is.<br> You're blushing.<br> - No, I'm not blushing and I'm sunburned.<br> From, you know, the rain.<br> You like someone.<br> Tell me who.<br> - Tell me who it is.<br> Come on.<br> - No.<br> Joey.<br> Who do you like? You're not getting away that easy.<br> - Who do you like? - Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know? It's not like anything's gonna happen.<br> What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get? Okay.<br> Okay.<br> You really want to know who it is? - Yeah.<br> Who is it? - Do you? - Oh, hey.<br> - I just left you a message.<br> Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite but now that you're here, we could have that dinner.<br> Right! Of course.<br> Hey, did you guys finish the speech? Yep! We got it.<br> We got it.<br> Thank you so much.<br> - I had a great time.<br> - Yeah.<br> This isn't over, because I really want to know Later.<br> Later.<br> - So shall we? - Yeah.<br> - Okay.<br> - Good night.<br> Good night.<br> - Okay, good night.<br> - Good night, Ross.<br> I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David.<br> She's clearly in love with Mike.<br> You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.<br> Phoebe, I have something I want to say.<br> Oh, God, he's gonna do it.<br> I cannot watch this.<br> Let's go.<br> I think we have time.<br> Have you heard him talk? "Phoebe, I would be honored if" Spit it out, David! Phoebe.<br> You're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was unbearable.<br> Of course, the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help.<br> Sure.<br> Okay.<br> Yeah.<br> But, well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart.<br> So to that end - Oh, my God, Mike.<br> - It's David, actually.<br> No, Mike's here.<br> Oh, hey, Mike.<br> Hi, David.<br> Chandler.<br> Monic Oh! It's the humidity! - Hi, Phoebe.<br> - What are you doing here? I have a question I need to ask you.<br> I have a question I was kind of gonna ask her myself.<br> Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.<br> Okay.<br> - Would you care for my seat as well? - Actually, yeah, that'd be great.<br> Well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.<br> Phoebe, I love you.<br> I've missed you so much these last few months.<br> I thought we were apart for a good reason but I realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.<br> Kind of steps on the toes of what I was going to say.<br> I'm sorry, David, but she really has to know this.<br> All right, but after this, I want to see you outside.<br> If the rain stops.<br> You're the most incredible woman I've ever met.<br> How could I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring.<br> - I have a ring.<br> - I wouldn't brag about that, big guy.<br> But, Phoebe will you marry me? No.<br> I love you, but I never needed a proposal from you.<br> I just needed to know we were headed somewhere.<br> - That we had a future.<br> - We can have any future you want.<br> Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.<br> David, I'm so sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Just so I know, if I had asked first? Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would've been wrong.<br> Please, you don't have to explain.<br> I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us, and I wouldn't have ruined my career.<br> Or lost that toe to frostbite.<br> It was a good trip.<br> - Is it okay if I hug you now? - Oh, yes.<br> Because of our meddling! All right? Oh, isn't this nice? It's so quiet.<br> I could just lie here all day.<br> Oh, I know.<br> - Open your drapes! Open your drapes! - So glad we got adjoining rooms.<br> - The sun is out! - Hey! Remember when I had corneas? Go to the pool and reserve chairs.<br> - I will get the magazines and the lotion.<br> - Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.<br> - No! - Damn it! Walls are pretty thin, guys.<br> "Then we have to weigh the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of carbon dating.<br>" Look at the woman sitting out by the pool getting tan.<br> She's all leathery and wrinkled.<br> I'm so jealous! "Finally, factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered.<br> Giganotosaurus.<br> "- Argentinosaurus.<br>" - Not to mention "Coldsaurus.<br>" "And that's just the herbivores.<br> I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores.<br> Their heads are already too big.<br> Which is ironic, considering their stunted cerebral development.<br>" Really? "But all kidding aside, in much the same way that "Homo ergaster" is thought to be a separate species from "Homo erectus"" - What? - He said "erectus.<br>" - You're kidding, right? - No, he really said it.<br> "And while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossils and the example of "Homo erectus"" "Erectus"? - Homo.<br> - Right.<br> "In a very real way, we can bring the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century.<br>" Thank you.<br> - Really great.<br> - Oh, thanks, guys.<br> I thought it was wonderful.<br> Jarvis Oberblau.<br> Cornell.<br> I mean, the ideas you put forth, and from someone so young and Okay, now we're just holding hands.<br> Alrighty.<br> We're gonna hit the beach.<br> That was really great.<br> - Oh, thank you.<br> - Yeah.<br> Oh, and so funny.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - All right, thanks.<br> Thanks so much.<br> I can't tell you how much it means that you were here.<br> You kidding? We wouldn't have missed it.<br> I'm back.<br> Okay.<br> Well, excuse me? - Well? - You were incredible.<br> You blew them away.<br> I can't tell you how great it was to look in the crowd and see your face.<br> I mean, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me? - I was not.<br> - No, it's okay.<br> It made me feel like a rock star.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I'm your groupie.<br> Hey, I better not find you naked in my hotel room.<br> Look, I took it too far.<br> I can't believe it's raining again.<br> It's so unfair.<br> Well, on the bright side, now we won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.<br> Not you guys.<br> You've got it going on.<br> - What will we do today? - They have a game room downstairs.<br> They have Ping-Pong and stuff.<br> Ping-Pong? Honey, they have Ping-Pong.<br> - Let's play.<br> - I don't think so.<br> - Why not? - You know how competitive you get.<br> And while I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying.<br> - I'm not always that bad.<br> - Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time? I punched you.<br> - And? - Phoebe.<br> - And? - I clunked your heads together.<br> - There you are.<br> - Hey.<br> Listen.<br> As soon as it stops raining, we have got to go snorkeling.<br> Some kid told me about this sea turtle.<br> If you blow bubbles in his face he chases you.<br> I'm sorry, I can't.<br> I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.<br> That's okay.<br> I'll find someone else to do it.<br> I'd do it alone, but I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you.<br> You know, I feel so bad.<br> I haven't seen you this whole trip.<br> Especially last night Don't worry about it.<br> It was fine.<br> I had the best time with Rachel.<br> I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room working on Ross' speech.<br> Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.<br> Oh, well, at least we're both having fun, right? - Is it weird that it's not with each other? - Yeah.<br> A little bit, yeah.<br> I think we need to talk.<br> Yeah, I think we do.<br> About what? - Come on, you guys, it'll be fun! - All right.<br> - I'll play if we don't keep score.<br> - Well, then how do we know who wins? - Nobody wins.<br> - So we're just four losers.<br> Super.<br> - Well, I'm not playing with her.<br> - I'm out.<br> - I'll play you.<br> - Okay.<br> - You don't know what you're doing.<br> - She gets crazy.<br> This scar? That's from Pictionary.<br> I think I'll be all right.<br> - You want to volley a bit for serve? - Sure, if you want to.<br> Oh, by the way, I'm awesome.<br> Oh, dear God, there's two of them.<br> - You ready to play? - Hell, yeah.<br> - Did you know this about him? - No idea.<br> I thought he was soft like you.<br> - Want to make it more interesting? - How much you thinking? - Ten bucks a game? - Make it 50.<br> - I'll make it 100.<br> - One thousand Okay! We'll flip to see who goes first.<br> You got a quarter? No.<br> Either of you girls got a quarter? Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him.<br> - Monica, you call it.<br> - Heads.<br> No, tails! Heads! - Tails.<br> - Oh, what are the chances? - My point! - Oh, no, I don't think so.<br> Standard rules: If at any time a player uses his nonracket-bearing hand to touch the playing surface, he or she forfeits the point.<br> He was a lawyer.<br> All the East Coast is having beautiful weather.<br> "In New York", "it's 72 and sunny.<br>" Weather bitch.<br> It's open.<br> - Hi, Joe.<br> - Hey.<br> - What? Is everything okay? - Charlie and I broke up.<br> No.<br> Why? Well, she said we have nothing in common.<br> That's crazy.<br> No, it's not.<br> We have nothing in common.<br> - Yeah, that's true.<br> - Yeah.<br> I mean, she should be with someone more like Ross.<br> You know, I mean he uses all those big words too.<br> - Man, smart people are dull.<br> - Well, hey! Okay, Rach.<br> I feel so stupid, you know? Why do I keep going after the wrong girls? - What are you talking about? - Oh, come on.<br> I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie.<br> It's like What the hell's my problem? I just Okay.<br> Maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl.<br> I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me.<br> - I'm not talking about her.<br> - Well, then, who? The waitress I went out with last month? - You know what?
