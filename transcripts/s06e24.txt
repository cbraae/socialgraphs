That was my guess! What? What? What? I guessed $20,000.<br> Joey, it is an auction.<br> You don't guess.<br> You buy! What? I don't have $20,000.<br> Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani.<br> Joey, sit down.<br> Forget her.<br> You enjoy this.<br> What are you doing? "One nation.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br> " I remembered it.<br> The champagne is here.<br> -Are you okay? -Yes.<br> Yes.<br> I'm good.<br> Are you good? Are you perfect? Yeah.<br> I'm okay.<br> I'm a little cold.<br> Can I have your jacket? No, you can't have my jacket.<br> Because then I would be cold.<br> If you thought you'd be cold, you should have brought a jacket.<br> Other than that, are you okay? Are you sure you're okay? Yes.<br> I'm fine.<br> In fact, I've been fine for a long time now and I think.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the reason is you.<br> That's sweet.<br> Before I met you, I had really little life.<br> And I couldn't imagine growing old-- Oh, my God.<br> -I know.<br> But let me say it.<br> -Oh, my God.<br> Richard.<br> What? I'm Chandler.<br> Oh, that's Richard.<br> Maybe he won't see us.<br> Richard! Monica.<br> Chandler.<br> I don't know why I did that.<br> -It's good to see you.<br> -You too.<br> You let your hair grow.<br> Oh, that's right, you always wanted me to.<br> I see your mustache is back.<br> Well, my nose got lonely.<br> And you don't have a mustache, which is good.<br> I'm Chandler.<br> I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Lisa, Monica, Chandler.<br> We used to date.<br> No one's supposed to know about us! See, I did it again.<br> -Chandler, sit down.<br> -I'll sit down.<br> Good to see you.<br> Your table is ready, sir.<br> Good to see you guys.<br> If you prefer, this table's available.<br> That might be fun.<br> What were you thinking? I didn't know it was an auction.<br> I figured I'd take a guess.<br> Help a charity.<br> Free boat! Why would a charity give away a free boat? I don't know.<br> Charity? Well, just buy the damn boat.<br> Don't you think you've had enough to drink? I'm just helping the kids.<br> How is you drinking helping the kids? Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.<br> Mr.<br> Tribbiani.<br> Your contribution brings us.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>a big step closer to building the youth center.<br> Just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth? I think it was valued at 1 9,000.<br> Hey, I was pretty close.<br> So, bad news.<br> I can't buy the boat.<br> I don't have any money.<br> Joey! Joey, good one! Good! Very good! -So I think I'm gonna take off now.<br> -You can't leave, Joey! You agreed to buy that boat.<br> It is a contract.<br> Plus, if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me.<br> I don't have that kind of money.<br> I know.<br> Okay, okay, okay, okay.<br> This is what we'll do.<br> We'll go to the next highest bidder, and we'll let them buy it.<br> Then you're just gonna pay the difference.<br> Okay.<br> I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway.<br> They should just watch TV after school like I did.<br> And I turned out fine.<br> Not great.<br> So we're hiding in the bathroom.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Then I sneak out.<br> But before Monica can, her parents come in.<br> I hid in the shower, next thing you know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they're going at it on the floor.<br> Oh, my God! I got a good one.<br> I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.<br> It's so great seeing you guys again.<br> I'd like to make a toast.<br> As a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Iet there be laughter and sharing of pleasures.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>for in the dew of little things.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.<br> " What? Oh, my God! You guys! Have we got a story for you.<br> Guess who we bumped into? -Who? -Richard! I thought you were going out.<br> I was.<br> She was a little busy with a water balloon fight.<br> Sometimes grownups have commitments they can't get out of.<br> Maybe she is too young for me.<br> When I was over there, I felt like I was a babysitter.<br> I finally see what you were talking about.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> Just weigh the good stuff about the relationship against the bad.<br> That's what I did when I first started weighing stuff.<br> Okay, bad stuff.<br> I'm 1 2 years older than she is.<br> If school finds out, you're fired.<br> -She's leaving for three months.<br> -For camp.<br> Okay, good stuff.<br> Well, she's sweet and pretty and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> The only question you need to ask is, do you see a future? Do you see yourself marrying her? My God.<br> You married her, didn't you? No, I didn't do that.<br> It's just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Honestly, no, I don't see a big future with her.<br> Okay, I think that's your answer.<br> I gotta talk to her.<br> I hate this part.<br> Forget Elizabeth.<br> If you're not careful.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you may not get married at all this year.<br> -Next highest bidder is at table one.<br> -Great.<br> The guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.<br> -You care about the guy who won? -It's a trip for two.<br> Excuse me.<br> Is the person who won the Paris trip at this table? -That was me.<br> -EnchantÃ©.<br> -Is there a Mr.<br> Bowmont at this table? -That's me.<br> Hello.<br> This is your lucky day, Mr.<br> Bowmont.<br> The Gentleman Daysailer has become available again.<br> I believe you made a bid of $1 8,000? You have to pay that.<br> It's not just a guess.<br> I was actually relieved I didn't win the boat.<br> My wife would've killed me.<br> Are you kidding? She'll love this boat! -What is your wife's name? -It's Pam.<br> It's Pam.<br> Just imagine this.<br> The Pam.<br> I don't think she'd like that.<br> Imagine this: The Mr.<br> Bowmont.<br> I don't think so.<br> Let me paint you a little picture.<br> You are setting sail up the Hudson.<br> You've got the wind in your arms.<br> You get all that peace and quiet you've always wanted.<br> You get back to nature.<br> You can go fishing.<br> You get one of those hats, people call you captain.<br> And then when you're old, Cappy.<br> It's for a good cause.<br> All right! -No way! It's mine! -What? The stuff you said, I want that! But, Joey, you don't have $20,000! Who cares? I'll make payments! I want the Mr.<br> Bowmont! You're back! Let me see your hand! Why do you want to see my hand? I want to see what's in your hand, the trash.<br> It's all dirty.<br> You should throw this out.<br> -What did you just do? -What happened? -Richard was there.<br> I couldn't do it.<br> -Oh, no.<br> I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.<br> Now you've ruined it.<br> We didn't.<br> You walk in here and ask to see her hand! A palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor.<br> -Glove salesman.<br> -Good one! This is terrible.<br> What am I gonna do? She only suspects something.<br> So just throw her off the track.<br> I'll make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.<br> Convince her you're scared of commitment.<br> I can do that.<br> I've had 30 years of practice.<br> Being you is finally gonna pay off! Had to go to the basement.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>some idiot keeps stuffing the chute with pizza boxes.<br> That guy's still doing that? My God, let me see your hand! No, you're too late! She already took out the trash! I have never had such a healthy breakup.<br> She was such a grownup about it.<br> She didn 't seem too immature for me.<br> Did ljust make a huge mistake? Ross? Wait! Elizabeth, thank God.<br> I was just thinking about-- You suck! What? Breakup's still on.<br> Here she comes.<br> Do I look like I don't want to get married? And, also, a little like a French guy.<br> I never noticed that before.<br> What are you up to? Just hanging out.<br> Talking about web sites.<br> We saw this interesting web site about marriage.<br> How unnecessary it is.<br> How it's a way for governments to keep tabs on you.<br> Yeah, Big Brother.<br> That's a little crazy.<br> Although I am glad you're looking at other things on the lnternet.<br> Got me thinking, why would anybody want to get married? To celebrate the relationship.<br> To solidify the commitment.<br> To declare your love for one another to the world.<br> Well, that's good to know.<br> The Mr.<br> Bowmont's here! A customer wants to compliment you.<br> Shall I let him in? Sure! I love this part! -Come on in.<br> -Hi.<br> I'm not here to compliment the chef.<br> I hate when people come back to compliment the chef.<br> Like I've nothing better to do.<br> What's up? It was great seeing you the other night.<br> Good to see you too.<br> Came to tell me that? No.<br> Came here to tell you something else.<br> Came here to tell you I still love you.<br>   <br>
