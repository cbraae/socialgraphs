                    			Okay, here's his diaper bag and his Mr.<br> Winky.<br> And  him.<br> Hi! -How did everything go? -Great! There was a projectile throwing up incident, but he started it.<br> We've gotta go.<br> Oh, right.<br> I've got some news.<br> It's about us.<br> You and me? No.<br> Susan and me.<br> The other "us.<br>" We're getting married.<br> As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married? We'd like you to come.<br> We understand if you don't want to.<br> Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.<br> I just thought that Why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? And I'm reveling, baby! Believe me! Is your finger caught in that chair? Want us to go? The One With the Lesbian Wedding This is cool.<br> You're actually on television.<br> I know.<br> It really hit me last night.<br> I'm on Days of our Lives.<br> Then I started thinking about us, and how these are the days of our lives.<br> Yes! What? Carol and Susan's caterer had a bike accident and she's in a full-body cast.<br> They want me to do it, which is cool since I've never catered and I need the money.<br> Is this a problem for you, isn't it? -Would it matter? -You're so great! Thank you! -You're really not going? -I'm really not.<br> They already live together.<br> Why do they need to get married? They love each other.<br> They wanna celebrate that love with the people close to them.<br> If you wanna call that a reason.<br> Who's the bitterest man in the living room? The bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.<br> -I thought you were over this.<br> -That has nothing to do with it.<br> She is my ex-wife, If she were marrying a guy, you wouldn't expect me to go.<br> If she were marrying a guy, she'd be the worst lesbian ever.<br> Did I miss it? No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.<br> She's pretty.<br> And she's really nice.<br> She taught me about how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.<br> -I'm sorry, what? -Excuse me? smell-the-fart acting You got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.<br> So while you're thinking you take this big pause where you look all intense.<br> Like this.<br> Here's my scene! Here's my scene! Mrs.<br> Wallace? Dr.<br> Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.<br> Is she going to be all right? I'm afraid the situation is much more dire than we'd expected.<br> Your sister's suffering from a subcranial hematoma.<br> Perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.<br> Nice! For a minute, I thought you were actually smelling something.<br> -Do it again! -All right! -That was so good! -Do it again.<br> "Damn it, Braverman! It's right there on the chart!" I gotta get to work.<br> I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.<br> No, that's me.<br> Oh, right.<br> Oh, thanks.<br> Couldn't.<br> Is everything okay? No.<br> One of my clients died on the massage table today.<br> Oh, my God! That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.<br> She was, you know, and her name was Mrs.<br> Adelman.<br> Oh, honey.<br> It's just so strange.<br> You know she probably woke up this morning and thought  I'll have some breakfast, take a walk, then have my massage.<br> Little did she know God thought, "Okay, but that's it.<br>" Oh, but the weirdest things was  I was cleansing her aura when it happened.<br> And when her spirit left her body  I don't think it went very far.<br> What do you mean? I think it went into me.<br> This is so hard.<br> I can't decide between lamb or duck.<br> Well, lambs are scarier.<br> Otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the Ducks.<br> Okay, who ordered what? I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.<br> And this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf? Oh, God.<br> You're so uptight about your mom coming.<br> I know.<br> I just don't want her to think that because  I didn't marry Barry my life is total crap.<br> Talk about crap, just listen to Stella Neidman tell her story about Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.<br> I'm sorry.<br> At least you guys haven't need to hear staff she said in my head.<br> Pheebs? How long do you think this lady will be with us? I don't know.<br> She obviously has some unfinished business.<br> Sit up! There she is! -Mom! -Hey, sweetie! So this is where you work! Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? I guess that's the fun.<br> Pretty much.<br> Here, meet my friends.<br> Monica! You look gorgeous! Oh, my! The last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.<br> This is Joey.<br> This is Phoebe.<br> This is Chandler.<br> You remember Ross? Oh, hello, Ross.<br> Mrs.<br> Greene.<br> What do you think of my daughter, in the apron with the big job! Oh, Mom! If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.<br> Believe me, sometimes that happens.<br> This is just so exciting! You know, I never worked.<br> I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house.<br> I am just so proud of you! Really? Let's make a day of it! We will have lunch, we will shopping, we will get nails done, whatever you want.<br> Mom, I have to work.<br> What! No one else can pour coffee? I know who you remind me of.<br> Evelyn Durmer.<br> That's before the lousy face-lift.<br> Now she looks like Soupy Sales.<br> Pheebs? Who's Evelyn Durmer? I don't know.<br> Who's Soupy Sales? Oh, my God! There's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.<br> Just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.<br> You have some life here, sweetie! Mom, I realize you and dad were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the house in the suburbs with all the security.<br> This is just so much better for me.<br> I do know.<br> You didn't love Barry, honey.<br> And I've never seen you this happy.<br> I look at you and I think, "This is what I want.<br>" For me.<br> Well, not just for you.<br> What do you mean? I'm considering leaving your father.<br> All right, tell me if this is too cute.<br> Lesbian wedding chicken breasts.<br> Oh, God.<br> I think I'm gonna be sick.<br> What? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.<br> Oh! Honey, I'm sorry.<br> Please don't be mad at me.<br> What can I do? You order me to make those martial art trick you used to like.<br> I can call it Carl Meilong to find out how? Mom, I just don't understand.<br> I thought you are happy.<br> So did I.<br> You know sometime you are driving on the highway, and you get home, and you can't actually remember you have driven there.<br> That's kind of my life being like.<br> Coundn't you listen to the radio more? I wish it is that easy.<br> But then I see you here and I keep thinking why can't I have this? I want adventures, I want hang out, I want Chandler.<br> Believe me, Chandler is no reason to leave daddy! You think it's something having a lot of fun, but it's really hard, really hard.<br> I got this lausy job, I barely know how to make it ramdon.<br> Forget about to buying stuff.<br> Honey! You don't understand.<br> I'm be doing what you are doning, but with money.<br> It's very different.<br> -You had no idea what they getting along? -None.<br> They didn't fight a lot? No, they didn't even talk to each other.<br> How was I suppose to know they were having problems? You know, in my day, divorce was not an option.<br> Hey, look who's up! I just can't believe this is happening! When I was little, everybody's parents got divorced.<br> I figured as an grown up, I wouldn't have to worry about it.<br> Can't you look at this as flattering? She just wants to be like you.<br> Well, couldn't she have just copied my haircut? When my parents divorced, they sent me to a shrink and she told me that kids blame themselves.<br> But in your case, it's actually kind of true.<br> Oh, that's him.<br> Damn! My mail-order grandfather hasn't come yet.<br> -Phoebe? -Hi, Mr.<br> Adelman.<br> -Nice to see you.<br> -Thanks for meeting me.<br> That's okay.<br> Although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.<br> Do you wanna sit? No, I spent most of my morning trying to stand up.<br> What can I do for you, my dear? Okay, I don't know how to say this, but.<br> I think when your wife's spirit left her body it kind of stuck around in me.<br> You're saying my wife is in you? Yeah.<br> You don't have to believe me, but can you think of any unfinished business she had? Any reason to hang around? I don't know what to say.<br> All I can think of is that she used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.<br> -Everything? -Everything.<br> That's a lot of stuff.<br> Oh, wait, l.<br> I remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.<br> I'm sorry.<br> There's laughing in my head.<br> Worth a shot, huh? Look at this! These are all Halloween, three years ago.<br> My little matini.<br> I love your oral of hair.<br> Oh, and look, here's Barry.<br> He came straight from the office? Oh, no.<br> That was his costume.<br> See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.<br> He thought that was really funny.<br> You guys? Remember when I said that I don't need your help? Actually, I think you said  "Don't touch that and get out of my kitchen.<br>" Really? Weird.<br> Anyway.<br> I planned really well.<br> I planned and planned.<br> I just didn't plan enough time to do it.<br> -You want some help? -lf you want.<br> What a day! I took her everywhere.<br> The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center the Statue of Liberty.<br> She's still with you? Yes.<br> I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.<br> Be right back.<br> She has to go to the bathroom again.<br> Such a pretty face! Oh, this is so much fun! Just the girls! Do you know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana? God! Did I have to ask do we have pot.<br> Look, no one's smoking pot around all this food.<br> Well, that's fine.<br> I never did it.<br> I just thought I might.<br> What's new in sex? What's new in sex? The only man I've been with is your father.<br> I'm dicing.<br> I'm dicing.<br> I don't hear anything.<br> This is no offense to your dad, but I was thinking there might be more.<br> You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you.<br> All right.<br> You come here and drop this bomb on me before you even tell Daddy.<br> Do you want my blessing? Want me to talk you out of it? Then what do you want? I guess I figured you would understand.<br> Why on earth would I understand this? You didn't marry your Barry, honey.<br> But I married mine.<br> We're in trouble.<br> We've only got Move, move, move! I feel like you should Joey, speed it up! I'm sorry! It's the pigs! They're reluctant to get in the blanket! How did this happen? I thought you had this planned out.<br> Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry? Sir, no, sir! All right, you! No.<br> Look, I told you, I am not a part of this thing.<br> Look, Ross.<br> I know you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.<br> But if you don't help, I'm gonna take those hot dogs and create an appetizer called "Pigs In Ross.<br>" All right, ball a melon! How come I'm stuck dicing when he gets to ball a melon? -How's it going? -Great! Right on schedule.<br> Got my little happy helpers.<br> That's fine.<br> Whatever.<br> What's wrong? Nothing.<br> Okay, everything.<br> I think we're calling off the wedding.<br> You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.<br> What's the matter? What happened? My parents called to say they weren't coming.<br> I knew they were having trouble with this, but they're my parents.<br> They're supposed to give me away.<br> Susan and I fought because I said maybe we should call it off.<br> She said, "This isn't for them.<br> It's for us.<br>" And if I couldn't see that, we should cancel the wedding.<br> I don't know what to do.<br> I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.<br> You do? Do you love her? And don't be too emphatic about this.<br> Of course I do.<br> Well then, that's it.<br> If George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them.<br> If my parents didn't want me to marry you  no way that would've stopped me.<br> Look, this is your wedding.<br> Do it.<br> You're right.<br> Of course you're right.<br> So we're back on? We're back on.<br> You heard the woman! Peel! Chop! Devil! Can't believe I lost two minutes! It just seems so futile.<br> You know? All these women, and nothing! I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.<br> Well, now you understand how I feel every single day.<br> The world is my lesbian wedding.<br> Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Anytime.<br> Ross.<br> Nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love.<br> Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.<br> Oh, my God! Now I've seen everything! She's gone! She's gone! She's gone.<br> Go ahead, get married.<br> Go, go! Strangers in the night Exchanging glances Wondering in the night Would you look at them? Yeah.<br> Can't help but.<br> How's that pig-in-the-blanket working out for you? I wrapped those bad boys.<br> I miss Rose.<br> Oh, yeah? I know it's kind of weird, but she was a big part of my life.<br> I don't know, I feel alone.<br> You know, I couldn't help overhearing what you just said.<br> I think it's time you forget about Rose, move on with your life.<br> How about we get you a drink? Okay.<br> So nice! I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? Hey, Mom, having fun? Am l! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman.<br> And three other girls made eyes at me over at the buffet.<br> I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue  but it's nice to know I have options.<br> There's more alcohol, right? How you doing? You did a good thing today.<br> You wanna dance? No, that's fine.<br> Come on.<br> I'll let you lead.<br> Look, penis, schmenis! Okay? We're all people.<br> Which one of us is gonna be the first one to get married? Mon, I was married.<br> -Yeah, me too, technically.<br> -I had a wedding.<br> Just trying to start a discussion.<br> Which one do you think will be the last to get married? Isn't Ben in this? Of course! Absolutely.<br>   <br>
