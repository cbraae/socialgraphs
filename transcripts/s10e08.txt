                    			- Hey, guys.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> - Hey.<br> We need to talk about something.<br> Yeah.<br> We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.<br> - What? - Are you kidding? Well, it's just with work and the stress of adoption we don't feel like we have the energy.<br> Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.<br> That doesn't sound like you.<br> That's Monica talking.<br> - No, we made this decision together.<br> - She's putting words in your mouth.<br> Don't you put words in people's mouths.<br> You put turkey in people's mouths.<br> I can't believe this.<br> This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.<br> - No, it's not.<br> - It's not? When was she born? Well, personally, I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.<br> - Thank you, Pheebs.<br> - Sure.<br> It's just as well.<br> I mean, last year wasn't very good.<br> I think she's losing her touch.<br> - What? You are way off, lady.<br> - Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong.<br> Well, think about it.<br> You'd be trying to top what you did last year.<br> You'd be in competition with yourself.<br> That's my favorite kind.<br> Okay, we are doing this.<br> Don't let yourself get manipulated this way.<br> Stay out of this, Chandler.<br> This is between me and me.<br> We are supposed to make these decisions together.<br> Did you not watch the Dr.<br> Phil I taped for you? The One With The Late Thanksgiving - Hey.<br> - Hi.<br> Happy Thanksgiving.<br> Happy Meatless Turkey-Murder Day.<br> You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleeker.<br> - Could you pick them up for me? - You're not making the pies? I don't make chocolate pies.<br> When I was younger, I entered this pie-eating contest.<br> I ate so many that the thought of them makes me sick.<br> Did you at least win the contest? Two minutes, twelve pies and a part of one tin.<br> - Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.<br> - Can't wait.<br> This dinner is gonna be so great.<br> In your face, last-year me.<br> - Hey, Rach? - Yeah.<br> What's Emma doing today? Well, let's see, I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop.<br> - Why? - I want to enter her in a baby pageant.<br> Oh, my God.<br> That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard.<br> Okay, but before you say no, my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.<br> And compared to Emma, she's a real dog.<br> - Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.<br> - Oh, okay.<br> No.<br> Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy - And a thousand dollars.<br> is something I'm very interested in.<br> Oh, please, do not tell Ross.<br> He still believes that what's on the inside is important.<br> Okay.<br> And Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.<br> Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving? Well, I was thinking Take the clothes off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid! Did someone drop the baton again? Why come all the way from Kansas to do that? I don't get older, I just get better.<br> You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us.<br> I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.<br> - You don't know that.<br> - Somebody's gonna pick us.<br> But we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency.<br> I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.<br> Next year, it's gonna be you, me and little Hemingway Bing.<br> - What? He's my favorite author.<br> - Name one of his books.<br> The Firm? Okay, let's see.<br> Okay, the turkey's in the oven.<br> The stuffing is ready.<br> You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself.<br> Let me help this year.<br> Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.<br> But you don't have to do everything Dr.<br> Phil tells you to do.<br> I'm serious, let me do something.<br> Just not the turkey.<br> Nothing high-profile.<br> Okay, let's see.<br> Oh, the cranberry sauce.<br> It's easy to make, and no one really cares about it.<br> Tell me more.<br> I'm gonna go check on something across the hall.<br> You start by washing these.<br> Not with soap! You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes.<br> - Hi.<br> Hey, guess what Joey has.<br> - Three tickets to today's Rangers game! Dude, I wanted him to guess.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - Yeah, they're great seats too.<br> - Guess where they are.<br> - Center ice.<br> Did I do something to you? - The game's at 1.<br> - So? - Dinner's at 4.<br> We'll never make it back.<br> - So we'll leave before it's over.<br> But it could take us a long time to get back home.<br> Plus, Joey could get lost and they could have to page us to go pick him up.<br> Dude, two times that happened! Look, Monica's been working hard all day.<br> She didn't want to host in the first place.<br> We shouldn't go.<br> He's right, man.<br> - Yeah, I guess.<br> So we'll see you at 4.<br> - Okay.<br> And get ready to taste my very special cranberries.<br> Or should I say "Chan-berries"? That's some gentle comedy, dude.<br> - We're still going to the game, right? - Yeah.<br> This is contestant number 16, Rebecca Hope from Yonkers.<br> - Hey.<br> - Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.<br> This place is freaking me out.<br> I've been watching this guy over there.<br> I don't think he came with a kid.<br> But we can't leave now.<br> There was this one baby, Haley, who was favored to win she got croup, so she had to stay home.<br> This competition just blew wide-open, folks.<br> Phoebe, it's just too weird.<br> I just saw a 1 -year-old with pantyhose on.<br> Oh, I know.<br> We should've been more prepared.<br> It's okay.<br> Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron.<br> My God, they just took her sweater off.<br> Look at those arms.<br> Hello, Michelin Man.<br> Phoebe, come on.<br> You know what, it's already 3:00.<br> They haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet.<br> We got dinner.<br> But Emma's got what it takes.<br> She could go all the way! - Phoebe, you have to calm down.<br> - Okay.<br> Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now.<br> I overheard a judge say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma.<br> - Really? - Yeah.<br> - You heard him say that? - Yeah.<br> All right.<br> Okay.<br> All right, let's give these babies something to cry about.<br> Good.<br> Let's get down to business.<br> Emma needs some makeup.<br> What? She's gonna look washed-out next to the others.<br> No, I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby.<br> - Why not? - Because I already did.<br> You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot! - What a game.<br> - I know.<br> Yeah.<br> - I can't believe Chandler's missing this.<br> - I'm sorry he's not here.<br> But I gotta say, I am really enjoying nacho chair.<br> Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.<br> - Yeah! - These seats are great.<br> I know, I know.<br> When I was here for "Holidays on Ice" I was sitting so far away, Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.<br> We'd better get going.<br> If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.<br> But it's a tie game.<br> So we're a little late.<br> The girls will be there.<br> Let's just stay for one more goal.<br> - I don't know.<br> - One more fight.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> Where is everybody? They're 45 minutes late.<br> I can't believe they're not here.<br> I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined Cranberry Day.<br> - How late are we? - Forty-five minutes.<br> - Here.<br> - Okay.<br> Rachel and Phoebe are already there, so they probably started without us.<br> We could just slip in, and no one needs to know where we were.<br> - You may want to lose the foam finger.<br> - Oh, no, no, no.<br> You just want to put it on your hand.<br> - You're not at Thanksgiving? - No, we're late.<br> - What are you doing here? - We're late too.<br> We figured we could be late because you'd be on time.<br> Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.<br> - Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.<br> - Yeah, where were you? - Well - Yeah, what's with the trophy? Well, we were at a spelling bee.<br> And I won.<br> You won an adult Thanksgiving Day spelling bee? Yes.<br> Y-E-S.<br> Yes.<br> Let me see this.<br> "Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division"? That's me.<br> You entered Emma in a beauty pageant? And it looks like she put makeup on her.<br> Wait a second.<br> Where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before? I can't believe this.<br> She's our daughter.<br> That you would treat her like some kind of show dog is inexcusable.<br> - She won a thousand dollars.<br> - So this is an annual thing? That's Alicia May Emory's outfit! Guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier.<br> - What are we gonna do? - I gotta put Emma down for a nap.<br> And, Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia May.<br> - All right, what are we gonna say? - We'll say that we were mugged.<br> You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged.<br> Good.<br> But you don't look like you were mugged.<br> No.<br> Here.<br> Hey! Do you hear something? - They're out there.<br> - Let me see.<br> I can't believe this.<br> They're an hour late, and they're just standing there talking.<br> Everything's so distorted.<br> It looks like Joey has a giant hand.<br> That says "Rangers" on it.<br> They went to the game.<br> Oh, they are in for a world of pain.<br> - Ross' shirt is torn.<br> - They're late and they're sloppy.<br> All right, Emma's napping.<br> What happened to your shirt? I got mugged, and they stole my pocket.<br> We're just trying to figure out an excuse.<br> How about this? We could say that Monica told us 5:00, not 4:00.<br> That way we're right on time.<br> Or we could plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.<br> That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.<br> We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.<br> We'll just act casual.<br> We're not late, we're right on time.<br> "We know you're out there.<br>" Who do you think it's from? Oh, God, this is bad.<br> This is so bad.<br> Well, let's just go in there and face them.<br> I'm not going in first.<br> I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.<br> I hate that thing.<br> It's like a bolt of lightning.<br> Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors, and whoever loses, goes in first.<br> - All right, I'm in.<br> - Ready.<br> I win.<br> - What is that? - That's fire.<br> It beats everything.<br> Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.<br> Well-played.<br> All right, let's all go in at the same time.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> - It's locked.<br> - What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.<br> When they're having sex on the couch, it's like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy!" All right, come on.<br> All right, you guys, we're so sorry we're late.<br> Please let us in so we can have dinner together.<br> No, everything's cold.<br> The turkey's dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.<br> Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that's What happens to cranberry sauce? - Nothing, it's fine.<br> - Oh, thank God.<br> Come on, you guys, we're sorry.<br> Our subway broke down.<br> That's a lie! You went to the game.<br> I can see Joey's hand.<br> For the love of God, take it off! Guys, it doesn't matter why we're late.<br> We're all here now.<br> Please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.<br> I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.<br> That's all the turkey you're gonna get.<br> - How are we gonna decide who gets this? - Water balloon! What are we gonna do? I'm starving.<br> I just remembered, we do have something to eat.<br> Monica put something in our oven this morning.<br> You touch that, and you will be sorry! Guys, I'd listen to her.<br> The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it! Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts! That's worse than no food.<br> All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts.<br> Stinky? Please let me stay on this side of the door.<br> Oh, I know! I still have my old key.<br> We can just unlock the door.<br> I don't know if that's a good idea.<br> They don't wanna be with us.<br> I don't wanna be with them either but it's Thanksgiving, and we should not want to be together together.<br> If I could just get in there, make a face-to-face apology Iook them in the eye, I could get them to forgive us.<br> - I don't know.<br> - I'm telling you I can do it.<br> Yeah, he can do it.<br> It all looks so beautiful.<br> - The turkey, the stuffing.<br> - The cranberries.<br> Enough! A monkey could've made them.<br> Hey, listen, guys, we feel really terrible.<br> He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.<br> Don't look at him.<br> Don't look at him.<br> Come on, you guys.<br> We want you to know we're very, very sorry.<br> Right, guys? - I feel terrible.<br> - Oh, so sorry.<br> But let's not ruin this day.<br> You've worked so hard.<br> Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh? The floating heads do make a good point.<br> Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.<br> - So bad.<br> - So bad.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, you two go get the dessert, and I'll let you in.<br> Dessert? Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies.<br> You did remember, right? Pies.<br> Oh, we thought you said "prize.<br>" Here.<br> - "Grand Supreme Little Darling"? - Congratulations! Oh, my God, you forgot the pies? Well, I cannot believe this.<br> You forced me to make dinner, you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.<br> Really, girls, not cool.<br> Well, you man-heads aren't any better.<br> You lied about going to the game.<br> You knew it'd make you late, and you went anyway.<br> Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.<br> We said we're sorry.<br> It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness.<br> - It's a day to be thankful.<br> - Don't make me come up there! It's too late for apologies.<br> Fine, let's just go.<br> I don't need your stupid dinner.<br> That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.<br> - Oh, is that what that is? - Sorry.<br> Come on, you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.<br> - Yeah, I'll cook.<br> - Yeah, let's go out.<br> Yeah, you three have a nice Thanksgiving.<br> - The three of us? - Yeah.<br> You, Chan and the vein.<br> - I'm stuck.<br> - Joey, that is not gonna work.<br> No, seriously.<br> - I'm really wedged in here.<br> - I'll pull you through.<br> Okay.<br> Stop, stop, I'm worried about damaging my head.<br> It's a little late for that.<br> Hurry up, you gotta do something.<br> All right, well, this does not change anything.<br> We need to get something to grease his face.<br> - We got turkey grease.<br> - Bring it.<br> I just want to say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a separate person.<br> Here you go.<br> Oh, that smells good.<br> - Okay? - Okay, try it.<br> It isn't working.<br> - We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.<br> - Hurry, I can't feel my ears.<br> Can you ever feel your ears? Interesting.<br> - Chandler, where are your tools? - Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.<br> I don't have tools.<br> - Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.<br> - I lent them to Ross.<br> - I gave them to Joey.<br> - I left them at the park.<br> I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.<br> I stuffed Brussels sprouts down his pants.<br> Nice.<br> Okay, I have to get that.<br> Now, when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone.<br> Thanksgiving is over.<br> The vein has spoken.<br> - It's really starting to hurt.<br> - Look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push.<br> Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so push.<br> Just a sec.<br> We're kind of in the middle of something here.<br> Hey, stop putting things down my pants.<br> - Come on, guys, push! - Yeah, come on, push! Push! Push! - My cranberries! - Man, I got food all over me.<br> I can't believe what you did.<br> Monica's gonna kill you.<br> Look! Look! Look what the Look what the floating heads did! I don't care.<br> What's going on? That was the adoption agency.<br> And? - We're getting a baby! - Are you serious?! There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us.<br> - Oh, my God, that's great! - That's incredible.<br> I'm so happy for you.<br> This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass! To Monica and Chandler and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.<br> I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.<br> - I know.<br> - Have you considered pageanting? I can't believe they called.<br> I mean, we're actually getting a baby.<br> I know how you feel.<br> - Really? - Sure.<br> I went through the exact same thing with Alicia May Emory.<br> The waiting, the wondering.<br> Then one day, I get that call from Toys"R"Us.<br> She was in stock.<br> That is the exact same thing.<br>   <br>
