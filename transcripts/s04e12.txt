                    			What the hell is that?! What the hell is that? Is that you? -You're really not a morning person.<br> -Just back off! Get up! Get up! Get up! What is that noise? You! It's the chick.<br> She's going through some changes.<br> What kind of changes? The vet seems to think she's becoming a rooster.<br> We're getting a second opinion.<br> The One With the Embryos Why are you shopping at 8 in the morning? I've been up since 6 thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.<br> You should get rid of those animals.<br> They shouldn't be in an apartment.<br> Especially not with these knives and cookbooks around.<br> I'm going to the doctor and see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.<br> How will they know? They'll just see if my endometrial layer is thick.<br> I can check that for you.<br> Okay, think "thick.<br>" Good luck! Wish me luck.<br> Good luck.<br> -I'm still right.<br> -That is so not true.<br> What? I know it's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old-lady underpants.<br> I can check that for you.<br> You two think you know me and Rachel better than we know you.<br> Well, we do.<br> You can only eat Tic Tacs in even numbers.<br> What's that about? And you! Ross, if you check Rachel's bag you'll find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.<br> You're good.<br> These are not.<br> I'm so not impressed.<br> Everybody snacks when they shop.<br> Ross, how many items left in that bag? Five.<br> Okay, 10 bucks says we can name every item in that bag.<br> -How many guesses? -Six.<br> Challenge extended.<br> -Deal! -Challenge accepted.<br> All right, we'll start with apples.<br> We'll be starting with apples.<br> Stop that now.<br> Yes.<br> Okay.<br> Tortilla chips.<br> -Yogurt.<br> -Diet soda.<br> -Orange juice.<br> -There's no orange juice! We win! They have another guess.<br> Well, we won that one.<br> Okay.<br> The last thing is Not for another two weeks.<br> I got it.<br> Scotch tape.<br> How did you know she would buy Scotch tape? We used up theirs last night making scary faces.<br> Oh, man! All right! Ten bucks.<br> Fork it over.<br> Cough it up.<br> Pay the piper.<br> Give me it! You don't know us better.<br> I want a rematch.<br> And no stupid grocery questions.<br> Real, personal questions.<br> And the winner gets $100.<br> -Serious? -Are you scared? No.<br> Who makes up the questions? Ross will do it.<br> Sure, Ross will do it.<br> It's not like he has a job or a child or a life of his own.<br> -Fine.<br> We'll ask Phoebe.<br> -No, I want to play.<br> Looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.<br> I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.<br> Okay, so what's now? Go get the eggs.<br> Put them in there.<br> It'll take a little while to prepare the embryos.<br> -Embryos? As in more than one? -Five, actually.<br> Where am I giving birth in a hospital or a big box under the stairs? Doing five gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.<br> That's it? 25%? That means that it's, like, I was thinking, what are the odds if you stuff 200 of them in there? Sweetie, now she's a woman, not a gumball machine.<br> Don't worry.<br> I'll do this as many times as it takes to get it right.<br> The thing is, we kind of only have one shot.<br> It costs $16,000 each time you do this.<br> Sixteen thousand dollars?! Well, it's 20 in California.<br> We're kind of using all the money we have to do it this one time.<br> Okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.<br> Maybe there's something I can do to make sure I get pregnant.<br> No, I'm sorry.<br> Wow, you guys really don't know anything.<br> Why don't you get drunk? It worked for a bunch of girls in my high school.<br> -So how's the test coming? -Hey, you're touching the game board.<br> Sorry.<br> You freak.<br> Do you realize that any minute now Phoebe could be pregnant? I know, I know.<br> It's such a huge, life-altering thing.<br> The test is ready.<br> Okay.<br> Each team will answer 10 questions.<br> The first team to answer the most questions wins.<br> The categories are "Fears and Pet Peeves" "Ancient History" "Literature" and "It's all Relative.<br>" Now the coin toss, to see who goes first.<br> Okay.<br> Somebody call it this time.<br> Tails!
