I know.<br> I got to go.<br> I got to go break up with Bonnie.<br> Here? Now? I can't stay here all night.<br> If I go in there, she'll want to do stuff.<br> Can't you say you aren't in the mood? No, she likes that.<br> Faking sleep doesn't work.<br> I've woken up many times with her -Why am I telling you? -I don't know.<br> -Not every morning -Making it worse! The One with the Jellyfish You probably want to know how it happened.<br> I think I can figure it out.<br> I was born, and then everyone lied their asses off.<br> No, it wasn't like that.<br> Remember how I said Lilly, Frank and I were close? We were very close.<br> How close? The three of us were kind of a couple.<br> I don't know how that would work.<br> I'm not asking! Anyhow, somehow I got pregnant and I was scared.<br> I was stupid and selfish.<br> I was 18 years old.<br> Remember what it was like to be 18? Mom killed herself and my dad ran off.<br> I lived in a Gremlin with a guy who talked to his hand.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I thought I'd left you with the best parents.<br> I didn't hear about them till a few years ago.<br> By then, you were already grown-up.<br> You're here and I would really like to get to know you.<br> Well, everybody does.<br> I'm a really cool person.<br> You had 29 years to find out, but you didn't even try.<br> You walked out on me, and I'll do the same.<br> I don't ever want to see you again.<br> Where's my purse? Shoot! We're out of soda.<br> -I'll get you some.<br> -Really? No, because I'm not your boyfriend.<br> Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go? My mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth mom.<br> I found a dried-up seahorse.<br> What do you mean? My new mom, who's a big fat abandoner.<br> Don't you want to stay here and talk about it? I need to be alone.<br> Man.<br> Hey what if you found out that your mom wasn't really your mom and your new mom turned out to be really hot? Oh, man, huh? But, it's your mom.<br> No, I'm talking about your mom.<br> It's over.<br> Was it awful? It was long.<br> I didn't realize how late it was till I saw the five o'clock shadow on her head.<br> She didn't want to stay.<br> I called a cab.<br> She just left.<br> I wrote you a letter.<br> Oh, thank you! I like mail.<br> It's just some things I've been thinking about.<br> About us.<br> Before we even think about us getting back together I need to know how you feel about this stuff.<br> It's 5:30 in the morning.<br> So I'd better get cracking on this baby.<br> I'll be waiting for you.<br> Come up when you're done.<br> I'll be up in 18 pages.<br> Front and back.<br> Very exciting! What happened to you? Why didn't you come up? Done.<br> -You just finished? -I wanted to be thorough.<br> This is clearly very important to you.<br> To us.<br> I wanted to read every word carefully.<br> Twice.<br> Does it? I'm sorry? Does it? Does it? Does it? I wanted to give that whole "Does it?" part another glance.<br> What do you mean? You said you read it twice.<br> It either does or doesn't.<br> If you have to think No, I don't have to think about it.<br> In fact I've decided.<br> I have decided that it does.<br> -Are you sure? -Sure, I'm sure! There's a nuclear holocaust.<br> I'm the last man on earth.<br> Would you go out with me? I've got canned goods.<br> Take a look at this! Check this baby out! Dug me a hole.<br> Excellent hole, Joe.<br> Oh, no! My hole! My foot! What is it? Jellyfish sting! It hurts! Can we help you to the house? It's two miles.<br> And I'm tired from digging.<br> Damn the jellyfish! Damn all the jellyfish! Do something.<br> There's only one thing.<br> What is it? Pee on it.<br> Gross! I saw it on Discovery Channel.<br> He's right.<br> There's ammonia in that that kills the pain.<br> Forget it.<br> It doesn't hurt that bad! You can use my hole for privacy.<br> I'm ready to get the hell out of here.<br> Are you? That's so great! Not for Bonnie.<br> But for you, yea! -How was the beach? -Nothing.<br> I don't know.<br> -What happened? -Nothing.<br> -I'm going to shower.<br> -Me too.<br> Me too.<br> I'll put this in the car.<br> I have to go pack! -And it really does? -lt does.<br> It really and truly does.<br> It so does not! She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong.<br> She goes on for five pages about how I was unfaithful to her.<br> We were on a break! If you say that one more time, I'll break up with you.<br> This breakup was not all my fault.<br> She says here "lf you accept full responsibility I can begin to trust you again.<br> Does that seem like something you can do? Does it?" You have what you want.<br> You're back with her.<br> If you bring this up now, you'll wreck it.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> You're right.<br> I'll let it go.<br> But you know how hard it is to forget this? Sure, it's hard but you don't have to talk about it.<br> A lot happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.<br> What happened on that beach? It's between us and the sea, Ross.<br> Hi, Ursula.<br> I know that we haven't talked in a long time.<br> Our mom is not our birth mom.<br> This other lady is our birth mom.<br> Right, the one that lives in Montauk.<br> You know her? No.<br> I read about her in Mom's suicide note.<br> There was a suicide note? Do you still have it? Hang on.<br> I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note.<br> Yeah, so how have you been doing? Shut up! "Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.<br> I'll miss you.<br> P.<br>S.<br> Your mom lives in Montauk.<br>" You just wrote this! It's pretty much the gist.<br> Except for the poem.<br> You read the poem, right? All right.<br> Hang on.<br> Pass the cheese, please.<br> You can't even look at me, can you? It's Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe! I'm too depressed to talk.<br> I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.<br> What about making that beach trip an annual thing? What happened out there? What? We took a walk.<br> Nothing happened.<br> I came back with nothing all over me.<br> What happened? Joey? All right.<br> We swore we'd never tell.<br> They'll never understand.<br> We have to get it out.<br> It's eating me alive! -Monica got stung by a jellyfish.<br> -All right! I got stung.<br> Stung bad.<br> I couldn't stand.<br> I couldn't walk.<br> We were two miles from the house.<br> We were scared and alone.<br> We didn't think we could make it.<br> I was in too much pain.<br> And I was tired from digging.<br> Then Joey remembered something.<br> I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.<br> Wait, I saw that.<br> On the Discovery Channel.<br> About jellyfish and how if you You peed on yourself? You can't say that! You don't know! I thought I would pass out.<br> I tried, but I couldn't bend that way.<br> That's right.<br> I stepped up.<br> She's my friend and she needed help.<br> If I had to, I'd pee on any of you.<br> Only I couldn't.<br> I got the stage fright.<br> I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure.<br> So I turned to Chandler.<br> Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now.<br> Do it.<br> Do it now!" Sometimes, late at night, I can still hear the screaming.<br> Because I do it through my wall to freak you out.<br> Maybe there's somebody you guys could talk to.<br> Oh, who? It's not like they have a group for people like us.<br> Yeah, no, there's this guy Owen, he's the best.<br> Might have his card.<br> And fuchsia and mauve Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom I invite all of you to count the colors in your bedroom.<br> Except for you.<br> You go away.<br> I'll go in a second.<br> I just want to tell you there wasn't a day I didn't regret giving you up.<br> Okay, bye.<br> I'm not done.<br> The reason I never looked you up was because I was afraid you'd react just like the way you're reacting now.<br> Can't we just start from here? Please? No.<br> Sorry.<br> One last thing.<br> You came looking for family.<br> I'm family.<br> I'm it.<br> Now I'm done.<br> It's not like we're losing anything.<br> I guess you're right.<br> It's not like we know each other or have anything in common.<br> I don't know.<br> It's not like we don't have anything in common.<br> I mean, I like pizza.<br> I like pizza! Wait, I like the Beatles.<br> Oh, my God! So do l.<br> Puppies.<br> Cute or ugly? So cute! You see? But I'm still mad at you.<br> I know.<br> I'm mad at me too.<br> Do you want to get something to eat? I'm kind of hungry.<br> Hey! Me too! Uncanny.<br> It looks like rain and I don't have my umbrella.<br> Me neither.<br> I really hate that.<br> Stop it.<br> Now you're just doing it to freak me out.<br> I missed you.<br> I missed you too.<br> I was so nervous about that letter.<br> But the way you owned up to everything it just showed me how much you've grown.<br> I suppose.<br> You have, Ross.<br> You should give yourself credit.<br> My mom never thought this would work out.<br> She said, "Once a cheater, always a cheater.<br>" I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.<br> But if time was what you needed to gain a little perspective.<br> We were on a break! -Coffeehouse? -You bet.<br> It took two people to break up this relationship.<br> You and that girl, which yesterday you took full responsibility for.<br> I didn't know what I took responsibility for.<br> I didn't finish the letter.<br> I fell asleep.<br> You fell asleep? It was 5:30 in the morning.<br> And you had rambled on for 18 pages.<br> Front and back! By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means "you are.<br>" Y-O-U-R means "your.<br>" I can't believe I thought of getting back with you! We are so over.<br> Fine by me! Those spelling tips will be handy Saturday nights at home playing Scrabble with Monica.<br> Sorry! All that sleep you'll miss wishing you were with me! Don't worry about me falling asleep.<br> I still have your letter! Just so you know, it's not that common.<br> It doesn't happen to every guy.<br> And it is a big deal! I knew it! Gin.<br> We were playing gin? If we were a couple, we could play naked.<br> -Would you stop? -Okay.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> I think you're great.<br> I think you're sweet and smart and I love you.<br> But you'll always be the guy who peed on me.<br>   <br>
