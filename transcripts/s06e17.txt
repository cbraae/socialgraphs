                    			Remember when I had a monkey? What was I thinking? Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong? You know what's more generous? -You know what's even more generous? -I see where you're going.<br> What's up with the greed? I'm sorry.<br> I have to get new headshots made, and they're really expensive.<br> I'm down to, like, three.<br> Actually, two, because one of them I blackened some teeth.<br> Why'd I do that? Isn't there something you can do to earn extra money? Can't you pick up an extra shift here? Or, you know, I used to beg for money.<br> It helps if you've got a little of this going on.<br> Wow! I still have it.<br> Don't you have an audition today? Maybe you'll get that job.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I used to get medical experiments done on me.<br> Finally, an explanation.<br> I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff.<br> Let's see.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Well, I don't want to donate sperm again.<br> I really prefer doing that at the home office.<br> Maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something, huh? -Joey? -Yeah.<br> What did I tell you about talking while working? Do it? That guy's been waiting 1 0 minutes.<br> He's complained about you three times.<br> Now, where was l? The One With Unagi Gelula/SDI What are you up to? We went to a self-defense class today.<br> Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you.<br> Takes it out of you? Now we can kick anybody's ass.<br> After one class? I don't think so.<br> You want to see me self-defend myself? Pretend you're a predator.<br> Go on, I dare you! Of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.<br> That's not enough.<br> Look, I studied karate for a long time.<br> And there's a concept you should be familiar with.<br> It's what the Japanese call unagi.<br> Isn't that a kind of sushi? No, it's a concept.<br> Yeah, it is.<br> It's freshwater eel.<br> Maybe it means that too.<br> I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now.<br> Fine, get attacked.<br> I don't even care.<br> Come on, Ross, we're sorry.<br> Please tell us what it is.<br> Unagi is a state of total awareness.<br> Only by achieving true unagi .<br> .<br> .<br>can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you.<br> In case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or your kettle of fish? It's one thing being prepared for an attack against each other.<br> Whole other story being prepared for an, I don't know-- A surprise! You knew that was coming.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but that doesn't mean you have unagi.<br> If we made reservations, we could have unagi in a half-hour.<br> -Is Monica here? -No.<br> I need help.<br> I don't know what to get for Valentine's Day.<br> Valentine's Day was two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar.<br> She was working, so we're celebrating tonight.<br> Why don't you book a day for both of you at those romantic spas? That's actually a good idea.<br> And, of course, crotchless panties.<br> Appealing as that sounds to her boyfriend.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and her brother.<br> We promised to make each other gifts this year.<br> -I love that.<br> -You guys! You can't make crotchless panties? You take scissors and cut-- Okay, okay, okay.<br> Making things sounds so much fun.<br> I thought so, until I papier-mÃ¢chÃ©d one of my eyes shut.<br> I love papier-mÃ¢chÃ©! What did you make? I made a flar-lar-lar.<br> -What is that? -Nothing! So, what'll you do? Have you made anything I can take credit for? I have, I have! I started making little sock bunnies! Oh, for crying out loud! Wait a minute.<br> That is my sock! Now it's your little bunny friend.<br> Okay.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> This actually is a flar-lar-lar.<br> Can I ask about the Valentine's Day gifts? -Yeah.<br> -Do we have to make the entire thing? Yes.<br> Did you forget to make yours? Of course not.<br> I just have to go to the place where I made it and pick it up.<br> I can't wait.<br> It'll be the best Valentine's Day ever! I can't believe it! Make the presents! -What? -Just so excited to make the presents! Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.<br> With all due respect, I'd like to donate some fluids.<br> We're at the end of a research cycle and not looking for applicants now.<br> That's too bad.<br> I've been saving up.<br> You sure there's no studies I can participate in? -Here's a schedule of what's coming up.<br> -Thanks.<br> This one starts now.<br> Only identical twins are eligible.<br> It's a twin study.<br> But it's $2000! Sorry.<br> And this? "Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani on Attractive Nurse Receptionists.<br> " Results are back on that one.<br> They're not good.<br> -That was good.<br> -Yeah.<br> Danger! Danger! What the hell was that? A lesson in the importance of unagi.<br> You're a freak! Perhaps.<br> Now I'm curious.<br> At what point during those girlish screams would you have kicked my ass? All right, so we weren't prepared! I'm sorry I took drastic measures to make my point.<br> I just want you to be safe.<br> Danger! Ah-ha! Unagi! I wish I had a twin.<br> Where could I find someone  who looks exactly like me? Chandler.<br> I sensed it was you.<br> What? Unagi.<br> I'm always aware.<br> Are you aware that unagi is an eel? -What's up? -What should I make for Monica? Why don't you make her one of your little jokes? I'm going crazy.<br> Do you have anything homemade? You know what? She'd love this.<br> It's a replica of Apollo 8.<br> I made it in the sixth grade.<br> I could use that.<br> I could say, "Your love sends me to the moon.<br> " Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.<br> You can write, "Your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.<br> " I can't give this to her.<br> -Why not? -It says "Captain Ross" on the side.<br> And it says, "I hate Monica" on the bottom.<br> Danger! Salmon skin roll.<br> "Yes, honey, I made it myself.<br> " I can't do it.<br> I can't do it.<br> A mixed tape! A mixed tape! Hi! Ready to exchange gifts? -Sure.<br> You go first.<br> -Okay, come here.<br> Okay, it's not wrapped because I just finished it.<br> But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.<br> What a great gift! Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it? We'll have to listen and see.<br> Oh, I love it! Thank you so much.<br> You ready to open yours? It's a sock bunny.<br> Remember how I call you bunny? Not really.<br> I did one time.<br> And I want to start doing it more.<br> -That's what this is about.<br> -I see.<br> Phoebe makes sock bunnies.<br> No, she doesn't.<br> What she makes, they're sock rabbits.<br> They're completely different.<br> Okay, okay.<br> I didn't make it! I forgot about tonight and that we're supposed to make the presents.<br> It's okay.<br> No, it's not okay.<br> You're so incredible.<br> You went through all this time and effort to make this tape.<br> I'll make this up to you.<br> I will.<br> I am going to cook you anything you want in here.<br> And I'm going to do anything you want in there.<br> Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape.<br> You are way too young to have seen that.<br> Your birthday's in a month and a half.<br> What if I forget to get you a present for that too? You are totally and completely We've got to wash that.<br> Remember that jacket you loved that was too expensive? You have done enough.<br> I'll wake up early and get it.<br> No-- Get it in black, not brown.<br> Your cake is ready.<br> It's like that old saying, "Have sex, eat some cake.<br> " Hey, Mon.<br> Hey, Chan.<br> Just getting a soda.<br> Who the hell are you? I'm Joey.<br> "How are you doing?" No! No! No! No! No! How "you" doing? How "you" doing? Damn it, Carl! Go wait in the hall.<br> I've got to apologize on behalf of Carl.<br> Who the hell is Carl? Did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my twin for a medical research project.<br> Sometimes the good ideas are right in front of you.<br> It sounds crazy, but it might work.<br> The only problem is Carl's acting.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> The only problem? He's the reason I didn't get that big commercial two years ago.<br> We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed up.<br> Can I get a piece of that cake? Pizza! We like pizza! Get out! -Pat Sajak? -Yep.<br> -Alex Trebek? -Of course.<br> -Chuck Woolery? -Definitely.<br> You will not find a single game show host whose ass I cannot kick.<br> -Say it! -Say we are unagi! It's not something you are, it's something you have.<br> Say it! I could easily get out of this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but there's a chance you could get very, very hurt! Carl, we're next.<br> Now remember, what is this not gonna be? -Another Minute Maid fiasco.<br> -That's right.<br> And what are you not gonna do? -I'm not gonna talk because-- -Damn it, Carl!
