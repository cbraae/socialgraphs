                    			I can't believe we've never done this.<br> It's so good! It's so good for Monica.<br> Time's up! My turn.<br> -That was half an hour? -It's your timer.<br> I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages.<br> All right, then massage me up right nice! It's so good, isn't it? I don't know what I did to deserve it.<br> Now stop trying to add more time to your massage.<br> Say goodbye to sore muscles! Goodbye, muscles! The One with Joey's Bag She gives the worst massages ever! It was like she was torturing me for information.<br> I wanted to give it up.<br> I just didn't know what it was! If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.<br> For the first time, I'm in a real relationship.<br> I won't screw that up by telling the truth.<br> Dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat.<br> Sorry.<br> And the bunny got away.<br> This would be the place where you explain the hat.<br> This is called a top hat.<br> And why are you wearing this? Is it "top hat"? There's this play and I'm up for the part of this cool, suave, international guy.<br> A clotheshorse.<br> So I figure everyone at the audition will wear ultra-hip, high-fashion stuff.<br> And you'll make them disappear? Like you could find something this sophisticated.<br> Done! If you want to look good, come to the store.<br> I'll help you.<br> -Thanks! -Sure.<br> Please, take those off! Hey, Phoebe.<br> How's it going? Only okay because I just got back from the hospital.<br> Are you all right? I'm fine, but my grandma sort of died.<br> Phoebe, sorry.<br> It's okay.<br> She had a really incredible life.<br> It's not like I won't see her again.<br> She'll visit.<br> Maybe she's with us right now.<br> Right.<br> She's on a new spiritual plain and she'll come to the coffeehouse.<br> I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside! Phoebe' grandmother just died.<br> Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.<br> Actually, it's kind of cool.<br> Because it's like you know, one life ends and another begins.<br> Not the way they're doing it.<br> What happened? How did she die? We were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and never came back up again.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> The last thing she said was: "You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt, and we'll meet at the checkout counter.<br>" You know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.<br> Since you're returning all this stuff you'll have to wear underwear.<br> All right.<br> You'd better show me that too.<br> It's missing something.<br> Really? A purse? It's not a purse.<br> It's a shoulder bag.<br> It looks like a woman's purse.<br> Trust me, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog.<br> See, look.<br> Men carrying the bag.<br> See, look.<br> Women carrying the bag.<br> But it is odd how a woman's purse looks so good on me, a man.<br> Exactly.<br> Unisex! Maybe you need sex.<br> I had sex a couple days ago.<br> No, Joey.<br> U-N-I sex.<br> I ain't gonna say no to that! -Who is it? -It's Phoebe.<br> Oh, great! Oh, you.<br> What's up? Well, I sort of have some bad news.<br> Can I come in? No, thanks.<br> Grandma died today.<br> Didn't she die like five years ago? No, she just died today.<br> We're having a memorial service tomorrow.<br> Okay, I know I went to that already.<br> No, you didn't! Then who's been dead? Lots of people! Look, are you coming or not? I thought she was dead, so I've made my peace.<br> Plus I'm going to a concert.<br> I'd invite you, but I only have two tickets left.<br> -Fine.<br> Okay, enjoy your concert.<br> -Thanks.<br> Enjoy your funeral! You look just like your son, Mrs.<br> Tribbiani.<br> What? Are you referring to my man's bag? I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too.<br> It's got compartments for your wallet, keys, address book.<br> Your makeup.<br> What are you doing? The audition's tomorrow.<br> Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.<br> You get mustard on that bag, you can't return it.<br> Why would I return this? I love this bag! -All right, then you owe me $350.<br> -Fine.<br> Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card? Relax, I'll pay you with the money from the job I'll get.<br> Thanks to you.<br> What's the part? Auntie Mame? Don't listen to them.<br> I think it's sexy.<br> You-and-I sexy? Hello, Mrs.<br> Pinilla.<br> Thank you for coming.<br> Here's your 3-D glasses.<br> Reverend Pong will say when to put them on.<br> Hi, sweetie.<br> -How are you holding up? -Fine.<br> Hey, Phoebe.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> You know what? My grandma had the exact same bag! I brought you flowers.<br> Oh, thanks! Pulling flowers out makes the bag look masculine.<br> Excuse me, is this the memorial? Welcome.<br> Here's your 3-D glasses.<br> All right.<br> So how did you know Frances? Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.<br> But I was pretty tight with her and her daughter.<br> What's your name? Frank Buffay.<br> You know what? Strike that.<br> My name, actually, is Joe.<br> Joe Hill.<br> You're Frank Buf No! Joe Hill.<br> You just said I got to go.<br> Thank you so much for coming.<br> Oh, my God! What happened? That was my dad.<br> Check it out! It's like it's coming right at me.<br> -Did you catch him? -What did he say? He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda.<br>" I couldn't give him my real name.<br> Why not? You saw the way he ran.<br> You think he'd talk to the daughter he abandoned? What did you say to him? I said I was the executor of the will and I needed to talk to him.<br> I'm going to meet him at the coffeehouse.<br> Could everyone take their seats? I just can't think about that now.<br> I want to say goodbye to my grandma.<br> Let's go say goodbye.<br> I'm off to my audition.<br> How do I look? Great! That bag will get you that part.<br> And a date with a man.<br> You know what? Make fun all you want.<br> This is a great bag.<br> And it's as handy as it is becoming.<br> Just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong.<br> You guys have to get used to the fact that Joey comes with a bag! I've got to meet my dad.<br> Will you tell him who you are? Not at first.<br> I don't want to freak him out.<br> But aren't you pissed at him? This guy abandoned you.<br> If it were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger.<br> I'd walk in there, I'd be like, "Yo, Dad! You and me, outside.<br> Right now!" I kind of scared myself.<br> Well, at least you scared someone.<br> You'd think I'd be angry.<br> You'd think I'd want to rip his tiny, little head off! Fortunately, I'm past it.<br> You do seem a little tense.<br> Here, let me help you.<br> Get off! Stop it! Why are you doing that to me? What are you talking about? As a masseuse and a human I'm begging you, never do that to anyone! I give good massages.<br> I gave them to Rachel before she got allergic.<br> And Chandler, he loves them! Watch.<br> He does not like it.<br> He's in pain! -No, he's not.<br> -Yes, he is! -What? -I'm sorry, but You've been lying to me? I can't believe that.<br> Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.<br> But the minute we start to lie to each other.<br> And by "we" I mean society.<br> Anytime you're ready.<br> Well, you must be new here.<br> Maybe we get a table, I buy you a drink.<br> Could you try it without the purse? Yeah, sure.<br> Well, you must be new here.<br> Maybe we sit Can I ask you something? Sure.<br> What? Well, first, it's not a purse.<br> Anytime.<br> If you think it's a woman's bag, it's not.<br> It's a man's bag.<br> Okay.<br> And go! Let me show you the catalog.<br> Look.<br> See? It's the latest thing.<br> Everyone's got one.<br> Men, women, children.<br> Do you sell these? No, these babies sell themselves.<br> Thank you.<br> That was great.<br> But I didn't read anything.<br> I think we've seen enough.<br> All right, I'll see you.<br> We got it.<br> We got it.<br> Is Rachel here? Listen, I just wanted to apologize about the whole massage thing.<br> I really like them.<br> Please, stop! We're supposed to be honest.<br> I wish you could tell me, "l don't like your massages.<br>" I don't like your massages.<br> See? It's no big deal.<br> But now you're crying! I'm not crying about that.<br> I'm crying about something at work.<br> My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.<br> You don't have to be best at everything.<br> Oh, my God! You don't know me at all! You give the worst massages in the world.<br> I'm crying here! Look, hear me out.<br> You give the best bad-massages.<br> If anybody was looking for the best bad-massage and they thought, "Who's the best?" They'd have to go to you.<br> So you're saying that if there was an award for the best bad-massage.<br> Who would get that? It would be you! You, Monica! And you'd get all the votes.<br> So they could call the award, "The Monica"? Absolutely.<br> I suck! Thank you for meeting me.<br> Thank you.<br> Come sit.<br> Sit.<br> Sit! Alrighty.<br> Before we get started, I need you to state for the record that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.<br> Yes, I am.<br> What did Frances leave me? That's why you wanted me to come.<br> Yes, she did.<br> She left you this lipstick.<br> It's used.<br> Cool! I have just a few questions to ask, so I'll get out my official forms.<br> So question one: You were married to Frances' daughter, Lilly.<br> Correct? Yes, I was.<br> Question two.<br> Did that marriage end: A: Happily? B: Medium? Or C: In the total abandonment of her and her two children? It really says that? Yeah, see? I guess then I would have to say C.<br> Total abandonment.<br> Reasons for abandonment: A: Top-secret government work.<br> B: Amnesia.<br> Or C: You're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man.<br> I don't want the lipstick that much.<br> Would you do me a favor? Would you give Lilly that, please? When you see Lilly, give her that note.<br> I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but I pictured her getting mad the way you did, and I chickened out.<br> I wrote her a note.<br> Give it to her, please? But you came to see Lilly? Yeah.<br> Why? Lilly's dead.<br> She what? She's dead.<br> Are you sure? If she isn't, cremating her was a big mistake.<br> I can't believe this.<br> I just can't believe How? Oh, my God.<br> How long ago? What about the girls? Well, Ursula is a waitress and she lives in Soho.<br> And Phoebe is on this couch.<br> Yep, lipstick and a daughter.<br> Big day for you! Phoebe, l.<br> It's just, I don't know what to say.<br> I just can't believe that you're my daughter.<br> You're so pretty.<br> Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.<br> Would it make you feel better if I said that I was very, very sorry I left? It doesn't matter what you say.<br> It won't make a difference.<br> So you can just go.<br> Well, you know, in my defense, I was a lousy father.<br> -That's your defense? -Yes, it is.<br> I burned the formula, and I put your diapers on backwards.<br> I made up a song to sing to you, but that made you cry even more.<br> You make up songs? Well, no, just that one.<br> But it was stupid.<br> Let's see, how did it go? Sleepy girl, sleepy girl Why won't you go to sleep? Sleepy girl, sleepy girl You're keeping me up I'm not very good at this.<br> Well, I am.<br> Not yet.<br> No.<br> How'd the audition go? Estelle said I didn't get it.<br> What? Why? Joey, you were so ready for it.<br> I thought so too but the casting people had problems with me.<br> What kind of problem? To tell you the truth they had a problem with the bag! You know what? It was a stupid play anyway.<br> It's time to give up the bag.<br> I don't want to give up the bag.<br> I don't have to give it up.<br> Do l, Rach? You think I should give up the bag! Joey, I'm sorry.<br> As terrific as I think you are with it I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.<br> I can't believe this! Wait, I'm not saying you shouldn't have a bag.<br> There are other bags that are maybe a little less controversial.<br> Yeah, they're called wallets.<br> You're right.<br> You're right.<br> This bag has become like a part of me.<br> It's likemy bag.<br> It had a place for everything.<br> -Oh, man.<br> -What? There's a whole series of pockets here I didn't even know about, Rach.<br> Look.<br> Ursula, I have the most amazing news.<br> I found our dad.<br> Phoebe.<br> Your sister.<br> And I found our dad.<br> John Glenn? John Glenn is not our dad.<br> No, I will not join you in the lawsuit against him.<br> It doesn't matter that he wasn't there while we were growing up.<br> He's not our father.<br> What do you mean that's for a jury to decide?   <br>
