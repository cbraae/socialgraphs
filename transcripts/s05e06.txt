                    			None of that.<br> Not while you're under my roof! Just because I know about you doesn't mean I like looking at it.<br> Aren't you supposed to be at an audition? I'm sorry I'm not a middle-aged black woman.<br> I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.<br> If I pretend to not know about you then you pretend there's nothing to know.<br> Sorry.<br> I can hear that! Rachel's at work.<br> I can still hear you! The One With the Yeti What's that? My mom sent me an heirloom that belonged to my grandmother.<br> Can you believe it? A year ago I had no family, and now I have heirlooms! The only heirloom I ever got was a feather boa.<br> Got if from my dad.<br> He got it from his dad.<br> How did I ever get born? Oh, God! Soft.<br> Is this mink? Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all? I have a fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.<br> Just Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.<br> I made that up.<br> You can't put up flyers in here.<br> How come? Everybody else does.<br> You can't.<br> What is that? I'm getting rid of some things.<br> This is all of your things.<br> Yes, it is.<br> It's good.<br> Emily thinks we should get all new stuff.<br> Stuff that's just ours.<br> Together.<br> Brand new.<br> So it's a get-rid-of-anything- Rachel-ever-touched sale.<br> Touched, used, sat on, slept on.<br> I'll take it all.<br> You're okay with that? If I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, it will be fine.<br> Isn't that a little extreme? After what I did, can you blame her? You got off easy.<br> When my friend's husband said another name in bed she cursed him and turned his thingy green.<br> I guess I'm lucky Emily is not magic.<br> Oh, she is.<br> We all are.<br> What is he doing? Emily thinks Ross' furniture has got Rachel cooties? Calm down, Joey.<br> Everything's getting all messed up! Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.<br> We won't stop seeing Rachel.<br> Hence, Ross stops seeing us.<br> I hate this.<br> Everything's changing.<br> We're losing Ross.<br> Joey said "hence.<br>" I'm not happy about this either, but if Ross says he's happy then we have to keep our feelings to ourselves.<br> Are you cool with that? But, you know, I'm an actor.<br> I'll act cool.<br> Probably be some of the hardest acting I've ever done.<br> Maybe I'll play it with a mustache.<br> Storage rooms give me the creeps.<br> Please hurry up, honey.<br> If you want little round waffles, wait till I find the iron.<br> I want the little round waffles.<br> Here it is! Right underneath the can of bug bomb.<br> Is the best place to put something that cooks food underneath poison? You know what? I'll have toast.<br> Fog him! Fog him! I don't know what to do about this coat.<br> I'll take it.<br> That might work.<br> What do you think? You're on in five, Ms.<br> Minnelli.<br> No, it's just a bit sudden.<br> It's great, okay? I am totally onboard.<br> I love you too.<br> All right, bye.<br> What's the matter? Nothing.<br> No, actually great news! I just spoke with Emily and looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.<br> Why? Her thought is, and I agree fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has a place to sublet.<br> It's got a view of the river and Columbia.<br> That's way uptown! That's three trains away which is great! I love to ride that rail.<br> You're okay with this? It's kind of far from work but I'll get so much done on the commute.<br> I've been given the gift of time.<br> That's so funny.<br> Last Christmas I got the gift of space.<br> We should get them together and make a continuum.<br> Now he's moving? Man, what is Emily doing to him? He's not even here! You guys! We were in the storage area, and we saw this creepy man.<br> It was this crazy-eyed, hairy beast-man.<br> It was like a Big Foot or a yeti or something.<br> He came at us, so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.<br> I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.<br> Like, dark hair, bushy beard? Yeah, you fogged Danny.<br> Please! We did not fog Danny.<br> Who's Danny? Danny just moved in.<br> He just got back from a four-month trek in the Andes.<br> Nice fella.<br> He's nice.<br> You know, you always stick up for the people we fog.<br> You might not remember us, but we're the girls that fogged you.<br> We're really sorry we fogged you.<br> Just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.<br> We thought you were like a yeti or something.<br> Sorry to bother you, but we can't accept your acceptance of our apology.<br> It doesn't really seem like you mean it.<br> That guy is so rude! Really! What is with that guy? You'd forgive me if I fogged you.<br> You did, a little bit.<br> Oh, my God, honey.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> -I totally forgive you.<br> -Really? You know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium? Crematorium Chris? Sure.<br> He said he would cremate my fur coat for free if I bring in the next person I know who dies.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God.<br> Look at these pelts! Don't get too attached.<br> She's having it cremated.<br> You're quirky, and I get a big kick out of it.<br> We all do.<br> But if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature.<br> Not nature.<br> Fashion! This is fashion? So to you, death is fashion? That's funny.<br> Here's Phoebe sporting cutting-edge hairy carcass from, you know, the steel traps of wintry Russia.<br> You really think this looks good? Because I do! I miss you too.<br> I can't wait to see you.<br> I love you.<br> Bye.<br> What is in here, rocks? No, it's my collection of fossil samples.<br> So, rocks.<br> I'll miss this apartment.<br> You know, Ben took his first steps right over there.<br> Remember when I ran into this and it knocked me out? I love this place.<br> To tell the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.<br> Are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this? If Emily gave me a choice You do have a choice! Why are you listening to her? Are you crazy? It's not right what Emily wants you to do.<br> She's totally Stop pinching me! You guys said to keep my mouth shut if Ross was happy, right? He just told me that he's not entirely happy.<br> What's going on? We all hate Emily! No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.<br> We just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.<br> We just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.<br> Yes, unreasonable.<br> Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you marries? You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.<br> It's compromise.<br> Do you always like it? No.<br> Do you do it? Yes.<br> Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky coffee at Central Perk.<br> It's real life, okay? It's what grownups do.<br> I think he's right.<br> You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.<br> -I feel so guilty about Ross.<br> -I know.<br> I kind of feel like it's my fault.<br> Kind of? You should have kept this to yourself.<br> I'm keeping so many things to myself, something was bound to slip out! I think it's very brave what you said.<br> I can't sit here anymore.<br> I have to walk places.<br> What's with the coat? How about the animal rights thing? I've been reading up, and for your information minks aren't very nice.<br> -So they deserve to be killed? -Well, they are real bad.<br> Okay, I admit it.<br> I love this coat, okay? It's the best thing I ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley.<br> Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.<br> So you like the short hair better? Yeti? Danny? I had to cut my hair to get rid of the fogger smell.<br> Listen, I'm so sorry.<br> I would have never fogged you if you hadn't looked so.<br> Absolutely.<br> Some people are just into appearances.<br> What? It's cool.<br> No, that is not cool.<br> You don't even know me.<br> You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalog.<br> From that, you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't.<br> You know, I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.<br> Do you? You know, if kids like to play with capri pants.<br> Stop saying that.<br> I hate that! I judged you.<br> I made a snap judgment.<br> But you did it too, and you're worse.<br> You're sticking to your judgment.<br> You can't even open your mind to see you might be wrong.<br> What does that say about you? That pizza place across the street any good? I'm hungry.<br> You want some pizza? You can keep yelling.<br> Stop saying that.<br> I hate that.<br> Are you still mad? Good! We have an "I'm Sorry" song.<br> You know what? I'm not in the mood.<br> Look, Ross.<br> I feel really bad.<br> You're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.<br> -We are so sorry.<br> -You're stepping on the song.<br> We were way out of line, all right? We totally support you.<br> Whatever you decide, whatever you do.<br> Now you're just taking lines out of the song.<br> This is hard enough, okay? I really need you guys right now.<br> Yes, exactly! And that's why.<br> Why don't you come over tonight, and I'll make your favorite dinner.<br> Thanks, you guys.<br> Are you wearing fur? Let's get some perspective, people.<br> It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat! You know, I think I kind of understand why I lost it today.<br> You do, huh? You see I'm an actor, right? So I got to keep my emotions right at the surface.<br> I got a lot of balls in the air, you know? It's tough.<br> Guys like me, you wander around, you're alone.<br> What are you talking about? I'm not sure.<br> Look at you! Where have you been? I went to have pizza.<br> With Danny.<br> -What happened? -That yeti is one smooth talker.<br> Yetis are smooth-talkers.<br> That's why you never see any pictures of them.<br> "Come here, baby.<br> Give me the camera.<br>" I hope you're not full.<br> Dinner's almost ready.<br> I think I'll probably just hang out in my room.<br> Why? Come on, you guys! If Emily knew I was having dinner with you, she'd flip out.<br> It's okay.<br> I really don't mind.<br> Wait, wait.<br> You know what? Just stay.<br> Please.<br> It would mean a lot for me if you stay.<br> Ross, I just Please, just have dinner with us! Settle down.<br> All right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You see, Rach, I'm an actor.<br> Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back.<br> We haven't seen him in so long.<br> Oh, God! I really missed that fat bastard.<br> This is so weird.<br> I realized this may be the last time we hang out together.<br> It's almost as if he knew.<br> I'll get it.<br> Hi, Emily.<br> You tracked him down.<br> Hold on.<br> Yeah, we're just having dinner.<br> Sure, hold on.<br> She wants to say hi.<br> Hi, Emily! Hello, everyone.<br> So who am I saying hello to? Well, I don't know about who's here but I can tell you who's not here, and that's Rachel! I should hope not.<br> Ross knows better than that by now.<br> You know what? Rachel is here.<br> She's there? Oh, yeah, there she is! She's here.<br> Take me off speakerphone.<br> How could you do this to me? I made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear.<br> I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay? -You can't keep away from her.<br> -That's ridiculous.<br> -Hello? Hello? -Who is this? It's Ross.<br> What are you doing? Sorry, dude, I had to make a call.<br> Joey.<br> Joey, they don't have two lines, they have two phones.<br> Gotcha.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Emily, listen.<br> I have never cheated on you.<br> I'm moving for you.<br> I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.<br> Please, get on the plane and come to New York, okay? You're the only one I want to be with.<br> I'll feel better when I'm there.<br> I can know where you are all the time.<br> You can't know where I am all the time.<br> This marriage will never work if you don't trust me.<br> You're right.<br> Can you trust me? I think it's going okay.<br> Looks like he's smiling.<br> How can you tell? You can only see his back.<br> You can totally tell! Here, look, watch me.<br> Smile.<br> Frown.<br> Smile.<br> Frown.<br> Smile.<br> I guess that's it.<br> Why? What happened? My marriage is over.<br> Look at you, you're shivering.<br> Here.<br> Honey, is there anything we can do? You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.<br> Stop tormenting me! This is mink, okay? They're mean, and they hate squirrels.<br> Most of these probably wanted to be coats.<br> Fine.<br> No, I get it.<br> Here.<br> You take it.<br> Are you happy now? I'm cold!   <br>
