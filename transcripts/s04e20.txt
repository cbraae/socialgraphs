                    			Are you kidding me? Joey? Did I wake you? The One with All the Wedding Dresses Gunther, could I get another cup of coffee? So what do you do when you're not working here? -You don't need to fill these silences.<br> -Okay, thanks.<br> That's your fourth cup of coffee.<br> Okay, do me.<br> I've had a certain number of juices.<br> I'm exhausted because Joey started snoring.<br> He's in a different room.<br> He's that loud? You should hear me.<br> It's nothing to be proud of.<br> Go to a sleep clinic.<br> I'm not going to any clinic.<br> I don't have a problem.<br> You have the problem.<br> You should go to a "Quit-being- a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.<br> -They don't have those.<br> -Yeah, they do.<br> Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you just had your first class.<br> I used to date a light sleeper.<br> Whenever I snored, he rolled me over Oh, yeah! He'd roll me over, and I'd stop snoring.<br> Next time you snore, I'm rolling you over! I gotta do what I gotta do.<br> You gotta do what you gotta do.<br> Hey, guys.<br> Oh, the Olympics! -Have you picked a date? -No.<br> Not yet.<br> I still cannot believe you're engaged.<br> Because it's so fast.<br> Not because you're a loser.<br> Thanks.<br> Has anyone seen Rach? She's upstairs not doing the dishes.<br> I won't do them this time.<br> Even if they sit there until.<br> I'll do them when I get home.<br> Emily found this wedding dress in London -Already? -But it didn't fit.<br> There's a store here with one left in her size.<br> But the groom can't see -I'll pick it up for you.<br> -Thanks.<br> She's got you running errands, picking up wedding dresses.<br> Wah-pah! What's wah-pah? You know.<br> Whipped.<br> Wah-pah! That's not whipped.<br> Whipped is.<br> That's what I did.<br> You can't do anything! Hey, Mon.<br> I was just doing these dishes.<br> Do you have a minute? I was just about to take a break anyway.<br> So listen I know we haven't had a chance to talk since Emily and l decided to get married.<br> And I was just wondering how you were.<br> If you were getting married, I would feel kind of.<br> You know? It definitely took me by surprise.<br> But, you know I'm okay.<br> I just wanted to check.<br> That's sweet.<br> Thank you.<br> You're great.<br> And I know someday this will happen for you too.<br> You just hang in there.<br> "Hang in there"? No, I didn't mean.<br> You haven't heard of a serious relationship called "me and Joshua"? I thought you had just been on four dates.<br> I didn't realize that had become anything.<br> Oh no, it has become.<br> Oh no, those were four great dates.<br> I mean, and the connection! Emotionally, mentally.<br> You know? Physically.<br> -That's incredible.<br> -I know, isn't it? I'm right there with Joshua.<br> You are right there with Emily.<br> And it's kind of like it's a tie.<br> I gotta get back to my dishes.<br> I gotta get to work.<br> You know what would make me happy? You know, what's that? If the four of us could all, you know, hang out together.<br> Emily's coming into town this weekend.<br> Why don't we all have dinner Sunday night? That would be great! All right.<br> It's a date! "Hang in there.<br>" You hang in there.<br> -Did you say something? -No, just singing.<br> Oh, my God! Look at this one! It's so beautiful.<br> About half of these will end up getting divorced.<br> May I help you ladies? I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.<br> What's the name? -Emily Waltham.<br> -Yes, I have it right here.<br> Would you like to try it on, Miss Waltham? You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.<br> I am, aren't l? Miss Waltham? We're closing.<br> All right.<br> And could I get my ring back? All right, buddy.<br> Time to roll over.<br> You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic! And a pajama store! Does she use the cups? Yes, I believe she does.<br> Does she use the plates? Yes, I believe she does! Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Thank you for coming.<br> -Just a second.<br> -No, no! Let me in! Can you hold on a minute? No! You have to let me in right now! Are you alone? All right.<br> This sucks.<br> I have to stay up all night before I go to the stupid clinic.<br> I'm so tired.<br> It's six o'clock.<br> I hear you and Joshua are going out with Ross and Emily.<br> I think that's really cool.<br> I think you're handling that really well.<br> "Handling it"? There's nothing to handle.<br> Maybe I'd have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.<br> They're not going to get married anyway.<br> They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous! They'll be engaged for like what? A year? One of them will realize what they've done and call it off.<br> You'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.<br> You know, I don't dance at weddings.<br> Why not? Weddings are a great place to meet women.<br> When I dance, I look like this.<br> Hey, man.<br> What are you doing four weeks from today? -Nothing.<br> -Nothing.<br> I am free.<br> Because we're getting married in a month.<br> -What? -Yes.<br> In a month? -You mean 30 days? -Yeah.<br> From now? That's great! She always wanted to get married where her parents did but it's getting torn down.<br> I know it's crazy, but everything's been so crazy and it just feels right.<br> Hey, that's the day after I start menstruating! This isn't mine.<br> -Hey, Rachel.<br> -Hi.<br> What's up? Your voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.<br> Nothing.<br> I just wanted to see you.<br> See you and hug you.<br> See you.<br> Great! Sit.<br> You okay? I'm more than okay.<br> I am really, really happy.<br> Want to know why? Do l? Because I am really happy about us.<br> I think we are so on the right track.<br> I think we are working.<br> I think we are clicking.<br> -You know? -Yeah, sure, sure.<br> We're clicking.<br> If there was just one little area where I think we need to work on, I would think it's that we're just not crazy enough.<br> I got to say, I'm not too sure I agree with that.<br> You know, yeah, you're right.<br> We have our fun.<br> Yeah? I mean, like crazy! You know? Are you gonna put on that cheerleader outfit again? No.<br> You wish.<br> All right.<br> This is going to sound, you know, a little hasty.<br> But just go with me.<br> What if we got married? -What? -Oh, I know.<br> It's so totally like "Whoa, can we do this?" You know? But it just feels right.<br> Don't you think it does? I mean, it just feels right.<br> Don't you? Rachel you're a real special lady.<br> But my divorce isn't final yet and we've been on four dates.<br> So I'm thinking: No but thanks.<br> You idiot! -Your name, please? -Joey Tribbiani.<br> Did you stay up all night in preparation for your study? Sir? Yes, he did.<br> All right.<br> We'll call you in a few minutes.<br> Check out that girl.<br> She's really hot.<br> Yeah, she is.<br> How you doing? You looking good.<br> -What? -You're coming on to the entire room.<br> -I'm Chandler.<br> -I'm Marjorie.<br> -Do you mind if I sit? -Please.<br> So what are you in for? I talk in my sleep.<br> What a coincidence! I listen in my sleep.<br> So why don't you give me your number? Are you ready? I got it! Mine! -Congratulations! -Thank you! My turn, my turn! Okay, ready? That was a terrible throw! I won't throw it right to you.<br> That's not real.<br> Look at me.<br> My big concern is what's real? Oh, my God! We're really sad, aren't we? Yeah, I think we are.<br> This isn't even my dress.<br> At least you didn't rent yours from a store called "It's Not Too Late.<br>" -I'm changing out of this.<br> -Me, too.<br> In half an hour? Me, too.<br> All right, now throw it straight this time.<br> I'm getting married! I hate my regular clothes now.<br> I look down and I know this won't be the most special day of my life.<br> I mean, it was kind of fun for a while but didn't you feel kind of silly? I guess.<br> Oh, my God! You're such a cheater! Hello, little ones.<br> -So, is Joey going to stop snoring? -Yep! And a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.<br> Joey wanted to ask her out, but, you know, she picked me.<br> How'd that happen? Because I'm cooler.<br> No, seriously.<br> She's the kind of girl.<br> Joey was unconscious.<br> Hey, you guys! What's happening? Oh, my God! What is that? They gave it to me at the sleep clinic and it's going to help me not to snore.<br> Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? You don't have to wear it unless you are.<br> I know I don't have to.<br> It tastes good.<br> Plus, you look cool.<br> Hope I didn't stretch Emily's dress.<br> Your butt's not that much bigger than her's.<br> I just called Joshua.<br> How'd it go? I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who's dying to get married.<br> And I'm going through a hard time.<br> What'd he say? His answering machine was very understanding.<br> I feel blue.<br> I bet you anything he'll call you again.<br> Yeah, maybe.<br> But, you know, I don't think I even care.<br> I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.<br> I know I said I'm totally okay with Ross getting married.<br> But as it turns out I don't think I'm handling it all that well.<br> Yeah, maybe.<br> And I'm just trying to figure out why.<br> Any luck? You know how Ross and I have always been on-again, off-again? I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road we would be on again.<br> Again.<br> You know what? I think we all did.<br> I got us reservations for Sunday night.<br> How about Ernie's at 9:00? Well, you'd better make it for three.<br> I don't know if we're going to be hungry at three.<br> Three people.<br> Joshua's not going to be there.<br> What happened? Well, I think he broke up with me.<br> No.<br> Why? Apparently, he scares easy.<br> Rachel, I'm sorry.<br> It's okay.<br> Sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.<br> Come here.<br> Don't you have to go pick up Emily? -Are you okay? -Yeah.<br> I got my girls.<br> Hey, you know what might cheer you up? What? I got to tell you this really does put me in a better mood.<br> I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.<br> Maybe someday there will be.<br> Chandler's coming by to borrow candles for his big date.<br> Rachel, don't get it! He'll see us! The groom cannot see the bride.<br> I'm not going to marry Chandler.<br> Not after this! Okay guys, just relax.<br> I do! I got to go.<br> Yeah, well, that ought to do it.<br> Food's here.<br> Fair enough.<br> Fifteen-minute warning.<br> Late.<br> Dude, I am trying to sleep!   <br>
