Oh, come on, people.<br> If I don't know who makes the most how do I know who I like the most? Hi, Joey.<br> It pays nothing.<br> It's an internship.<br> We have interns at "Days of Our Lives".<br> Right.<br> So it'll be the same, except less sex with you.<br> What do you think they'll have you do there? It's a training program, but they hire the people they like.<br> - That's great! - There's gonna be some grunt work which will stink.<br> A grown man getting people coffee is humiliating.<br> Humiliating and noble.<br> Thank you.<br> You know, if I didn't already have a job I would've been good in advertising.<br> Ross, you did not come up with: "Got Milk?" Yes, I did! I did! I should've written it down.<br> The One With the Mugging mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 Where's Chandler?

Oh, my God, that is great! It's for a play on Broadway.<br> And in a real theater.<br> Not that little one underneath the deli like last time.<br> - Is it a good play? - It must be.<br> I read it and didn't understand a single word! - Leonard Hayes is starring in it.<br> - Yeah, and directing.<br> He was so good in that movie of "Macbeth".<br> - You saw that? - No, but I saw the previews.<br> They played it right before "Jackass".<br> - He's done some amazing work.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I loved him in those phone commercials.<br> When the monkey hits him in the face with the giant rubber phone Maybe the monkey will be at the audition.<br> Don't make me more nervous than I already am! - Good morning.<br> - Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir? Oh, no, no.<br> I'm an intern, just like you guys.<br> Except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that I can rent a car.<br> Seriously, you're an intern? I'm heading in a new career direction and you gotta start at the bottom.<br> Dude.<br> I know I'm a little older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.<br> The comedian.<br> USO.<br> It's U.<br>S.<br>A.<br>, sir.<br> This is Joey Tribbiani.<br> Joey, these are the producers.<br> And as you probably already know, this is Leonard Hayes.<br> It is so amazing to meet you.<br> I am such a big fan of your work.<br> I've been blessed with a lot of great roles.<br> Tell me about it, huh? "Unlimited nights and weekends!" Are you making fun of me? Because I am not a sellout.<br> I didn't do it for money.<br> I believe in those phones! I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.<br> No, I wasn't making fun of you.<br> I think you were great in those commercials.<br> - Really? - Yeah.<br> Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.<br> Are you kidding? When they shoot you out of that cannon "Hang up that phone!" - One take.<br> - Wow.<br> - So shall we read? - Oh, yeah, sure.<br> Top of Act 2.<br> This is my entrance.<br> You got it? What the hell are you still doing here? - I think you know.<br> - Bastard! I am what you made me.<br> You know what? I could go right now.<br> - Go! Go! - I can't.<br> Oh, I want to, Long Pause but I can't.<br> So sorry.<br> You're not supposed to say "long pause.<br>" Oh! Oh, I thought that was your character's name.<br> You know? I thought you were, like, an Indian or something, you know, with the No.<br> Thank you so much for coming in.<br> We appreciate it.<br> Thank you.<br> You don't want me to do it again? - I could do an accent.<br> - No.<br> You know, Southern.<br> "I could go right now, mon!" Huh? My God in heaven.<br> Joey, hang on.<br> Leonard, can we talk to you for a moment? Yes? You've got to be kidding.<br> He can't act.<br> I don't care if you think he's hot.<br> If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.<br> This is a play.<br> If you insist on this I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone connection so clear, he's gonna think I'm next door! Hi, thank you so much for whispering for my benefit.<br> Tell me what I did wrong.<br> I'd love to work on it and try it again for you.<br> And also, how you doing? Give me another chance.<br> I really want to get better.<br> Please? If you want to come back today here are my notes.<br> Ready? - Yeah.<br> - You're in your head.<br> Thinking too much.<br> - I really doubt that.<br> No, no.<br> It's that you're not connected with anything in your body.<br> There's no urgency.<br> The scene is a struggle.<br> It's a race.<br> Also, what you did was horizontal.<br> Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.<br> And don't learn the words.<br> Let the words learn you.<br> Couldn't I just sleep with the producer? Hey, do you want to go to dinner tonight? I can't.<br> I've got a date with that waitress, Katie.<br> I know we've only gone out, like, twice, but I don't know I have a good feeling about her.<br> - Oh, I hear divorce bells.<br> Give me your wallets, and there won't be a problem.<br> - What? - I have a gun.<br> Okay, relax, Phoebe.<br> Just stay calm.<br> Oh, my God, I can't find my wallet! - All right, lady, now give me your purse.<br> - No.<br> What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay! - Lowell, is that you? - Phoebe? - Oh, my God! - Unbelievable! Oh, my God! I'm sorry.<br> Ross, this is my old friend, Lowell, from the streets! - Lowell, Ross.<br> - Ross, nice to meet you.<br> Yeah, a real pleasure.<br> It's been so long! Oh, so long.<br> - I can't believe you're still doing this.<br> - I know.<br> But I quit smoking.<br> Good for you.<br> You look like you're doing well.<br> I guess your mugging days are behind you.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Phoebe, you used to mug people? Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.<br> - How'd the audition go? - They want to see me again, but Leonard Hayes did not like me.<br> - What happened? - He said I wasn't urgent enough.<br> Everything I did was horizontal, and I should be more vertical.<br> - He said that I should think less.<br> - Well, so far so good.<br> Honey, I'm old! What's wrong? I am so much older than these other interns.<br> I can't compete with them.<br> So you're a little older.<br> Look at the positive.<br> You have all this life experience.<br> Yes, but I don't think life experience is gonna help me with these.<br> Wow! It's like they're on fire! - What are they? - Prototype sneakers.<br> I need ideas on how to sell them.<br> Which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever wear these.<br> I'll give you $500 for them.<br> - What am I supposed to do? - Come on, sneakers are easy.<br> - You wear them all the time.<br> - They're not called sneakers anymore.<br> They're called "kicks" or "skids.<br>" I think I heard somebody say "slorps.<br>" They've got wheels that pop out from the bottom so you can roll around because apparently walking is too much exercise.<br> "Kids! Kids! Roll your way to childhood obesity!" Would you help me try to sell these? Okay.<br> Have you considered using a girl with huge knockers? That's not what they're looking for.<br> Hey, that would work on me.<br> Why do you think I buy Mrs.<br> Butterworth's? You'll never guess what just happened.<br> - Phoebe and I got mugged! - Are you okay? Yeah.<br> Phoebe knew the mugger.<br> How do you know a mugger? I'm sorry, I have friends outside the six of us.<br> Know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people.<br> Seriously? Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff - That is awful.<br> - I wasn't rich like you guys, okay? I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.<br> I had a hard life.<br> My mother was killed by a drug dealer.<br> - Your mother killed herself.<br> - She was a drug dealer.<br> It was a good thing she knew him.<br> I was about to do some serious damage.<br> Okay.<br> This must have brought back some bad memories for you, Ross.<br> - Why? - Ross was mugged as a kid.<br> - You were? - Yeah.<br> And it was pretty traumatic.<br> It was outside St.<br> Mark's Comics.<br> I was minding my business, seeing what kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.<br> Wonder Woman.<br> Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone when out of nowhere, this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: - "Give me your money, punk!" - Oh, my God.<br> I know.<br> And the worst part was, they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I did for my own comic book, "Science Boy".<br> Oh, yeah! What was his super power again? A super-human thirst for knowledge.<br> I better get to class.<br> Are there any more of your friends I should look out for? No.<br> Actually, you might want to stay away from Jane Street.<br> That's where Stabby Joe works.<br> - I think we have a problem here.<br> - What? Back in my mugging days, I worked St.<br> Mark's Comics.<br> - Yeah? - A pipe was my weapon of choice and preteen, comic-book nerds were my meat.<br> So? There was one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said: - "Geology rocks!" - "Geology rocks!" - Oh, my God! - I know! I mugged Ross! - You're late.<br> - I know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> But can I just run to the bathroom? - No.<br> Leonard doesn't wait.<br> - But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo! Joey, here we go! Let's go.<br> Very quickly.<br> - I really need - We must go now, quickly.<br> - Yeah.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Ready? - What the hell are you still doing here? - I think you know! - Oh, you sick bastard! - I am what you made me! Know what? - What? - I could go right now.<br> - Then go.<br> Go! - Oh, I can't.<br> I want to, but I can't! Cut.<br> That was good! - Very good.<br> You did everything I asked.<br> - I did? Yes.<br> Plus which, you've got this, I don't know, this squirmy quality you bring to the character I couldn't have imagined.<br> Here's what we're gonna do: Come back tomorrow for the final callbacks.<br> Do all of this, what you got going now.<br> But you know what? More.<br> More.<br> Can you do that? Sure.<br> I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go! Look at that! Still in character.<br> I like him.<br> I plant seeds.<br> I can't explain it.<br> I don't know.<br> - Hey.<br> What are you doing? - Putting on the sneakers to get in the young mindset, see if it sparks anything.<br> - Oh, anything yet? - Yes, how's this? "They're so uncomfortable, it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.<br>" You're probably wondering what I'm doing.<br> No, that seems about right.<br> Yesterday at my audition, I had to pee.<br> Apparently, that makes me a good actor.<br> I got a callback, so I'm drinking everything.<br> Oh, by the way that eggnog in our fridge was great! - Joey, that was formula.<br> - We gotta get more of that.<br> These aren't half bad.<br> You should suggest these to Ralph Lauren.<br> Okay, first of all, that's stupid.<br> Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.<br> All right.<br> I feel younger already.<br> Yeah, I think I broke my hip.<br> - Hey, you! - Hey.<br> Hey.<br> How was class? No one asks me that.<br> What's wrong? - Nothing.<br> I really want to know.<br> - Oh.<br> Well, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene All right, nothing is worth this.<br> I have a confession to make.<br> Okay, you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid? What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl.<br> It was this huge dude.<br> You don't have to lie anymore.<br> I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.<br> - No, it wasn't.<br> - Yes, it was.<br> You don't think I would have defended myself against a 14-year-old? - "Give me your money, punk!" - Oh, my God, it was you! I can't believe it.<br> You mugged me? Yeah.<br> And I'm so, so sorry, Ross.<br> I'm sorry.<br> But, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.<br> I mean, well, it's just that I've always felt kind of like an outsider.<br> You know, the rest of you have connections that go way back and, you know, now you and I have a great one.<br> It's not the best! I know.<br> Please forgive me.<br> I don't know what to say.<br> There's nothing you can say! That was the most humiliating thing ever.<br> - Even more humiliating than - Let's not do this! And then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hot tub and start making out with each other.<br> That's interesting.<br> Just one thought: You didn't mention the shoes.<br> Who's next? Chandler.<br> You start with a guy putting on the shoes.<br> - He's about my age.<br> - Your age? He's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control.<br> Maybe he falls.<br> Maybe he hurts himself.<br> Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.<br> He jumps over the old guy and laughs.<br> And the line reads: "Not suitable for adults.<br>" - Well, Chandler, that's great.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Or, man who's two years younger than me.<br> You see, that has a clear selling point.<br> It appeals to our key demographic.<br> - How did you come up with that? - I don't know! I don't know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, and stuff started to flow.<br> - That is great.<br> Good work.<br> - Thank you.<br> We'll see all of you tomorrow.<br> The cold weather hurts my hip.<br> Hey, Ross.<br> I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a sec? Sure, go ahead.<br> Oh, sorry.<br> Sure, go ahead.<br> I just really wanted to apologize again.<br> And also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.<br> Oh, my God! "Crap from the street!" Look, Ross.<br> In this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke.<br> Anyway, I was looking through it, and I found "Science Boy.<br>" Oh, my God! I never thought I'd see this again.<br> It's all here! What made you save it all these years? I guess I just thought it was really good.<br> And maybe it would be worth something one day.<br> You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving? Yeah.<br> But you should know I also have a jar of Vaseline and a cat skull in here.<br> Still, this is amazing! Oh, my God.<br> Thank you, Phoebe.<br> You're welcome.<br> Thank you for Science Boy.<br> I learned a lot from him.<br> You're welcome.<br> - I need an answer! - I can't tell you something I don't know.<br> - You know! - I don't know! - I need an answer now! - You want an answer? The answer is She never loved me.<br> She only loved you.<br> You knew this all along and you never told me? I can never forgive you, or myself.<br> I have nothing to live for.<br> Bang! And scene! Absolutely amazing.<br> - The part is yours.<br> - Thanks! Now I really gotta go.<br> No, wait! Congratulations! You did it.<br> You did it.<br> You can relax now.<br> Yeah.<br> Wow! That's a big cable bill.<br> You don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn.<br> On a Saturday afternoon? I was in the house! Hey.<br> Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that She was the huge guy that mugged you? Yeah.<br> I see.<br> You didn't happen to tell - Everybody we know? Yeah.<br> - Great.<br> Thanks.<br>   <br>
