                    			Hey, you guys.<br> Hey, what are you doing? - Figuring out our wedding plans.<br> - Funny.<br> We were doing the same thing.<br> It's really crazy.<br> The hall, the dress, the food.<br> - I had no idea how expensive this was.<br> - Yeah, it is really pricey.<br> - I freaked when I heard the numbers.<br> - So, what did you two do about it? It was simple.<br> I came up with some cost-cutting solutions wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.<br> There's no way around it.<br> Just accept that this is gonna cost a lot of money.<br> I heard that weddings are, like, a $40 billion-a-year industry.<br> Yeah.<br> And I'm responsible for just, like, half of that.<br> But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use.<br> Are you serious? Yeah.<br> How would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall? I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.<br> I gotta say, you guys, that's an incredible gesture.<br> Maybe you do that next time you get married.<br> No, no, no.<br> The next time's gonna be Hawaii at sunset.<br> But maybe the time after that.<br> The One With the Home Study - Hey.<br> What's going on? - Hey.<br> Our adoption social worker is coming, so we're cleaning the apartment.<br> "We"? You know you don't want me to help.<br> You can't have it both ways.<br> Is this the person who decides whether or not you get a baby? - She's coming to see where we live.<br> - And it has to go perfectly.<br> If she doesn't like us, she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.<br> Hey, maybe I should stop by.<br> She could be a soap opera fan.<br> It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.<br> "Little people"? "Celebrity.<br>" So I think I'm just about done here.<br> Unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like porn or cigarettes? What? - No.<br> - Chandler.<br> I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation.<br> So there's not a magazine under the couch or cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank or a filthy video in the VCR? I'll admit the cigarettes and magazine.<br> But that tape is not mine.<br> - It isn't mine.<br> - I guess we'll never know whose it is.<br> May I help you? We're here to make a rather sizable donation to the children.<br> Any contribution, large or small, is appreciated.<br> I think you're gonna appreciate the crap out of this one.<br> - Well, this is very generous.<br> - And we don't want any recognition.<br> This is completely anonymous.<br> Completely anonymous.<br> From two kind strangers.<br> Mr.<br> X and Phoebe Buffay.<br> We can put your names in our newsletter.<br> - Not necessary.<br> - Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.<br> And X is spelled "Mike Hannigan.<br>" Well, on behalf of the children, thank you both very much.<br> - I'm glad we did this.<br> It feels so good.<br> - It does.<br> It feels really good.<br> Oh, look.<br> And we get these free T-shirts.<br> Actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.<br> It's moist.<br> - Hi.<br> Emma will be up in a minute.<br> - Oh, good.<br> Hey, Ross, listen.<br> I heard about you and Charlie.<br> I'm really sorry.<br> That's okay.<br> I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.<br> - Absolutely.<br> - There was one.<br> She's it.<br> All the rest look like they should live under a bridge.<br> So, what are you gonna do today? I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground.<br> Oh, my God.<br> What? Like I said, I was thinking of taking Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.<br> Okay, look, Ross.<br> I do not want Emma going to the playground.<br> Because? All right, if you must know, I had a traumatic swing incident when I was little.<br> - Seriously? - Yes.<br> I was 4 years old.<br> And I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain.<br> And to get me out, my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair.<br> And it was uneven for weeks.<br> And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie.<br> Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.<br> I do not want Emma going there.<br> And I was thinking Claire Danes.<br> Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy.<br> But the swings are perfectly safe.<br> And besides, Emma loves them.<br> - You should come, and you'll see.<br> - Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.<br> And there's that moment when you're at the top when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to Earth.<br> Space is filled with orbiting children.<br> Look, please, just come on.<br> When you see the look on Emma's face, I swear, you won't regret it.<br> - All right.<br> - Good.<br> You don't wanna be a mom who passes her irrational fears to her children.<br> "Irrational," huh? I'll remember that next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment.<br> That's the same.<br> I'm sure there are 30 different species of poisonous swings.<br> Oh, my God.<br> The adoption lady is early.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Here we go.<br> Here we go.<br> Stand up straight.<br> Big smile.<br> Hello.<br> Is this the Creepy residence? We're waiting for the adoption lady.<br> But I'm glad you're here.<br> I was cleaning this morning and I found this.<br> I don't know if you wanna use it, but Oh, this is so sweet of you.<br> But I won't be needing a veil.<br> I actually won't be wearing a dress at all.<br> I told you, I am not coming to a naked wedding! No.<br> We're not having a big reception.<br> We took the wedding money and donated it to a children's charity.<br> That's crazy! I'm sorry.<br> I can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that.<br> Well, we're different.<br> I don't care about having a huge party.<br> This is really nice for you, but Oh, please.<br> I put this on and I just look like Well, radiant.<br> All right, but who cares? I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.<br> That's right.<br> You're making a commitment.<br> You know, that's the same whether you do it at the Plaza or - Where you gonna do it? - City Hall.<br> Oh, that sounds nice.<br> I was just there for jury duty.<br> They've really spruced that place up.<br> Okay.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay.<br> I've made my decision.<br> What I really want is a great big wedding.<br> - But you gave all the money to charity.<br> - Well, I'll just ask for it back.<br> - I don't think you can do that.<br> - Why not? This is her wedding day.<br> That's way more important than some stupid kids.<br> That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.<br> - All right, okay.<br> Be careful.<br> - Okay.<br> Careful.<br> Watch her hair.<br> Watch her hair! - Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.<br> - I know.<br> I know.<br> But they're just so beautiful.<br> Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.<br> I promise you she's safe.<br> Watch how much she loves this.<br> - Okay.<br> Okay.<br> - Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.<br> Okay, careful.<br> Okay.<br> She's smiling.<br> Look at that, she does like it.<br> See, I told you.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Look at her, she's a little daredevil.<br> - Oh, God.<br> Let me push.<br> Can I push? - Oh, absolutely.<br> Oh, God.<br> Okay, get the camera.<br> It's in the diaper bag.<br> Okay.<br> See? Scared of the swings.<br> I bet you feel pretty silly.<br> - We're asking for the money back? - It's for our wedding day.<br> Now, is this guy gay or straight? Because one of us has to start flirting.<br> You here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that's ever happened before.<br> Gay.<br> Go.<br> Oh, my God, I love your shirt.<br> The donation we made earlier? Well, we want it back.<br> Excuse me? Okay, that money was for a big wedding we thought we didn't want.<br> But it turns out we do.<br> So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children? Yeah.<br> This feels really good.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I am.<br> But this wedding's just really important to me.<br> Hey, it's none of my business.<br> Besides, this is probably a good thing.<br> We've really been spoiling the children, what with all the food and warm clothing.<br> That's not fair.<br> A person's wedding is important.<br> And especially to me.<br> I didn't have a graduation party.<br> And I didn't go to prom.<br> And I spent my sweet 16 being chased around a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who, in his own words, wanted to: "Kill me, or whatever.<br>" So I deserve a real celebration.<br> And I'm not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.<br> She could've been talking about either one of us.<br> Hi, I'm Laura.<br> I'm here for your adoption interview.<br> Hi, I'm Monica.<br> And this is Chandler.<br> - Please come in.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Would you like something to drink? - Water would be fine.<br> We're so glad that you're here.<br> We're excited about getting this process started.<br> Because we love kids.<br> Love them to death.<br> Well, not actually to death.<br> That's just a figure of speech.<br> We love kids the appropriate amount as allowed by law.<br> - Your place is just lovely.<br> - Thank you.<br> Yes, this building does have a wholesome, family feel to it.<br> I feel like I've been here before.<br> Any other couples in the building adopting? Is that that couple on the first floor? We should get a baby before them.<br> That guy tried to sell me drugs.<br> But other than that, wholesome, wholesome building.<br> - What? - I realized why I remember this place.<br> - Really? What is it? - Oh, it's nothing.<br> I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building.<br> It didn't end very well.<br> That wouldn't, by any chance, be Joey Tribbiani? - Yes! - Of course it was.<br> We had a great night.<br> In the morning, he promised he'd call and he didn't.<br> Rat bastard! - So you're not friends with him? - Oh, God, no.<br> - No, no, no.<br> - No.<br> Nope.<br> Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.<br> So are either one of you planning on staying at home? Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity? What was that? That's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here.<br> He's great with kids, though.<br> - Ross.<br> Oh, my God, are you okay? - Son of a bitch! Oh, relax.<br> I didn't say the F-word.<br> Ross, see, I told you! Those swings are evil! That's the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.<br> No, no, no.<br> Okay, it wasn't the swing's fault.<br> It was my fault.<br> And kind of that kid's fault.<br> Who is still laughing.<br> Nice.<br> Come on.<br> Can we just get out of here before somebody else gets hurt? No.<br> Wait.<br> I have an idea.<br> I want you to get on the swing and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.<br> I know what this is all about.<br> You've always been jealous of my hair.<br> I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.<br> - All right, fine.<br> I'll do it.<br> - Good.<br> - lf you hold a spider.<br> - Where?! Where?! If you hold a spider.<br> I know.<br> Guys, is everything okay? It's me, Joey.<br> Adoption! What's going on? Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy Bert, roaming the halls.<br> - Guys? - Keep on roaming, Bert! We don't want any crazy today! - What's going on? - We'll talk later! Everything's fine! Everything doesn't sound fine.<br> Is he all right out there by himself? Oh, yeah.<br> He has a caretaker.<br> His older brother Ernie.<br> - Bert and Ernie? - You can't make this stuff up.<br> You never told me about that guy and your sweet 16.<br> - I'm sorry about that.<br> - Oh, it ended okay.<br> One of my friends shot him.<br> At least you'll get a proper wedding.<br> You really deserve that.<br> Yeah, I really do.<br> You know, I had nothing growing up.<br> Just like the kids I took the money from.<br> No.<br> No, no.<br> I see where this is going.<br> Don't make me go back there.<br> Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now.<br> It's tainted.<br> Fine, we'll give the money back.<br> If that guy at the charity gives us a hard time my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.<br> I must say this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.<br> You are welcome to look under any of the furniture because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there.<br> Before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here.<br> Why don't I show you the baby's room.<br> - What are you doing? - You wouldn't let me in.<br> - I thought you were in trouble.<br> - Well, we're not.<br> But you called me "Bert.<br>" That's our code word for danger.<br> - We don't have a code word.<br> - We don't? We really should.<br> From now on, "Bert" will be our code word for danger.<br> So that was the baby's room.<br> - What room should we see next? - Any room that isn't behind this couch.<br> Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny.<br> I did not care for that.<br> You have to leave.<br> You slept with our social worker and never called her back.<br> She is still pissed, so she can't see you.<br> Okay, okay.<br> - What? - I forgot my bat.<br> Oh, my God.<br> And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't wanna buy your bat! What are you doing here? Bert.<br> Bert.<br> Bert.<br> Bert.<br> - Are you friends with him? - I can explain.<br> Joey? All right.<br> Okay.<br> You have got some nerve coming back here.<br> - I can't believe you never called me.<br> - Excuse me? You probably don't even remember my name.<br> It's Joey, by the way.<br> And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it, lady.<br> I waited weeks for you to call me.<br> I gave you my number.<br> You never called me.<br> Don't try to turn this around on me.<br> I am not some kind of social work that you can just do.<br> - I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.<br> - Really? Think about it.<br> Come on.<br> You're a beautiful woman.<br> Smart, funny.<br> We had a really good time.<br> If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you? I don't know.<br> Well, maybe I'm wrong.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Hey, too late for apologies.<br> Okay? You broke my heart.<br> You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? - Joey, wait - No! I waited a long time! I can't wait anymore.<br> I'm sorry that you had to see that.<br> I'm so embarrassed.<br> - Oh, that's really okay.<br> - Yeah.<br> We totally understand.<br> - Dating is hard.<br> - Boy, you people are nice.<br> And I've got to say I think you're going to make excellent parents.<br> Laura! We're back.<br> Are you here to take more money? Because I think what you're looking for is an ATM.<br> No, no, we're here to give the money back.<br> Yeah.<br> Because you know what? It's all about the children.<br> Although it's also about the wedding.<br> All right, here.<br> No.<br> Oh, God.<br> If I haven't said so already, sir, congratulations.<br> Okay, look, enough, all right? I'm stepping in and putting my foot down.<br> As your future husband, I'm gonna make this decision for us.<br> What do you think we should do? - It's not your decision anymore.<br> - What? On behalf of the children of New York, I reject your money.<br> - But we're giving you this.<br> - And I'm giving it back to you.<br> Come on.<br> Consider it a contribution.<br> Well, this is very generous.<br> Take the check.<br> Have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.<br> Sounds good to me.<br> We can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.<br> And when you do, ask for Brian.<br> - Oh, is that you? - No.<br> Hello? Oh, hi.<br> Oh, my God, really? I can't wait to tell Chandler.<br> Okay.<br> Goodbye.<br> - Wrong number? - That was Laura.<br> She gave us a great report and we're officially on the waiting list.<br> - That's great.<br> - Now we just wait for a call and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us.<br> Hello? Have you seen Joey's bat? Okay.<br> I got a spider.<br> There were two, I picked the bigger one.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> This feels perfectly normal.<br> Okay, get on the swing.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> - See? - All right.<br> I can do this.<br> There you go.<br> Good for you.<br> You know what? I'm getting used to this little guy.<br> - I don't even feel him in here anymore.<br> - That's because he's on your neck.<br>   <br>
