                    			Oh, my God! I know.<br> Monica's gonna have a baby! Can this count as her "something new"? Oh, my God.<br> Do you think this is why he took off? She had to have just taken it.<br> I took out the trash last night.<br> It's turning into the worst wedding ever.<br> The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing and I'm holding this.<br> Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.<br> - Right.<br> Yeah.<br> - Okay? Do you know what kind of birth control she uses? No.<br> Why? Just for the future.<br> This is hardly a commercial for it.<br> The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding Anything? No.<br> I talked to Joey.<br> He hasn't heard from him.<br> I talked to Chandler's parents again.<br> - You said he was missing? - No.<br> It seemed like I called to chat.<br> Pretty sure they both think I'm interested.<br> - We've got to tell her.<br> - No, we can't.<br> She'll start getting ready soon.<br> Can't you stall her? I'll go to the places I went last night.<br> How much time? How long before she has to get ready? - One hour.<br> - Give me two.<br> Then why do you ask? - Wish me luck.<br> - I'm going with you.<br> Why? You're tired.<br> You looked all night.<br> And clearly, you suck at this.<br> See you later.<br> Wait, do you know how you're gonna stall her? - I'll figure something out.<br> - Okay, good luck.<br> Let's start with my makeup and then do my hair.<br> Okay.<br> But before you do that, I need you to talk to me.<br> About what? I'm never gonna get married! You will.<br> The right guy's around the corner.<br> Okay, are we done with that? No, I'm serious.<br> Maybe I should just forget about it.<br> Become a lesbian or something.<br> Any woman would be lucky to have you.<br> Maybe I'd feel better if I slept with Joey.<br> Rachel? Are you okay? Excuse me, Aaron? I have a little problem with the schedule.<br> I wasn't supposed to work today.<br> I have a wedding that I have to be at.<br> It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past 4.<br> You've gotta stay until the end.<br> We can't stop filming just for you.<br> It's not like it's your wedding.<br> I'm having surgery.<br> What? I made up the wedding, because I didn't want you to worry.<br> But I'm having surgery today.<br> What kind of surgery? Transplant.<br> You're supposed to work on Monday.<br> Hair transplant.<br> But you're not bald.<br> It's not on my head.<br> There's nothing I can do.<br> You'll probably be out by 4 anyway.<br> We've got one scene.<br> It's just you and Richard, and he's a pro.<br> You'll be fine.<br> Morning, Richard.<br> Hey, you're here! Great! Let's go, buddy! We got a scene to shoot! I'm wearing two belts.<br> - Are you drunk? - No.<br> Yes, you are! All right.<br> So this is your office? How'd you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym.<br> - What the hell are you doing? - Panicking.<br> And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica.<br> - How is she? - She doesn't know you're gone.<br> And she doesn't have to know.<br> Come on, we're going home.<br> - I can't do that.<br> - Why not? If I go home, we're gonna become the Bings.<br> I can't be the Bings.<br> What's wrong with it? The Bings have bad marriages.<br> They yell, fight, and use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games.<br> Have you ever put on a black dress and asked me up to your hotel room? - No.<br> - Then you are neither of your parents.<br> It's not just their marriage.<br> Look at yours.<br> Look at everybody's.<br> Only Paul Newman can make marriage work.<br> And I am no Paul Newman.<br> I don't race cars or make popcorn.<br> None of my proceeds go to charity.<br> But look, Chandler right now no one has a lower opinion of you than I do.<br> But I totally believe you can do this.<br> I want to.<br> I love her so much, but I'm afraid It's too huge.<br> You're right.<br> It is huge.<br> So let's take it just a little bit at a time.<br> Forget getting married for a sec.<br> Can you just come home and take a shower? That's not scary, right? Depends on what you mean by "we.<br> " The nights are the hardest.<br> But then the day comes and that's every bit as hard as the night.<br> - Then the night comes - Days and nights are hard, I get it! I have to start getting ready.<br> I'm getting married today.<br> I know.<br> At dusk.<br> That's such a hard time for me.<br> I'm gonna put makeup on.<br> We have to be there in an hour.<br> - Wait! - What? Let's go to lunch! I can't go to lunch! Right.<br> Oh, good God, I've fallen down.<br> What's going on? All right, honey, listen.<br> When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, remember that we're all here for you, and we love you.<br> Okay, you're really freaking me out.<br> We can't find Chandler His vest.<br> We can't find Chandler's vest.<br> How can that be? Wait, are you serious? Found the vest.<br> We'll have to keep an eye on it, make sure we don't lose it again.<br> Oh, wow! Okay, don't scare me like that, okay? For a minute, I was like, "Oh, my God! The worst has happened! " So you two were married, huh? What happened, you just drift apart? Here comes the bride.<br> Oh, my God, Monica! I want to wear this every day.<br> You look so beautiful.<br> I'm so happy for me.<br> - Hello? - Did Chandler show up yet? - We got him back.<br> Everything's fine.<br> - Damn it! - Where are you? - I'm still on the set.<br> The wedding is in less than an hour.<br> I'm sorry.<br> The guy's drunk.<br> They won't let me go until we get it.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I'm gonna have to find another minister.<br> No, I'm the minister! Put them both on the phone and I'll marry them right now.<br> Joey, I have to go.<br> Don't hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power! There you go! You put on a tuxedo! That wasn't scary, was it? No.<br> I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.<br> Okay.<br> What's the next little bit? Getting married.<br> You can do that too.<br> Just like you've done everything else.<br> Yeah, you're right.<br> I can do that.<br> - Excuse me for a minute.<br> - Where you going? I'm not gonna run away.<br> I just want some fresh air.<br> - Okay.<br> - Okay.<br> Oh, fresh air! - Cover for me.<br> - Maybe you overreacted.<br> You do that.<br> We gotta do something.<br> Joey won't make it, so I'll look around for other weddings.<br> Don't tell them Monica's pregnant, because they frown on that.<br> Okay.<br> Anastassakis Papasifakis Wedding.<br> Excellent.<br> Congratulations.<br> Hi! Oh, great hat.<br> I need you to perform another wedding.<br> Can you do that? I don't know.<br> Are they Greek Orthodox? Yeah.<br> Yeah.<br> They're my friends, Monica Stephanopolis.<br> And Chandler Acidophilus.<br> Has anyone seen Chandler? - I thought he was with you.<br> - He was with me.<br> We're playing a game.<br> Hide-and-seek.<br> You can't ask us, son.<br> That's cheating.<br> You're right.<br> Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.<br> He can't come here and see the bride in her wedding dress.<br> When we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.<br> That was after the wedding.<br> It's not bad luck then.<br> Honey, it isn't good luck.<br> Oh, my God! Monica.<br> I know! - How's Chandler doing? - Great.<br> He's doing great.<br> Don't you worry about Chandler.<br> - Phoebe, can I see you for a second? - Yeah.<br> - What's going on? - Chandler's gone again.<br> Why would you play hide-and-seek with someone you know is a flight risk? Aaron, you gotta let me go.<br> The guy's hammered.<br> I'm sorry.<br> As long as he's here and conscious, we're still shooting.<br> You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork? So, I just talked to the director.<br> That's it.<br> We're done for the day.<br> We finished the scene? - You were wonderful.<br> - As were you.<br> So I got your car.<br> It's right outside.<br> Thank you.<br> You're welcome.<br> No, we gotta go.<br> Come on.<br> Here we go.<br> Is that my ass? - There he is! - What? You won't get away this time! Unless you want that ass-kicking we talked about! Ross! I'm serious! You're not walking out on my sister! That's right.<br> I'm not.<br> - Then where have you been? - I know about Monica.<br> - You know? - What? - I heard you and Rachel talking.<br> - About what? You don't know? If somebody doesn't tell me right now .<br> What, you'll "hi-yah"? Monica's pregnant.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> And you're not freaking out? I was.<br> Then I went to the gift shop for cigarettes.<br> - Cigarettes? - Big picture, please! So I was in the gift shop, that's when I saw this .<br> And I thought anything that can fit into this can't be scary.<br> You obviously didn't see Chuckie III.<br>  But come on, look at how cute and small this is.<br> So I got it to give Monica, so she'd know I was okay.<br> Dude.<br> Way to go, son.<br> I knew you'd find him.<br> Our little boy is getting married.<br> Look at you, so handsome.<br> You look beautiful, Mom.<br> You look beautiful too, Dad.<br> I love you both.<br> I'm so glad you're here.<br> Are you Chandler? Are you Joey? - This is nice.<br> - What? I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.<br> I wish your grandmother had lived to see this.<br> - She's right there.<br> - Not that old crone.<br> My mother.<br> Congratulations, darling.<br> We love you, sweetheart.<br> You look beautiful.<br> - Is this new? - Not now.<br> - Who's this? - I'm Father Karabasos.<br> He's Greek Orthodox.<br> As are you.<br> Let us begin.<br> Dearly beloved That's my line! I can take it from here.<br> Thanks.<br> Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late.<br> You may be confused by this now but you won't be Memorial Day weekend, 2002.<br> Let's get started before the groom takes off again.<br> We are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.<br> I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can't imagine two people more perfect for each other.<br> And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room we shall proceed to the vows.<br> Monica? - He took off? - Go on.<br> Go on.<br> Chandler, for so long I wondered if I would ever find my prince.<br> My soul mate.<br> Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort.<br> And instead, I found everything that I'd been looking for my whole life.<br> And now here we are with our future before us.<br> And I only want to spend it with you.<br> My prince.<br> My soul mate.<br> My friend.<br> Unless you don't want to.<br> You go.<br> Chandler? No, that's okay.<br> I thought this would be the most difficult thing I ever had to do.<br> But when I saw you walking down that aisle, I realized it's simple.<br> I love you.<br> Any surprises that come our way, it's okay, because I will always love you.<br> You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with.<br> You want to know if I'm sure? You may now kiss the bride.<br> I guess by the powers vested in me by the State of New York and the Internet guys I now pronounce you husband and wife.<br> Oh, wait.<br> Do you take each other? - I do.<br> - I do.<br> Yeah, you do! Rings? Oh, crap.<br> Let's do the rings.<br> We good? Yeah? Good? Once again I pronounce you husband and wife.<br> Now kiss her again.<br> I love you.<br> And I know about the baby.<br> - What baby? - Our baby.<br> We have a baby? Phoebe found your pregnancy test.<br> I didn't take a pregnancy test.<br> Then who did? Look at them.<br> And they're gonna have a baby.<br>   <br>
