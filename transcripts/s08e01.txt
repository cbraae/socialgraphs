What? - Why bother? - How do you feel? I don't know.<br> I have to make all these decisions that I don't want to make.<br> - Someone take this away from me! - Maybe you're not pregnant.<br> When I got pregnant, I took the test three times.<br> Yes.<br> Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

Of course you can.<br> Hop on.<br> But I get to hop on after her.<br> - I am so gonna score! - What? I like your bow.<br> I'd like to propose a toast to Monica and Chandler the greatest couple in the world, and my best friends.<br> When I first found out they were getting married, I was a little angry.<br> "Why, God? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over our memories together.<br> Happy memories.<br> And there were some sad memories.<br> I'm sorry.<br> And some scared memories.<br> And then I realized I'll always be their friend.<br> A friend who can speak in many dialects has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity.<br> To the happy couple.<br> - That was nice.<br> - Can we do it again? No, no.<br> - So is it my turn? - I'm next.<br> - Okay, you can dance with her first.<br> - Are you sure? - What's your name? - Gert.<br> That's pretty.<br> What are you doing, Gert? Dancing on your feet like the other girls.<br> Okay.<br> Hop on, Gert.<br> - Why aren't you moving your feet? - I'm trying.<br> You're not going fast enough.<br> Maybe I should stand on your feet! Did you happen to catch my toast? - Was that for my benefit? - There was something for everyone.<br> - I know you're casting for a show.<br> - I don't think you're right for it.<br> You're wrong.<br> Whatever it is, I can do it.<br> - Try me.<br> - It's an all-Chinese cast.<br> Can you be Chinese? - I'm not proud of this, but - No, please! - Want to go back to the dance floor? - Did it turn into sand? - Come on, you'll be fine.<br> - No, I won't.<br> Know why I took all those lessons? I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen with some clumsy idiot.<br> You could never embarrass me.<br> Okay, you could easily do that.<br> But it doesn't matter.<br> I married you.<br> So I'm gonna dance with my husband.<br> Just try not to move your feet at all.<br> There you go.<br> I'm gonna have you arrested.<br> You stole my moves.<br> - How much longer? - Thirty seconds.<br> Did I miss it? Rachel, I want you to know that if it's positive, we - I know.<br> - You do? Okay.<br> It's time.<br> No! - Go ahead, Rach.<br> - I can't look at it.<br> Somebody tell me.<br> It's negative.<br> - What? - It's negative.<br> Well, there you go.<br> That's really great, great news.<br> Because the whole not being ready, the financial aspects, all that This is just the way it was supposed to be.<br> Well then, great.<br> This is so stupid.<br> How can I be upset over something I never had? - It's negative? - No, it's positive.<br> - What? - It's not negative, it's positive.<br> - Are you sure? - Yeah, I lied before.<br> - Now you know how you really feel.<br> - That's a risky little game.<br> Are you really gonna do this? I'm gonna have a baby.<br> I'm gonna have a baby! - With who? - No, it's still not the time.<br> I just didn't see the fast song coming.<br> Don't try to talk.<br> We'll get you up to your room, soak your feet.<br> That's so sweet! There's so few genuinely nice guys out there.<br> I feel like I'm holding down the fort all alone.<br> - It's Joey, right? - Yeah.<br> Wait a minute! I'm the nice one! I danced with the kids all night.<br> How small are your feet?   <br>
