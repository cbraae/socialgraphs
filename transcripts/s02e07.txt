                    			What is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something repellent about me? How was the party? It couldn't have been worse.<br> A woman literally passed through me.<br> What is it? Am I hideously unattractive? No, you are not.<br> You are very attractive.<br> I go through the same thing.<br> When I put on a little weight, I question everything.<br> I've put on weight? Did you want to? No, not weight.<br> More like insulation.<br> I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.<br> Wanna work out? I can remake you.<br> I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.<br> Please? Come on, let her do it! All right.<br> If we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.<br> Your boobs are fine.<br> I shouldn't have said anything.<br> Come here.<br> Come here! Can't make hands meet! The One Where Ross Finds Out Let's do it! What? Nothing.<br> Just never seen your little stretchy pants before.<br> It's cute! And we're changing.<br> Come on, give me five more! Five more! Five more and I'll flash you.<br> One two two and a half.<br> Just show me one of them.<br> She's insane! The woman is insane.<br> It's before work, after work, and during work.<br> She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.<br> And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.<br> Just tell her you want to stop.<br> I can't.<br> All she get to work is all she can got.<br> So that's why we think maybe we should all picking and buy her own resterant.<br> Hey, Pheebs.<br> How'd it go with Scott? It was nice.<br> Took him to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne.<br> Nice.<br> He still won't put out? Nope.<br> Zilch.<br> Nothing.<br> Sorry, Pheebs.<br> Look, I don't mind taking it slow.<br> I like him a lot.<br> He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.<br> Why won't he give it up? Maybe he drives his car on the other side of the road.<br> If you know what I mean.<br> No.<br> What do you mean? He's not British.<br> Maybe he's gay.<br> I don't think that's the problem.<br> We went dancing the other night and just the way he held me so close and looked into my eyes.<br> I just definitely felt something.<br> But how much can you tell from a look? I felt it on my hip.<br> I could tell.<br> Yo, Bing! Racquetball in 20 minutes.<br> Joey, be a pal.<br> Lift up my hand and smack her with it.<br> Oh, Rachel! Don't look.<br> What? I don't care.<br> I have a date tonight.<br> You have a date? Monica's setting me up.<br> What about Ross and.<br> What? My whole insane jealousy thing?

That's Julie.<br> -Hi, Julie.<br> -I've got a cab waiting.<br> I'll be right down! Wait, so you're going?

I can't find the remote.<br> Thank you.<br> Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.<br> -And? -And we did.<br> All right! Way to go! Yea, me! So how did it happen? I took your advice and asked him what was going on.<br> What did he say? He understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.<br> And he was just afraid that I was going to get all: "ls he gonna call me the next day?" and "Where is this going?" So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.<br> So I said, "Okay.<br> Relax, please.<br>" Sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.<br> If he wants to see me again, he can call.<br> If not, that's fine too.<br> So after a lot of talking  I convinced him.<br> Let me get this straight.<br> He got you to beg to sleep with him.<br> He got you to say he never has to call you again.<br> And he got you thinking this is a great idea? This man is my god! This one is cute.<br> Don't you think.<br> Yeah.<br> This one is cute, that one is cute, and they are all cute.<br> Let's just wrap one and get the hell out of here.<br> -Are you OK! -yeah, me, sure! You know this is the big step for us, but I'm got feeling that will be OK.<br> I know, I know! Do you have any cat really old and incrediblly sick.<br> Rose, I don't want one suppose to die.<br> See, we should work that out before we came down here.<br> I will get a little narrow down with this one over here and this one with the stricks.<br> You pick! -I have to pick? -whickever one you want.<br> I don't know.<br>I mean it's not easy to choose.<br> You know both cat are beautiful,funny.<br> You will be happy with either cat.<br> Do you want to take both? I can't have two cats.<br> Joey is kind of guy to have two cats.<br> I didn't get a cat.<br> That's interesting.<br> No, it's not "interesting.<br>" It's very, very not interesting.<br> It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.<br> I got it, Ross.<br> You had no right to say you had feelings for me.<br> I was doing great with Julie before I knew! I was doing great before I knew about you! You think it's easy to see you with Julie? You should've said something before! I didn't know then.<br> And how come you never said anything? There was never a good time.<br> You only had a year.<br> And we only hung out every night! Not every night.<br> It's not like I didn't try.<br> But things got in the way.<br> You know, like ltalian guys or ex-fiances or ltalian guys.<br> There was one ltalian guy, okay? And do you have a point? The point is, I don't need this right now! Okay? It's too late.<br> I'm with somebody else.<br> I'm happy.<br> This ship has sailed! You're just gonna put away your feelings for me? I've done it since ninth grade.<br> I'm good at it.<br> All right, fine.<br> You go ahead and do that.<br> I don't need your ship! -Good.<br> -Good! And you know what? Now I got closure! Try the bottom one.<br> Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.<br> We're not working out.<br> It's over.<br> No way! With one pound to go? Come on! We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin' I don't mind the last pound.<br> In fact, I kind of like the last pound.<br> So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.<br> What you gonna do, fat boy? What? Nothing.<br> Except tell you it's wonderful how much energy you have.<br> Well, thanks.<br> Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.<br> You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.<br> It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.<br> Well, no.<br> But l.<br> If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.<br> You know, I try to stay positive.<br> So you.<br> You feel like going for a run?
