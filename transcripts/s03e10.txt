Remember when you first came here and you got trained by another waitress? Sure! Do you need me to train somebody new? Good one.<br> Actually, Terry wants you to take the training again.<br> Whenever.<br> Do you believe that? Yeah.<br> The One Where Rachel Quits .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons.<br> On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.<br> Just admit it.<br> You have no backhand.<br> Excuse me, little one.<br> I have a very solid backhand.<br> Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is not a backhand.<br> I was shrieking.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Iike a Marine.<br> All right, watch me execute the three P's of championship play.<br> Power.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>precision.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and panache.<br> You broke a little girl's leg? I know.<br> I feel horrible, okay? It says here that a Muppet got whacked on Sesame Street last night.<br> Where exactly were you around 1 0-ish? I'm going to see her.<br> I wanna bring her something.<br> -What would she like? -A Hello Kitty doll? The ability to walk? I'm gonna get back to retraining.<br> All right.<br> See you, guys.<br> Look out, kids! He's coming! I gotta go sell Christmas trees.<br> Have fun.<br> Oh, wait! No, don't! I forgot.<br> I am totally against that now.<br> What? Me having a job? No, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and their corpses grotesquely dressed.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.<br> How do you sleep at night? Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around.<br> You got this all wrong.<br> Those trees were born to be Christmas trees.<br> They're fulfilling their life purpose by making people happy.<br> Really? Yes! Yes, and the trees are happy too.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because for most of them, it's their only.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>chance to see New York.<br> After you deliver the drinks, take the tray-- Gunther, please.<br> I have worked here for two and a half years.<br> I know the empty trays go over there.<br> What if you put them here? That's actually a good idea.<br> They'll be closer to the mugs.<br> You should have the other waitresses do that too.<br> They already do.<br> That's why they call it the tray spot.<br> I heard them talk about that.<br> I just thought it was a club they went to.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> -It's all right.<br> Sweetheart.<br> So this must be kind of neat for you, huh? Your dad tells me you get school off.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you don't have to sell those cookies anymore.<br> I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.<br> Whoever sells the most wins a trip to Space Camp.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and gets to sit in a real shuttle.<br> You really like all this space stuff, huh? My dad says if I'd spend as much time helping him clean apartments.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>as I do daydreaming about outer space.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.<br> You'd have to clean a lot of apartments to go all the way to lndia.<br> No.<br> The one in Atlantic City.<br> Dad loves the slots.<br> He says he'll double the college money Grandma left me.<br> Well, good luck to Dad.<br> Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win? The girl who won last year sold 475.<br> So far, I've sold 75.<br> Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds doable.<br> How much are the boxes? Five dollars a box.<br> And what is second prize? A 1 0-speed bike.<br> But I'd rather have something my dad couldn't sell.<br> Well, that makes sense.<br> Could you do me one favor? Yeah, Sarah.<br> Anything.<br> Could you pull the curtains open? The shuttle astronauts are gonna be on the news.<br> We don't have a Tv, so the lady across the alley.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>said she'd push hers up to her window so I can watch it.<br> Yes? Hi.<br> I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.<br> You're no Brown Bird.<br> I can see you through my peephole.<br> Hi.<br> I'm an honorary Brown Bird.<br> What does that mean? It means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleepovers.<br> I can dial 91 1 at the press of a button, you know.<br> Now, go away! Please, please.<br> It's for a poor little girl.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who wants to go to Space Camp more than anything in the world.<br> I'm pressing.<br> A policeman is on his way.<br> Okay, okay! I'm going, I'm going.<br> I can still see you! All right! -What are you doing here? -I thought a lot about what you said.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I realize maybe I was a little judgmental.<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, but, oh.<br> Now, now, Phoebe, remember.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they're just fulfilling their Christmas-- -Destiny.<br> Yes.<br> -Sure.<br> That one doesn't look very fulfilled.<br> That's one of the old ones.<br> He's just taking it to the back.<br> You keep the old ones in the back? That is so ageist.<br> We're making room for the fresh ones.<br> So what happens to the old guys? They go into the chipper.<br> I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds.<br> These are shaped like Christmas characters.<br> Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.<br> I'll take a box of the cream-filled Jesuses.<br> One box? I'm trying to send a little girl to Space Camp.<br> I'm putting you down for 5 boxes.<br> What about you? All right.<br> Do you have any coconut-flavored deities? No, but there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.<br> I'll put you down for 8 boxes.<br> One for each night.<br> Mon? I'll take a box of the Mint Treasures.<br> One, and that's it.<br> I gained weight after I joined the Brown Birds.<br> Remember? Dad bought every one of my boxes and I ate them all.<br> No, Mon.<br> Dad had to buy every one of your boxes.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because you ate them all.<br> But, you know, I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.<br> Why don't I put you down for 3 Mint Treasures and a couple of Rudolphs? No.<br> Oh, come on, now.<br> You know you want them.<br> Don't do this.<br> I'll tell you what, I'll give you the first box for free.<br> Oh, God! I gotta go! Come on! All the cool kids are eating them.<br> And later, I'll show you why we don't just trap spiders.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>under coffee mugs and leave them there.<br> I'm training to be better at a job that I hate.<br> My life officially sucks! Wasn't this supposed to be temporary? You wanted to do fashion stuff.<br> Yeah, I'm still pursuing that.<br> How, exactly, are you pursuing that? Other than sending out resumes, like, what? Two years ago? Well, I'm also sending out.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>good thoughts.<br> If you ask me, as long as you got this job.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you got nothing pushing you to get another one.<br> You need The Fear.<br> -The Fear? -He's right.<br> Quit this job, and you'll have motivation to go after a job you really want.<br> Why are you still at a job you hate? Why don't you quit and get The Fear? Because I'm too afraid.<br> I don't know.<br> I'd give anything to work for a designer or a buyer.<br> I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.<br> Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28 and still working here.<br> Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.<br> Can't I just look at the handles on them? You would think.<br> Okay, fine.<br> Gunther, you know what? I am a terrible waitress.<br> Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because I don't care.<br> I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf.<br> I don't care where the tray spot is.<br> I just don't care.<br> This is not what I want to do.<br> So I don't think I should do it anymore.<br> -I'm giving my week's notice.<br> -What? Gunther, I quit.<br> Does this mean we have to start paying for coffee? Okay, 1 2.<br> Twenty-two.<br> Eighteen.<br> What? I spelled out "boobies" .<br> Put me down for another box of the Mint Treasures, okay? Where are the Mint Treasures? We're out.<br> I sold them all.<br> What? Monica, I'm cutting you off.<br> Just a couple more boxes.<br> It's no big deal, all right? I'm cool.<br> You gotta help me with a couple more boxes! Look at yourself.<br> You have cookie on your neck.<br> Oh, God! -So how many you sold so far? -Check this out.<br> -Five hundred and seventeen boxes! -Oh, my God! How did you do that? The other night I was leaving the museum.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium.<br> Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me.<br> The key to my success: The munchies.<br> So I started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.<br> I am selling cookies by the case.<br> They call me "Cookie Dude" ! Stop what you're doing.<br> I need envelope stuffers, stamp lickers.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -Who did these resumes for you? -Me.<br> On my computer.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, "Waitress at a Coffeehouse" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain" only took up so much room.<br> Hey, that's funny! You're funny, Chandler! You're a funny guy! You know what else is funny? Something else I might have said? I don't know.<br> Weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>when I had absolutely nothing else to do? Calm down.<br> It's gonna be okay.<br> No, it's not gonna be okay.<br> Tomorrow is my last day.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I don't have a lead.<br> You know what? I'm just gonna call Gunther.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and tell him I'm not quitting.<br> You don't want to give in to The Fear.<br> You and your stupid Fear! I hate your Fear! I would like to take you and your Fear-- Hey! I got great news! Run, Joey! Run for your life! What? Rach, listen.<br> Have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions? My dad's got a plumbing job there and he heard there's an opening.<br> You want him to get you an interview? Oh, my God, yes! I would love that! That's so sweet, Joey.<br> Not a problem.<br> And now, for the great news.<br> That wasn't the great news? Only if you think it's better than this.<br> Snow-in-a-Can! You want me to decorate the window? Give it kind of a Christmas looky? Christmas cookie? Okay, and this one here's a Douglas fir.<br> Now, it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.<br> Looks good.<br> I'll take it.<br> Wait, wait.<br> No, no! You don't want that one! No, no.<br> You can have this cool brown one.<br> It's almost dead.<br> That's why you have to buy it, to fulfill its Christmas destiny.<br> Otherwise, they'll throw it into the chipper.<br> Tell him.<br> Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill their Christmas destiny.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>are thrown in the chipper.<br> I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.<br> You gotta stop doing this.<br> I'm working on commission here! I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.<br> Well, look no further! This one's yours! Is this the one that I threw out last year? Never mind! Everybody wants a green one! I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to get so emotional.<br> The holidays are just hard.<br> Oh, honey.<br> Is that because your mom died around Christmas? I wasn't even thinking about that.<br> Hi there.<br> How many did you sell? I'm not gonna tell you.<br> You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.<br> Hey, now.<br> That was an accident, okay? You're a big scrud.<br> What's a scrud? Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud? I don't have to.<br> I can just look at you.<br> All right, girls.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and man.<br> Let's see your final tallies.<br> Debbie.<br> Three hundred and twenty-one boxes of cookies.<br> very nice.<br> Not nice enough.<br> Charla.<br> Two hundred and seventy-eight.<br> Sorry, dear, but still good.<br> Good for a scrud.<br> Yes, Elizabeth.<br> Eight hundred and seventy-one.<br> That's crap!
