                    			Hello.<br> Hello.<br> I love my new job! - Honey, you're screaming.<br> - You bet your ass I am! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen? Twice as big as Allessandro's.<br> Oh, that's great.<br> And clean? Not just health department-clean, Monica-clean! Awesome.<br> Oh, and the people are so nice.<br> There's this one guy, Jeffrey, he's the maitre d'.<br> Chandler, you will love him! He is without a doubt the funniest guy I have ever met! The One With The Male Nanny mrnch@dh.<br>net.<br>mk Subtitle Editor (c) Digital Higherground - Igor Janevski, 2004 - This is nice.<br> - I know.<br> - You need both hands for that? - Yeah, I kind of do.<br> Well, how's this? Look at you two holding hands.<br> Is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's obviously way too early for us to be having that conversation.<br> - Is it? - Maybe not.<br> Is it? When I got divorced I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time.<br> Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you.<br> And This may be crazy-soon, but I want you to have this.<br> No, not That's gum.<br> Oh, five bucks! I love it when that happens, you know? - You don't know it's there - I know.<br> Keep digging.<br> Sorry.<br> It's a key.<br> To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.<br> - It's to my apartment.<br> - Wow! Big step for Phoebe and Mike.<br> I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key - No, I want to.<br> - Thank God.<br> Wow.<br> I was starting to think I'd never meet someone that I wanted to do this with.<br> Here you go.<br> - This is cool.<br> - It really is.<br> I know it.<br> It is amazing.<br> These little things open doors! So I don't go back to work for another four weeks but we would like our nanny to start right away so that Emma could get a chance to know her.<br> I think that's really smart.<br> The easier we can make the transition for her the better.<br> That's great.<br> Great.<br> - So do you have any questions for us? - Not really.<br> All right.<br> Well, thank you so much for coming.<br> - Thank you.<br> - It was really nice to meet you.<br> - We will call you.<br> - Oh, you know, wait.<br> I do have one question.<br> Do you guys do random drug testing? Boy, we hadn't really thought of that.<br> That's cool.<br> But if you do, I'm gonna need three days' notice.<br> Okey-dokey! We're never gonna find a nanny.<br> Come on, Rach.<br> We will.<br> I promise.<br> We have more interviews.<br> Worse comes to worst, we can always reconsider the first one we met with.<br> - What, the blond with no bra? - She was blond? Just a sec.<br> Okay, this one's name is Sandy.<br> She's got a degree in Early Childhood Education.<br> She worked for her last family for three years.<br> Hi.<br> I'm Sandy.<br> And she's a little mannish.<br> Oh, my God! David! - Is this a bad time? - No, it's a great time! Come in! Wow! Hi! Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk? Just for a couple of days.<br> I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant why it's a positive thing that we've spent all their money and accomplished nothing.<br> Who cares? It got you here.<br> It got me to New York.<br> Then I got in a cab at the airport and the guy said, "Where to?" I just gave him your address.<br> I didn't even think about it.<br> Where's your luggage? Damn it.<br> All right, I'll call the cab company.<br> We can call them later.<br> Can you just stand there for a moment? Boy.<br> There's an old Russian expression that goes: Roughly translated, that means: "This thing that I'm looking at: Wow.<br>" Thank you.<br> You should see me when Actually, no, I look pretty good.<br> Are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time you build them up in your head, you start thinking: "Come on, don't be crazy, nobody's that beautiful.<br>" But, well, you are.<br> Well, so are you seeing anyone? No.<br> I'm just the worst person ever! How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike? Maybe he didn't give you a chance.<br> He said, "Are you seeing someone?" And I said, "No.<br>" Well, that would've been your window.<br> I mean, I don't know.<br> I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking, "Oh, my God, it's David.<br> David's here.<br>" He's so irresistible.<br> - Really? The scientist guy? - Really? Chandler? Continue.<br> Then it gets worse because I told him I would see him tomorrow night.<br> - Phoebe! - I know! Evil! I like Mike so much, you know? It's just going really well.<br> Oh, my God! Isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys? Yeah.<br> You know, and given my lifelong search for irony you can imagine how happy I am! - What are you gonna do? - I mean, I guess I just have to tell David that nothing can happen between us.<br> Unless I don't.<br> You know, complicated moral situation? - No right, no wrong? - You have to tell David.<br> I knew I should've had this conversation with Joey.<br> Funniest guy she's ever met.<br> I'm funny, right? What do you know? You're a door.<br> You just like knock-knock jokes.<br> Save it for inside.<br> So Oklahoma's a crazy place.<br> You know, they call it the Sooner State.<br> Frankly, I'd sooner be in any other state! And what's with Oklahoma having a panhandle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey, yeah, I'm from the waistband of Wyoming.<br> But when I was 7, we headed over to the crotch.<br> Was your cabin pressurized? And don't get me started on the way the people from Tulsa talk.<br> Okay.<br> What's with the word "y'all"? You know, just two words just pushed together? Are we all allowed to do that? Because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle.<br> And fried chicken could be fricken.<br> Waiter? Waiter, excuse me, I'll have the fricken! See, that's funny with the fricken, right? No, it just reminds me of something this guy did today at work.<br> I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey, right? Yeah, he came up.<br> Well, he did this bit.<br> You probably had to be there but it was Liza Minnelli locked in our freezer eating a raw chicken.<br> - Were you there? - No, but it sounds fricken funny.<br> I really understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person.<br> I mean, it's like leaving behind a piece of your heart.<br> Sandy, that's exactly what it is.<br> Are you gay? It's okay.<br> I get that a lot doing what I do.<br> But I am straight.<br> I'm engaged, actually.<br> - Her name's Delia.<br> - That's pretty.<br> So you're just, like, a guy who's a nanny.<br> I realize how it's a bit unorthodox for some people.<br> But I really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life is take care of a child.<br> Okay.<br> Like at my last job.<br> I met Daniel when he was And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person.<br> When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon.<br>" And he said to me, "Skadandy?" That was his name for me.<br> "I'll see you every day right in" - It's okay.<br> - Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.<br> Oh, God, she must need her diaper changed.<br> - I can take care of that, if you want.<br> - That would be great.<br> I love him, I love him, I love him! Come on.<br> Rach, he's a guy! So what? He's smart.<br> He's qualified.<br> Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.<br> Because it's weird! Why? What kind of a job is that for a man? A nanny? I mean, it's like if a woman wanted to be Yes? King? I hope you don't mind.<br> I used some of my homemade lotion on Emma.<br> It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream.<br> It'll dry that rash right up.<br> Plus, it keeps the hands young.<br> Yes! Sandy, you're hired! That's great! I'm sorry.<br> It's just such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family.<br> Oh, God.<br> Come here.<br> You gotta be at least bi.<br> I need you to set me up for a joke.<br> When Monica's around, ask me about fire trucks.<br> I don't know, Chandler.<br> I'm not so good with remembering lines.<br> Thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.<br> I know, right? Why are we doing this? Monica says that her maitre d' is the funniest guy she's ever met.<br> - Seriously? She actually said that? - Yes.<br> Am I crazy to be this upset? - No! Being funny's your thing! - Yeah! Without that, you just got "lame with women"! Hi! There you are.<br> Fire trucks! Wow.<br> You look even more beautiful than you did yesterday.<br> In fact, I'm going to kiss you now.<br> - Wait, wait.<br> - I can't get away with stuff like that.<br> It sounded sexy in my head, so I No, no, it's not that.<br> Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, I am.<br> His name's Mike.<br> - I should've told you.<br> - No.<br> Well, yeah.<br> - I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - Well, it's okay.<br> I understand.<br> Well, are you happy with this guy? - I am happy.<br> - Damn it.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I don't mean that.<br> I want you to be happy.<br> But only with me.<br> No, that's not fair.<br> Who cares.<br> Leave him.<br> I don't mean that.<br> Yes, I do.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I think I should probably go.<br> But, David, I just want you to know that, you know telling you this is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.<br> Well, just so you know hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival, either.<br> - Can we at least hug goodbye? - Of course.<br> Yeah.<br> You know, and a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate.<br> - No.<br> No.<br> - I mean - In Minsk? - Yeah? It's two on each cheek and one on the lips.<br> - Well, if that's what they do in Minsk.<br> In New York, it's Oh, boy.<br> Is everything all right? Oh, yeah.<br> No, it's fine.<br> It's fine.<br> Sandy was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancee and it was so beautiful.<br> Her favorite flower is the camellia.<br> From the poem I can't hear it again! You know, I can't tell it again! And I'm fine never having heard it.<br> - Rach, can I see you for a sec? - Yeah.<br> Excuse me.<br> Do you realize that man has cried in our apartment three times? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in! Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.<br> That's all.<br> Okay, okay.<br> See, that is the problem.<br> He is too sensitive.<br> Too sensitive to take care of our baby? No, I mean, that guy These are amazing! Sandy made madeleines.<br> This is exactly what I'm talking about.<br> What kind of a guy makes delicate French cookies? They're not even butch, manly cookies with You know, with chunks! Well, you know, I don't know what to say.<br> I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.<br> I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like you just came in from branding cattle.<br> Hey, there's sensitive and there's too sensitive.<br> Okay, what is too sensitive? No, I can't.<br> I can't do this.<br> It's bad.<br> But it's nice.<br> And nice is good.<br> And good is not bad.<br> Ergo, we should keep kissing.<br> - No, no.<br> No.<br> - But Ergo.<br> Look, David, if you had never left, then yeah, we'd probably still be together right now.<br> But you did leave.<br> And I'm with Mike and I really care about him.<br> Goodbye.<br> The key works.<br> And, you, thanks for the face massage! Thank you! Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny? I think that's great! Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes madeleines? - How are they? - Lighter than air, but that's not the point.<br> Rachel and I hired a male nanny.<br> Really? Guys do that? - That's weird.<br> - Thank you! - That's like a woman wanting to be - What? - What's the end of that sentence? - Yes.<br> What is the end of that sentence? A penis model! Anyway, did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you ever met? - Yeah.<br> So? - Wow! Really? Do you not know Chandler? Is that why he's acting so weird? He's jealous? Oh, my God, that is crazy.<br> - It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.<br> - So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing.<br> Like Ross' thing is Science? Academia? Being a good father? - I can't believe he's that upset.<br> - You have to do some damage control.<br> Because he's feeling like What are you guys talking about? Rachel and I hired a male nanny.<br> You got a man who's a nanny? You got a "manny"? You know, I don't mind a male nanny but I do draw the line at male wet nurse.<br> You are on a roll, mister! If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would've brought more pizza.<br> Okay! Okay! Stop it, you! You stop it! What is so funny about that? I don't know, it's Just the way you say it.<br> I mean, you're funny.<br> You have that funny thing.<br> You're a funny guy! Did you tell her what we talked about? So those were pity laughs? Pity laughs?! Honey, listen.<br> You have nothing to worry about with Jeffrey.<br> Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me? Well, you're different funny.<br> I mean, you're more sarcastic.<br> Well, he does bits and impressions and limericks.<br> I do limericks.<br> There once was a man named Chandler whose wife made him die inside.<br> Honey, you know I think you're hilarious.<br> You know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye.<br> That slayed me.<br> Hey! I made up that joke and told it to you.<br> - Not knowing when to shut up.<br> - Yep, that's my thing.<br> So how many guys have your key? It's not as bad as it looks.<br> I was saying goodbye to an old friend.<br> Your lipstick's on his mouth.<br> We just happen to wear the same shade.<br> No, David and I did used to go out.<br> But years ago.<br> And he lives in Minsk.<br> He's only in town for a couple days.<br> - Did you? - No.<br> No.<br> - Kiss him? - Oh, well, yeah.<br> Yes, but you should know, she really likes you.<br> In fact, I don't think you realize just how lucky you are, fella.<br> - Don't point your finger at me! - Why? What are you gonna do about it? Well, I'll show you what I'm gonna do about it.<br> - Oh, really? Really? - You want some of that? Stop it! Stop it! Before someone gets really hurt! Here, David, you should just go.<br> All right.<br> But if I ever do come back from Minsk, well, you just better watch out.<br> - Lf I go to Minsk, you better watch out.<br> - Oh, you're going to Minsk? - Well, I might.<br> - Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring.<br> It's just lovely there.<br> Okay, well, guys? - Goodbye, Phoebe.<br> - Bye.<br> - Hey, what, are you kidding me? - Right-o.<br> Right-o.<br> Take good care of her.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> If you want your key back, I totally understand.<br> - It's never gonna happen again, right? - Right.<br> Never.<br> I swear.<br> I just want to say, if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number.<br> We'll party up Vladnik-style.<br> Yeah! All right! Hey, Ross! Check it out! Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns"! Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice.<br>" - "Three Blind Mice" goes like this.<br> - I swear to God.<br> - Who's up for puppets? - Me! I'm up for puppets! Well, please welcome: The Snufflebumps! Who wants to be Mr.<br> Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus? How exactly is a 2-month-old supposed to appreciate puppets? Studies show that the movement and colors help their cerebral development.<br> The whimsical characters are just for us.<br> I want to be Mr.<br> Wigglemunch! Oh, my God.<br> Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus! - That was kind of rude.<br> - Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Please apologize to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.<br> - You know, he was just doing his job.<br> - You know what? I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there.<br> But I just I can't go through with this.<br> - Come on.<br> - No! You know what? I would never force you to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with.<br> That's true.<br> Thank you.<br> You want to fire him, so you have to go do it.<br> So you see, Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to share.<br> I am learning so much from you.<br> Well, I'm off to Tulsa.<br> So if your maitre d' friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes tell him to e-mail me at www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com! Honey, you can relax.<br> Last night at work Jeffrey told this really sexist joke.<br> - After that, not so funny anymore.<br> - Really? See, that's the thing.<br> You gotta keep it smart, people! Don't miss that flight.<br> You know I love you.<br> I love you too.<br> - And I like you as a friend.<br> - Right.<br> - See you later.<br> - See you.<br> - Did the guy really make that joke? - No, he still kills me.<br> Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear a little pee came out.<br> Here goes.<br> I can't watch.<br> It's like firing Elmo.<br> Sandy? Hi.<br> - Hi.<br> - We We kind of need to talk.<br> I'm afraid it's not working out.<br> I mean, Rachel and I think you are great with Emma.<br> - We just feel - You! You feel! I just feel that the chemistry isn't right.<br> I'm sorry.<br> We're more than happy to give you a good recommendation.<br> No, that's okay.<br> I had a lot of offers from other families.<br> I just picked you guys because I liked you the best.<br> - Oh, damn you, Geller! Anyway, well I'm glad there's no hard feelings.<br> None at all.<br> You need to be happy with whoever is in your home.<br> Although, if you don't mind telling me what was the problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.<br> No, you know, it's nothing you did.<br> It's my issue.<br> What is it? Please? You know, I'm just not that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.<br> That's fair.<br> Although, can I ask, why do you think that is? Why? I don't know.<br> Maybe because of my father? You know, when I was growing up, he was a tough guy.<br> You know, and as a kid, I wasn't the athlete I am now.<br> I play squash! Anyway, I always got the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.<br> That must have been hard.<br> It was hard.<br> I remember I was in my bedroom, playing with my dinosaurs Playing and learning.<br> And my father walks in and says, "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you? Why aren't you outside playing like a real boy?" - But you are a real boy.<br> - I know I am! And when it's summer and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?! It's all right.<br> Crying is good.<br> It lets the boo-hoos out.<br> Here comes some more! And what's the one kind of boat that can never ever sink? - What kind? - A friend ship! Wow! You blow my mind! I gotta go.<br> - How much do I owe you? - Twenty bucks.<br> It's like the cheapest college ever!   <br>
