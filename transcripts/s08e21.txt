That's right! You'll find that I don't micromanage.<br> I don't shy away from delegating.<br> That's good to know.<br> But let's stop focusing on what you don't do and focus on what you do do.<br> What I do do is create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.<br> Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.<br> - Hardest thing I've ever done.<br> - Oh, you gotta go! - Don't worry.<br> You're ready.<br> - Really? Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts, and you'll be great.<br> Monica, my star student.<br> You called me that before, so I fashioned a star out of foil.<br> Now, no pressure.<br> If you like my cookies, you give me the star.<br> Wow, a star!

Okay.<br> I don't want to go.<br> I'm having fun.<br> Did either of you pay for this class? Hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go! I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL5 to GR6 systems.<br> - You must have had your hands full.<br> - That I did.<br> That I did.<br> So let's talk a little bit about your duties.<br> My duties? All right.<br> You'll be heading a division, so you'll have a lot of duties.<br> I see.<br> But there'll be 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.<br> - Good to know.<br> - We could go into detail No, don't, I beg of you.<br> All right.<br> We'll have a definite answer for you Monday.<br> But I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.<br> - Really? - Absolutely.<br> - You can relax.<br> You did great.<br> - Yeah, thanks.<br> I was really nervous.<br> I'm told I come on too strongly.<br> And then it was really hard to side step that "duty" thing.<br> Duties? Doodies? Poo? Poo? Oh, my God.<br> This doesn't count.<br> Okay? The interview was over.<br> That was the real Chandler Bing.<br> This is some crazy guy.<br> Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall! Poo? I'll look forward to your call.<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey.<br> - You're back.<br> - How are you? I'm fine.<br> But that's not important.<br> What's important is how was she? It was fun.<br> We just had coffee.<br> Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table? What's going on? Do you not like Katie? No.<br> No, she was nice.<br> I mean, she was a little slutty, but who isn't? Well, I liked her.<br> Of course you did.<br> You'd date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones.<br> Did you get a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today? No.<br> It's just that Katie bothered me.<br> Why? What was wrong with her? There was nothing wrong with her.<br> She was lovely.<br> - Okay.<br> So, what's the matter? - I don't want you to date her.<br> Why? What, are you jealous? Yes.<br> And not because I want you to go out with me.<br> Because I don't want you to go out with anybody.<br> It's terrible to even think this and it's inappropriate but I want you to be at my constant beck and call, 24 hours a day.<br> I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.<br> - Okay.<br> - What? I won't date.<br> I'll I'll be here with you all the time.<br> Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.<br> True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable.<br> You're having our baby.<br> Oh, Ross, thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> You feel better?

Okay.<br> Because for a minute you seemed - No, it's just like you actually That's just because I'm such a good messer! - Rach? - Yeah? - The bathroom? - Right.<br> I had fun.<br> I learned how to bake, ate great food.<br> It's my first A since 7th grade and I didn't even sleep with the teacher.<br> - Oh, look.<br> Acting for Beginners.<br> - Yeah.<br> - Wanna feel good about yourself? - What the hell! Let's start with some basics.<br> Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is? Yeah, this was a stupid idea.<br>   <br>
