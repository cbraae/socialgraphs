                    			Mom, would you relax? That was 10 blocks from here, and any women won't walking alone at night.<br> I would never do that.<br> Mom, come on, stop worrying.<br> This is a safe street.<br> This is a safe building.<br> There's nothing Oh, my God! What are you doing in here?! Mom, I gotta go! IT gotta go! Oh, my God! That's fine, you just read the paper.<br> I'm gonna get a pot.<br> It's not for you.<br> Okay, that's fine.<br> Read the Family Circus enjoy the gentle comedy.<br> Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God.<br> It's open, you guys.<br> Can I help you? Does Phoebe still live here? No, she doesn't.<br> But I can get a message to her.<br> Great.<br> Just tell her her husband stopped by.<br> Her what? How did you do that? The One With Phoebe's Husband This is unbelievable, Pheebs.<br> How can you be married? I'm not "married" married, you know? He's just a friend, and he's gay and he was from Canada, and he needed a Green Card.<br> I can't believe you married Duncan! How could you not tell me? We told each other everything.<br> I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd get judgmental and wouldn't approve.<br> Of course I wouldn't approve! You were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay.<br> What the hell were you thinking? See? And you thought she'd be judgmental.<br> I wasn't in love with him.<br> I was helping out a friend.<br> When he left town, you stayed in your pajamas for a month.<br> And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.<br> Well, didn't you? I might have.<br> I can't believe you didn't tell me.<br> Like you tell me everything? What have I not told you? I don't know.<br> The fact that the underwear out on the telephone pole is yours from when you had sex with Bobby on the terrace! What? Wait a minute! Who told you? You are dead meat.<br> I didn't know it was a big secret.<br> Oh, it's not big.<br> Not at all.<br> IKind of the same as, say  I don't know, having a third nipple! You have a third nipple? You bitch! Whip it out! Whip it out! There's nothing to see! It's a tiny bump.<br> It's totally useless.<br> As opposed to your other multi-functional nipples? I can't believe you! You told me it was a nubbin.<br> Joey, what did you think a nubbin was? You see something, you hear a word, I thought that's what it was.<br> -Let me see it again! -Yes, show us your nubbin! Joey was in a porno movie! If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me! -Oh, my God! -You were in a porno?! I was young and I just wanted a job.<br> But I couldn't go through with it.<br> They let me be the guy who fixes the copier but can't because there's people having sex on it.<br> That is wild! -What's it shaped like? -ls it hairy? What happens if you flick it? So does it do anything, you know, special? Pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.<br> In some cultures, having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.<br> You get the best huts, and women dance naked around you.<br> Are any of these cultures, per chance, in the Tri-State area? You know, you are so amazing.<br> Is there anything you don't know? Julie's so smart! Julie's so special! I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did.<br> But he's with her now.<br> You'll have to get over it.<br> Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.<br> I didn't know that's what I had to do.<br> I just have to get over it.<br> -Sassy lady! -Where are you going? I'm meeting Duncan.<br> He's skating tonight at the Garden.<br> He's in the Capades.<br> -The lce Capades? -No, the Gravel Capades.<br> The turns aren't as fast, but when Snoopy falls? Funny.<br> I can't believe you'd dress up for him.<br> You're setting yourself up all over again.<br> Okay, no.<br> For your information, I'm seeing him so I can put those feelings behind me.<br> The reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.<br> Darn it, we're all out of milk.<br> Chandler, will you fill me up here? I see, I see.<br> Because of the third-nipple thing.<br> Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.<br> -See you later, Rach.<br> -Bye-bye, Julie.<br> Come on, cut it out! -Can I ask you something? -Sure.<br> What? Come on, talk to me.<br> What's the longest you've been in a relationship before  having the sex? Why? Who's not? Are you and Julie not? Are you and Julie not having sex? Technically? No.<br> Is it because she's so cold in bed? Or because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school? No! She's great.<br> And it's not like we haven't done anything.<br> We do plenty of other stuff.<br> Lots of other stuff like No! Don't need to know the details.<br> No, it's just.<br> It's me.<br> I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian.<br> So now I've got myself all psyched out.<br> It's become, like, this this thing! You must just think I'm weird.<br> No, I don't think it's weird.<br> I think, in fact.<br> -ln fact, you know what I think? -What? I think it's sexy.<br> Sexy? Let me tell you something.<br> As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.<br> No kidding? You know what I'd do? I'd wait.<br> -You'd wait? -Absolutely.<br> I would wait and wait.<br> Then I'd wait some more.<br> Really? I don't care if she tells you she wants it, she begs, she pleads she tells you she's gonna have sex with another man That just means it's working.<br> Women really want this? More than jewelry.<br> Look at you! You look great! Do l? Thank you.<br> So do you.<br> Sparkly! This is pretty wonderful, Mr.<br> Major Capades Guy! I remember when you were just King Friday in Mr.<br> Roger's Ice Is Nice.<br> You always said I'd make it.<br> Well, you know, I'm kind of spooky that way.<br> Gosh, I missed you! -I'm gonna get changed.<br> -Okay.<br> Now.<br> Oh! Right.<br> Okay.<br> Ole! What? The Matador.<br> Ole! Sweetie, can you hold this for a second? Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face.<br> But it's gone now.<br> You're all right.<br> Hi, everyone.<br> I wanted to thank you for our little talk before.<br> No problem! So you're gonna go with the waiting thing? I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.<br> Good.<br> What did he say? He told me to get over myself and just do it.<br> I thought about what you said and about what he said.<br> And his way, I get to have sex tonight, so.<br> What is this in my pocket? Why, it's Joey's porno movie! Pop it in! I'm fine, if you're okay watching a video filled with two-nippled people.<br> People having sex.<br> That's just what I need to see.<br> What's wrong with people having sex? Well, you know, these movies are offensive and degrading to women and females.<br> And the lighting's always unflattering.<br> -Monica, help me out here.<br> -Hell, I wanna see Joey! So is there a story? Or do they just start doing it right Oh.<br> Never mind.<br> Wait a minute.<br> That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.<br> All I say is, she'd better get the job.<br> Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.<br> Here I come.<br> See, I'm coming to fix the copier.<br> I can't get to the copier.<br> I'm thinking, "What do I do?" So I just watch them have sex.<br> Then I say Here's my line! You know, that's bad for the paper tray.<br> Nice work, my friend! Wait, you see me again.<br> Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.<br> There I am.<br> There I am.<br> There I am.<br> So what's up? You came to see me yesterday.<br> I kind of need a divorce.<br> O  kay.<br> How come? Actually, I'm getting married again.<br> What? I don't know how to tell you this.<br> I'm straight.<br> I don't understand.<br> How can you be straight? You're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties! That's what I kept telling myself.<br> But you reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.<br> How long have you known? I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.<br> I thought I was supposed to be something else.<br> I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay.<br> I was just trying to fit in.<br> And there's actually a woman? Her name's Debra.<br> Well, is she the first that you've been with? I've never told you this  but there were one or two times back in college when  I'd get drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me.<br> I told myself it was the liquor, and everyone experiments in college.<br> Sure.<br> Now I know I don't have a choice.<br> I was born this way! I don't know what to say.<br> You're married to someone for six years and you think you know him.<br> And then one day he says, "Oh, I'm not gay!" I'm still me.<br> Why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago? You know, it still smells like monkey in there.<br> That saves us the conversation.<br> This has been great, but I'm officially wiped.<br> Me too.<br> We should get going.<br> No! Come on, you guys! Come on, it's only 1 1 :30.<br> Let's just talk.<br> We never just hang out and talk anymore.<br> Rachel, that's all we do.<br> Maybe that's all we do.<br> What about Julie? What about Julie? You have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you.<br> I mean, who is Julie? What do you like? What don't you like? We want to know everything.<br> Well, that could take awhile.<br> So? Who here does not have the time to get to know Julie? I got the time to get to know Julie.<br> I know her pretty well.<br> Can I go? That's fine.<br> Let's start with your childhood.<br> What was that like? In a nutshell So, have you told your parents? No, but it'll be okay.<br> They're pretty cool.<br> My brother's straight, so.<br> Here you go.<br> You know what? I just have one more question.<br> If you had figured this out sooner, and I had been around do you think l would have been the one? No.<br> Don't tell me.<br> I don't think either answer would make me feel better.<br> Here.<br> I love you, Phoebe.<br> So your brother's straight, huh? Seriously.<br> and my second-grade teacher was Miss Thomas and my first-grade teacher was Mrs.<br> Cobb.<br> Mrs.<br> Gobb? No, Cobb.<br> Like cobb salad.<br> What exactly is in a cobb salad? I'm going home.<br> Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh? Good night.<br> It's pretty late.<br> You're probably not still planning on.<br> No, I am.<br> Are you nervous? I have done it before.<br> I mean, how are you gonna handle it? Are you gonna talk about it beforehand? Are you just gonna pounce? I don't know.<br> I guess I'm just gonna see what happens.<br> Good luck! What? Nothing.<br> It is your first time with her, and if the first time doesn't go well well then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.<br> Okay, now I'm nervous.<br> Maybe you should put it off.<br> No, I don't want to put it off! I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.<br> And now I'm actually happy.<br> You know, I mean really happy.<br> I just don't wanna.<br> I don't wanna mess it up, you know? I know.<br> I'm sorry.<br> It's not your fault.<br> Right.<br> Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.<br> Maybe you were on the right track with that whole "spontaneous" thing.<br> -Women really like that.<br> -Really? I mean if it were me, I'd want you to.<br> I don't know, catch me off guard with a really good kiss.<br> Really sort of soft at first.<br> And then maybe brush the hair away from my face.<br> And then look far into my eyes in a way that lets me know something amazing is about to happen.<br> And then, I don't know, then you'd pull me really close to you so that so that I'd be pressed up right against you.<br> And it would get kind of sweaty and blurry.<br> And then it's just happening.<br> Thanks, Rach.<br> Good night! Oh, God! Good morning! Well, somebody got some last night! Twice!   <br>
