                    			Mother, just once, can we go to lunch and not talk about what I'm wearing or where my career is going? Or who I'm dating.<br> -Ready for the check? -God, yes.<br> -I'll take it.<br> -No, darling.<br> I said I'll take it.<br> Here, take it.<br> Go.<br> Run.<br> Very sweet.<br> -And on what they pay you -Career.<br> You don't have to worry about me.<br> I'm doing fine.<br> I'm afraid this has been denied.<br> That's impossible.<br> That's all right, dear.<br> Here you go.<br> The One With The Fake Monica How'd someone get your card number? No idea.<br> Look how much they spent.<br> You only have to pay for the stuff you bought.<br> Still, it's just such reckless spending.<br> When somebody steals they've already thrown caution to the wind.<br> Wow, what a geek.<br> They spent $69.<br> 95 on a Wonder Mop.<br> That's me.<br> You see, when I say geek, I mean The hell with it, you bought a $70 mop, you're a geek.<br> Oh, yuck.<br> Ross, he's doing it again.<br> Marcel, stop humping the lamp.<br> Stop humping.<br> Now, Marcel, come Come here, Marcel.<br> Oh, no.<br> Not in my room.<br> I'll get him.<br> You've got to do something about that.<br> What? It's just a phase.<br> Well, that's what we said about Joey.<br> You'd think you would be more understanding.<br> I know.<br> But we're not.<br> Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.<br> -Marcel, stop it.<br> Marcel.<br> Bad monkey.<br> -What? Let's say my Curious George is no longer curious.<br> You are not still going over that thing.<br> -This woman's living my life.<br> -What? She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me.<br> Look at this.<br> Look.<br> She buys tickets to plays I wanna see.<br> She shops where I'm afraid of the salespeople.<br> -She spent $300 on art supplies.<br> -You're not an artist.<br> I might be if I had the supplies.<br> I mean, I could do all this stuff.<br> Only I don't.<br> Oh, Monica, come on.<br> You do cool things.<br> Really? Let's compare, shall we? Oh, it's so late for "shall we.<br>" Do I horseback ride in the park? -Do I take classes at the New School? -No.<br> She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.<br> -How about Joey Paponi? -No, still too ethnic.<br> -My agent wants a more neutral name.<br> -Joey Switzerland? Plus, I think it should be Joe.<br> Joey makes me sound like I'm this big: Which I'm not.<br> Joe, Joe, Joe Stalin? Stalin.<br> Do I know that name? It sounds familiar.<br> Well, it does not ring a bell with me.<br> But you're more plugged into that show business thing.<br> Joe Stalin.<br> You know, that's pretty good.<br> You might wanna try Joseph.<br> Joseph Stalin.<br> -I think you'd remember that.<br> -Yes.<br> Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin.<br> Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.<br> Hi.<br> Yes, this is Monica Geller.<br> I'm taking some classes with you, and I was wondering what they were.<br> I've had a recent head injury and certain numbers Barbecue.<br> Oh, did l? See, there you go.<br> -What are you doing? -All right, great.<br> Great.<br> Thanks a lot.<br> I'm going to tap class.<br> To dance with the woman that stole your card? To see what she looks like.<br> I'm sure her picture's up at the post office.<br> I should get to see who she is.<br> You're kind of losing it here.<br> This is becoming a weird obsession.<br> This is madness, I tell you.<br> For the love of God, Monica, don't do it.<br> Thank you.<br> -What do you think? -Lots of things.<br> -Which one is she? -May I help you? No, thanks.<br> We're just here to observe.<br> You don't observe a dance class.<br> You dance a dance class.<br> Spare shoes are over there.<br> What does she mean? I think she means "You dance a dance class.<br>" -Come on, come on, come on.<br> -Really? Do you see anybody you think could be me? Last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class.<br> -Let's not have that happen again.<br> -She could be you.<br> Let's get started.<br> Five, six.<br> Five, six, seven, eight.<br> -Okay, I'm not getting this.<br> -I'm totally getting it.<br> Do you ever feel like you're so uncoordinated? What? You click when they click.<br> All right, everyone grab a partner.<br> All right.<br> And my dead mother said you are it.<br> I'm with Rachel.<br> Great, it's gym class all over again.<br> You can come up to the front and dance with me.<br> Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare? It's okay, it's okay.<br> I'm here, I'm here.<br> I'm so sorry I'm late.<br> Okay, here I am.<br> So who's the new tense girl? -She's your partner.<br> -Hi, I'm Monica.<br> Oh, Monica.<br> Hi, I'm Mon -Nana.<br> -Monana.<br> -It's Dutch.<br> -You're kidding.<br> I spent three years in Amsterdam.<br> Pennsylvania Dutch.<br> And we're dancing.<br> Five, six, seven, eight.<br> Hi.<br> -Hey.<br> Where have you been? -I just got back from the vet.<br> She's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone? She says Marcel's humping is not a phase.<br> Apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.<br> Hey, he beat you.<br> She says, as time goes on, he's gonna start getting violent.<br> So, what does this mean? I have to give him up.<br> I can't believe it.<br> This sucks.<br> You just got him.<br> How could he be an adult already? I know.<br> One day he's this little thing and then he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.<br> Isn't there any way to keep him? No.<br> The vet said unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some monkey loving  he's just gonna get vicious.<br> I just gotta get him into a zoo.<br> -How do you get a monkey into a zoo? -I know.<br> No, that's popes into a Vokswagen.<br> We're applying to a lot.<br> Our first choice would be a big state zoo.<br> You know, like San Diego.<br> Right? But that may just be a pipe dream.<br> He's out-of-state.<br> My vet knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.<br> But that's two blocks from the beach.<br> It's a total party zoo.<br> We found the girl.<br> -Did you call the cops? -We took her to lunch.<br> Oh, your own brand of vigilante justice.<br> Are you insane? This woman stole from you.<br> She stole.<br> She's a stealer.<br> After you're with this woman for 10 minutes, you forget that.<br> I mean, she's this astounding person with this amazing spirit.<br> Which she probably stole from some cheerleader.<br> -Take off their hats.<br> -Popes in a Vokswagen.<br> I love that joke.<br> -No way.<br> No way did you do this.<br> -Monana was very brave.<br> We told them we were the Gundersons in room 61 5 only to find out the Boston Celtics had the entire floor.<br> When they saw that we're short and have breasts.<br> They threw us out.<br> I was thrown out of a hotel.<br> Me.<br> Go, Monana.<br> You ladies are not the only ones living the dream.<br> I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know.<br> Don't wait up.<br> Oh, by the way tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.<br> -Excuse me? -There's an open call for Cats.<br> I'm thinking we sing "Memories" and make complete fools of ourselves.<br> What do you say? No, no, no.<br> Remember who you're dealing with here.<br> I can't even stand in front of a tap class.<br> That's because of your Amish background.<br> -What? -You're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? Right.<br> Till I bought a blow dryer.<br> Then I was shunned.<br> I was just like you.<br> And then, one day, I saw a movie that changed my life.<br> Did you ever see Dead Poets Society? I thought that movie was so incredibly boring.<br> That thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? It's like, "Kid, wait a year.<br> Leave home, do some community theater.<br>" I thought, "That's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.<br>" That scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.<br> Wow.<br> Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs.<br> Doubtfire.<br> Oh, God.<br> We didn't get into Scranton.<br> That was, like, our safety zoo.<br> They take, like, dogs and cows.<br> See, I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.<br> I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.<br> Marcel.<br> Marcel.<br> Marcel, no.<br> Good boy.<br> See? How can nobody want him? Somebody will.<br> You know, there already is a Joseph Stalin.<br> You're kidding.<br> Apparently, he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered people.<br> -You'd think you would've known that.<br> -You'd think I would've.<br> Hey, how about Joey Heatherton? Come on, I told you I don't wanna go back to Joey.<br> What do you think a good stage name for me would be? Flame Boy.<br> Where exactly is your zoo? Well, it's technically not a zoo, per se.<br> It's more of an interactive wildlife experience.<br> Let me ask you some questions about Marcel.<br> -Does he fight with other animals? -No, no.<br> He's very docile.<br> Even if he were cornered? Well, I don't know.<br> Why? How is he at handling small objects? He can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.<br> What about a hammer or a small blade? Why would he need a blade? If he's up against an animal with horns you got to give him something.<br> Otherwise, it's just cruel.<br> -He got into San Diego.<br> -What? We came back from our walk.<br> The phone was ringing.<br> He's in.<br> Did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego.<br> San Diego.<br> You're making a mistake.<br> San Diego's good  but I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you 20% of the gate.<br> Where have you been? Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.<br> I think I kissed an archbishop.<br> But, of course, it could've been a chef.<br> -Are you drunk? -No.<br> -I'm lying.<br> I am so drunk.<br> -Oh, God.<br> You know what? You could've called.<br> I've been worried Monica.<br> Water rules.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, it does.<br> The restaurant called.<br> They wanna know if you're showing up for work.<br> Nope.<br> Going to the Big Apple Circus today.<br> You're gonna lose your job.<br> This is not you.<br> No, it is me.<br> I'm not just the person who fluffs the pillows and pays the bills right away.<br> You know, when I'm with her, I'm so much more than that.<br> I'm Monana.<br> Hello? Yes, she is.<br> Hold on a second please.<br> Monana, it's for you.<br> The credit card people.<br> Hello.<br> Yes? Oh, my God.<br> -Thanks.<br> -What? They've arrested Monica.<br> -Hi.<br> -Hi.<br> How are you? Not too bad.<br> Fortunately, blue's my color.<br> How did you know I was here? Because I'm Monica Geller.<br> It was my credit card you were using.<br> That I was not expecting.<br> I want you to know, I didn't turn you in.<br> -Thanks.<br> -No, thank you.<br> You have given me so much.<br> I'd never have gotten to sing  "Memories" at the Winter Garden Theater.<br> Actually, you only got to sing "Memo" I can't believe you're here.<br> What will I do without you? Who's gonna crash parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus? I started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women and you're worried about who'll take you to the circus? Well, not worried, you know, just wondering.<br> There's nothing to wonder about.<br> You'll go back to being who you were.<br> That's who you are.<br> -Not necessarily.<br> -Yes, necessarily.<br> I don't know what it is.<br> Maybe it's the Amish thing.<br> -I'm not actually Amish.<br> -Really? Then why are you like that? -You, by the door, in or out? -ln.<br> -You're getting it all wrong.<br> -But at least I'm doing it.<br> This is the final boarding call for Flight 67  to San Diego at gate 42A.<br> Okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.<br> All right, I wrote you this poem.<br> Okay, but don't eat it till you get on the plane.<br> Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.<br> Okay, bye, champ.<br> There'll be a lot of babes in San Diego  but remember, there's also a lot to learn.<br> I don't know what to say, Ross.<br> It's a monkey.<br> Just say what you feel, Joey.<br> -Marcel, I'm hungry.<br> -That was good.<br> Marcel, this is for you.<br> It's just, you know, something to do on the plane.<br> If you don't mind, I'd like a moment alone.<br> -Oh, sure.<br> Absolutely.<br> -Go ahead.<br> Marcel, come here.<br> Come here.<br> Come here.<br> Well, buddy this is it.<br> Just a couple of things I wanted to say.<br> I'm really gonna miss you.<br> You know, I'm never gonna forget about you.<br> You've been more than just a pet to me.<br> You've been more like a Okay.<br> Marcel.<br> Would you leave my leg alone? Would you stop humping me for two seconds? Okay, would you just take him away? Just take him.<br> Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch thy cheek.<br> -That's fine.<br> Thank you.<br> -Next.<br> I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.<br> -Name? -Holden McGroin.<br>   <br>
