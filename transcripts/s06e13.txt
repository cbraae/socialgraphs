That's on the house, courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.<br> Great.<br> Well, tell him thanks.<br> And since Joey seems like such a nice guy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>maybe we could go out? He's not used to women being so forward.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I could check with him.<br> He says it's okay.<br> Great.<br> Thanks.<br> Bye-bye.<br> How come our stuff isn't free? It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt.<br> I'm getting more dates than ever.<br> You're only giving free stuff to the pretty girls? Joey, that is so gross! How about a scone on the house, baby? I'm pretty.<br> The One With Rachel's Sister Gelula/SDI -Hey, does anyone have any gum? -I do.<br> Here.<br> Sorry.<br> Oh, you know what? No.<br> Wait a second.<br> -I know it's in here.<br> -You know what? I'm good.<br> Why are you here? Shouldn't you be at work? They sent me home.<br> They said I can't work if I'm sick.<br> -Sorry you're sick.<br> -I'm not sick! I don't get sick.<br> Getting sick is for weaklings, it's for pansies.<br> No one thinks that you're a pansy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but we do think that you need a tissue.<br> I have not been sick in over three years.<br> I'll get tissue.<br> I don't need a tissue.<br> I'm fine-d.<br> When you put a "D" at the end of fine.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you're not fine.<br> I'm fine-d.<br> I'm fine-d.<br> It's a really hard word to say.<br> -Yes? -Hi.<br> Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.<br> Oh, my God, Jill! Oh, my God, Rachel! Oh, my God, introduce us.<br> This is Chandler.<br> And you know Monica and Ross.<br> And that's Phoebe.<br> And that's Joey.<br> -How you doing? -Don't! Honey, what are you doing here? Which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her? Daddy cut me off.<br> Never mind, I got it.<br> You know what I said? I said, "I'll hire a lawyer, sue you, take all your money.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and cut you off! " Wow.<br> What did he say? That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.<br> Then he told me to learn the value of money.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>from the one daughter he's actually proud of.<br> Did you hear that? My dad's proud of me.<br> My dad's proud of me.<br> -Rach? -Oh, yeah.<br> Sorry.<br> Honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off? Okay, I bought a boat.<br> You bought a boat? It wasn't for me, it was for a friend.<br> Boy, did we make friends with the wrong sister.<br> This is the best thing that could've happened to you.<br> You've needed to get out on your own.<br> When I did it, at first I was scared, but then look at me now.<br> I am the only daughter that Dad is proud of.<br> This is what you'll do.<br> You're gonna get a job.<br> You're gonna get an apartment.<br> And you can stay with us.<br> Right, Pheebs? Of course, yeah.<br> Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this.<br> I don't know how to thank you.<br> Oh, I like cars.<br> -You all finished? -Yes.<br> Great.<br> Okay, here are the tips for this morning.<br> Jen gets 50, 50 for me and Joey owes eight dollars.<br> -What? -For all the free food you gave away.<br> If it's free, how come you're charging me for it? Don't give anything away unless it's a birthday.<br> What if they came in third in a modeling contest? No.<br> Sorry.<br> I just had the hardest day.<br> Some of these are so heavy.<br> How did you pay? I thought your dad took your credit card.<br> I memorized those numbers when I was 1 5.<br> But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater.<br> And these are my "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.<br> Charging clothes to your dad doesn't qualify as making it on your own.<br> Oh, Mr.<br> Scientist has to get all technical.<br> Rachel's not gonna think it's a good idea.<br> -So who made her queen of the world? -I would love that job! What's going on? Jill! Did you shop? No.<br> They did.<br> Yeah, we went shopping! You went shopping? Then you came here and paraded it under Jill's nose.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>when you know she's trying to quit.<br> That's terrible.<br> Sorry, Jill.<br> So what'd you get? Oh, well, all right.<br> Thank you.<br> I got this, you know, "I want a job" sweater.<br> And then I got.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> These are apartment pants.<br> Apartment pants? You never heard of them? Of course, I've heard of them.<br> Ross, what'd you get? I got this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> This.<br> -A Pashmina? -Yeah! I love these babies.<br> Really? What's a Pashmina? It's a rug.<br> Jill? I'm sorry, Rachel.<br> You think that's gonna work on me? I invented that.<br> Right! But I am sorry.<br> It's okay.<br> One little setback is okay.<br> But don't let it happen again, okay? Okay.<br> Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away.<br> But I'm just gonna take the Pashmina.<br> And the pants.<br> I'll take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.<br> Alrighty.<br> I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.<br> She took all my stuff.<br> Yeah.<br> Everything but the little blue one.<br> That's the best one! Oh, my God.<br> Thank you so much! Well, hey.<br> Oh, my gosh, that was so lame.<br> Like a Pashmina could be a rug.<br> Oh, yeah? How about you with the "I'm sorry.<br> " Shut up! I wasn't like that at all.<br> What about what I said about the apartment pants.<br> How dumb was l? -Were you this cute in high school? -Oh, stop.<br> -No, you stop.<br> -No, you stop.<br> Why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it.<br> Okay, so what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy.<br> I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.<br> Okay, I'll rest.<br> But if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.<br> See, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>drippy here.<br> Are you saying that you don't want to get with this? I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.<br> Come on.<br> Don't take this personally.<br> I just can't have sex with a sick person.<br> I'm with you.<br> I can't have sex with a sick person either.<br> Disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you.<br> We are two healthy people in the prime of life.<br> See, that's the thing, I would like to stay in the "prime of lime.<br> " What's up? I think there's something you should know.<br> It better not be about the apartment pants.<br> I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.<br> No.<br> It's just, I was.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I was with Ross and Jill after you left.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.<br> -What? -I mean, it's probably nothing.<br> But I wanted to warn you that there might be something.<br> -With Ross and Jill? -Yeah.<br> With Ross and my sister? With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross? -Oh, there is no way.<br> -Okay, then.<br> Oh, my God! I cannot believe that! I don't like it when he dates anyone, but my sister? Isn't that incest or something? And they're gonna have sex.<br> Oh, no! What if he marries her too? This is just terrible.<br> This is just terrible.<br> And I can't stop it.<br> I don't own Ross.<br> And Jill should be able to do what she wants to do.<br> Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister.<br> This is the worst thing that could've ever happened to me.<br> But great news about the apartment pants, huh? That'll be $3.<br>85.<br> What? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay.<br> It's just, I can't, because my manager said that l-- Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you -Happy birthday, dear Annie-- -Amy! --Amy Happy birthday to you That's weird, today's my birthday too.<br> Not in here it isn't.<br> Sorry I'm late.<br> What's up? I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.<br> No.<br> But I walked past three sales and didn't go in.<br> How strong am l? That is great.<br> You know who doesn't have to job-hunt? Ross.<br> -He works at the university.<br> -Yeah? So you guys talked? So you get along? So you're gonna go out? Me go out with Ross? No.<br> God, no.<br> What would make you think that? Phoebe.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>said she thought she saw something between you guys.<br> I mean, he's nice.<br> He's the kind you're friends with, but not the kind you date.<br> He's the kind you date, because you did.<br> But me? Not so much.<br> Oh, not so much? What do you mean? ls there something wrong with Ross? No, no, no.<br> He's just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I don't know.<br> You know, he's just a little bookish.<br> Are you saying he's a geek? You think so too? No.<br> Ross is not a geek.<br> Then let's just say he's not my type.<br> Handsome is not your type? Smart, kind, good kisser.<br> What, those things aren't on your list? Ross is great.<br> You'd be lucky to be with him.<br> If it means that much, then I'll ask him out.<br> Oh, no.<br> That's not what I meant.<br> You know what? You're right.<br> He has been really nice to me.<br> Yeah, but he's not your type.<br> But maybe that's good.<br> I'm doing all these different things.<br> Maybe I should just try dating a geek too.<br> Yeah, but you don't want to try too much too fast.<br> You remember what happened to the little girl who.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>tried too much too fast, don't you? What? She died, Jill.<br> Chandler! What is it, honey? You need some tea? Some soup? Calling Dr.<br> Big.<br> Dr.<br> Big to the bed.<br> Geez, honey, I thought you were asleep.<br> How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room? I was asleep.<br> No, honey.<br> You know what's sexy? Layers.<br> Layers are sexy.<br> And blankets are sexy.<br> And hot water bottles are sexy.<br> Get into bed.<br> I want to prove I'm not sick.<br> I want to make you feel as good as I feel.<br> Would you please get some rest? I'm fine.<br> Happy birthday to you -You're paying for that.<br> -No, it's her birthday.<br> You've sung "Happy Birthday" to 20 women today.<br> You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.<br> Damn it! Did you tell your sister to ask me out? -Well, yeah.<br> -Oh, wow! I mean, wow.<br> I think she's cute, but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I never would've thought of going out with her.<br> Never! Really? But after your okay, I figured, "Why not?" Oh, so not really "never.<br> " I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am.<br> I mean, after all we've been through.<br> I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.<br> If you ever date Monica, you have my blessing.<br> And mine.<br> Chandler? I think I'm sick.<br> Really? Struck down in the "pribe of libe.<br> " Okay, fine, I admit it.<br> I feel terrible.<br> Will you please rub this on my chest? No, no, no.<br> You are not getting me this way.<br> Come on, I really need your help here.<br> -Fine, I'll rub it on myself.<br> -Okay.<br> So you're just kind of rubbing it on yourself? -Yeah.<br> -It's nice.<br> You kidding me? ls this turning you on? Yes.<br> Is it the rubbing or the smell? It's all very, very good.<br> So, you want to go.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>mix it up? -Not now, I'm sick.<br> -Oh, come on, you big faker! What about never sleeping with sick people? Well, that was before all the vaporizing action.<br> Okay, if you really want to have sex.<br> Worked like a charm.<br> Why are you here? This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date.<br> So, what do you think? I don't like it.<br> -Really? -It's kind of slutty.<br> It's yours.<br> Yeah, well, I'm a slut.<br> Me too.<br> Hi, Jill.<br> Hi.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Rachel.<br> You're not at home, you're right here.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> And I bet you thought it would be weird.<br> But it's not.<br> Okay.<br> So, well, I'll.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I'll have her home by midnight.<br> Why aren't you home yet? Is someone there? Oh, yeah, it's me.<br> Sorry.<br> What are you doing here? I'm just looking out your window.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>at the view.<br> What are you guys doing? We got some Vapor Rub in some places.<br> He brought her back to his apartment.<br> Who? Is that your sister? She is a slut! Ross is on a date with your sister.<br> How weird is that? Oh, my God, he's taking off her clothes! He's taking off her coat.<br> Oh, this is just terrible.<br> Oh, no, it's not.<br> It's a first date.<br> I'm sure that nothing is gonna.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> He's gonna get some.<br> Of the glare.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>from the streetlight out of his apartment.<br> You know, so he's closed the drapes there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so he can have a nice, pleasant.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>conversation with your little sister.<br> Well, I'm off to bed.<br>   <br>
