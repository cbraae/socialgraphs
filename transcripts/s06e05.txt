                    			I cannot believe that you didn't tell me we are still married! Look, I was going to tell you.<br> When? After the birth of our first secret child? Ross didn't get the annulment.<br> We are still married! -You're kidding? -Oh, my God! It wasn't my best decision, but I couldn't face another failed marriage.<br> At what point did you think this was a successful marriage? Rach, come on.<br> If you think about it, it's actually kind of funny.<br> Maybe it's best not to think about it.<br> This is inexcusable.<br> I'm shocked to my very core.<br> Phoebe, I told her you already knew.<br> Another lie.<br> You have a sickness! For my own peace of mind, are you married to any more of us? The One With Joey's Porshe Gelula/SDI Someone left their keys.<br> To a Porsche.<br> -Are these yours? -Yeah.<br> That's what I drive.<br> I make 4 bucks an hour.<br> I saved up for 350 years.<br> Did anybody lose their keys? Put them in the lost and found.<br> There's a lost and found? My shoe! You left a shoe here? I didn't realize till I got home.<br> I wasn't gonna walk back with one shoe.<br> I'll go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.<br> When he comes back for his keys, I'll give him your shoe.<br> Great.<br> Thanks.<br> Oh, good.<br> You guys are here.<br> Listen.<br> How would you like to spend tomorrow taking care of three cute puppies? My, God! What a fun day! Sounds great! Yeah, all right.<br> I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.<br> By the way, they're not actually puppies.<br> They're Frank and Alice's triplets.<br> See you.<br> What? Please, please, please? Frank and Alice.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>asked me to babysit them.<br> I'm nervous.<br> I've never done that.<br> Don't worry.<br> We'll do it.<br> I'm gonna pass, because I was kind of iffy when it was puppies.<br> Come on, Chandler.<br> It'll give us great practice for when.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>people with babies come to visit.<br> Nice car.<br> It's not mine.<br> -I love your car.<br> -Yeah.<br> It's mine.<br> -I bet it's fast.<br> -Me too.<br> Yeah.<br> And comfortable.<br> -You like leather seats? -Yeah.<br> It's got them! So I still have boxes here.<br> I still have boxes at Ross' .<br> And I have nowhere to live.<br> I could so easily freak out right now.<br> What about me? Denise is leaving town for a while.<br> I don't have a roommate.<br> Well, maybe I could be your roommate, Pheebs.<br> Maybe you could be my roommate! Well, there's an idea! That would be great! -How long is Denise gone for? -She said she'd be back December 26th.<br> December 26th.<br> Maybe she's Santa Claus.<br> Oh, look who it is.<br> My husband, the apple of my eye.<br> Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I picked up all the forms.<br> I'll take care of it.<br> Sure, if you say you'll take care of it, I have no reason to doubt you.<br> Give me those forms.<br> I'm gonna do this my way, and I don't wanna hear a peep out of you.<br> -Okay, Rach, but-- -You're peeping! Ross, I just got-- -Why did you do this? -I told you-- I don't wanna hear "three failed marriages.<br> " If you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand.<br> Thanks to you, I'm halfway there.<br> Oh, I am so mad, Ross! I don't think I've ever been this angry! What about when I said we were on a break? Pheebs, how's it going? I'm okay.<br> Are they having fun? Am I talking too fast? No.<br> You sound like me.<br> It's going great.<br> Look at Chandler with Little Baby Girl Chandler.<br> Little Baby Girl Chandler.<br> Where have I heard that before? Oh, Coach Rubin.<br> Pheebs, when you're done over there, we've got a situation over here too.<br> No.<br> We are all responsible for our own babies.<br> That's where you're wrong.<br> We've been playing them man-to-man.<br> We should really be playing a zone defense.<br> What do you mean? Things'll go smoother if we each have a zone.<br> Phoebe, be in charge of wiping.<br> Mon, be in charge of diapering.<br> I'll be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Sounds great, but you should be in charge of wiping.<br> Okay, I'm a rookie.<br> I should not be in the end zone.<br> This is so great.<br> This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.<br> Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.<br> Hey, guys.<br> Hey, babies.<br> I'm having the best morning.<br> That Porsche I've got the keys to? Still there.<br> Shocking, since you still have the keys.<br> You should see the treatment I get with that car.<br> People are friendly.<br> They wanna talk.<br> And not just about the car.<br> One guy advised me on my equity investments.<br> What equity investments? The ones that got me the Porsche.<br> Will you keep up? If people see me just standing there, they're gonna think I don't own it.<br> So I figure I'll wash it.<br> Monica, you got a bucket and soap? Oh, yeah.<br> I got soap and sponges and rags.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and carnauba wax and polishing compound.<br> You don't even have a car.<br> I know.<br> Once there was a dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.<br> -And? -And six others.<br> There you are.<br> Yeah, she tops out at 1 30.<br> That's just in the city.<br> I get her up to 1 60 upstate.<br> Really? You got a place upstate? Sure.<br> -All right.<br> See you later.<br> -Okay.<br> Take it easy.<br> Hey.<br> That's my car.<br> Really? Just give me five more minutes.<br> What are you doing? I found the keys, and now I'm just polishing her up.<br> -But it's my car.<br> -Yeah, but it's my wax.<br> Listen, I don't come to the city much.<br> I don't know if you're crazy or if this is some street theater.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but could I have my keys? Sure.<br> Yeah.<br> I'll save your parking spot.<br> I'm not coming back.<br> -Why not? -I live upstate.<br> Yeah, so did l.<br> I don't know why I was so nervous.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and why Frank and Alice complain.<br> This is easy.<br> Yeah, two hours, a lifetime, that's the same.<br> Check it out! When the babies wake up.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they can meet Krog! That thing could put someone's eye out.<br> He can do more than that.<br> He can destroy the universe.<br> They could swallow one of those little parts.<br> Also, look at his smooth area.<br> That's just gonna mess them up.<br> They won't swallow anything.<br> You're too overprotective.<br> When I was a kid, my mom used to throw me into a pile of broken glass.<br> -What? -Glass, sand, whatever.<br> Look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.<br> Oh, it's so cute.<br> I wonder when you stop putting both legs behind your head.<br> I can still do that.<br> How are you still single? I thought about it, and maybe you're right.<br> Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.<br> -What made you change your mind? -I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.<br> How did that happen? I was trying to prove that I was right.<br> And it turns out I was wrong.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and now it's lodged in my throat.<br> This whole time we were concentrating on the babies.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and no one was watching Chandler! You are asking the court for an annulment? Yes, Your Honor.<br> Here are our forms, all filled out.<br> So based on your petition.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you are seeking an annulment on the grounds.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that "Mr.<br> Geller is mentally unstable.<br> " Fine.<br> I'm mentally unstable.<br> And based on the fact that "Mr.<br> Geller is an intravenous drug user.<br> " -What? -Yes.<br> Heroin and crack.<br> Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.<br> Well, you would know.<br> Now, it also says here that you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> "Iied about your sexual preference before marriage.<br> " Oh, come on.<br> Ross, please.<br> I found the magazines.<br> And, finally, that you were "unable to consummate the marriage.<br> " Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.<br> You know, I'm sorry, this is insane.<br> I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>with my ability to consummate anything.<br> I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now! That won't be necessary.<br> And when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies.<br> If you were involved in a serious relationship, that creates a problem.<br> Rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.<br> Strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.<br> Is there anything in this record that is actually true? Well, yes.<br> We got married in Vegas.<br> And the names, I think.<br> Based on what I've heard, you certainly don't qualify for an annulment.<br> If you don't wanna be together, file for divorce.<br> That's great.<br> You happy? Look what you did with your funny, funny form.<br> What? Me? What about you and your "consummated like bunnies" nonsense? And what-- What are you typing that for? She said we don't get the annulment.<br> Don't type that.<br> What-- Stop typing! Stop typing! "Stop typing, stop typing! " Okay, do you see what you're keeping me married to? Get out of my chambers.<br> Lady, here's the deal.<br> I came here for an annulment, and I'm not leaving here until I get one! -Would you like a night in jail? -Thank you for your time.<br> That Porsche guy took his car back.<br> But you found the keys to his clothes? No, I just love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.<br> They'll think you own one because of the clothes? Of course.<br> Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.<br> That is true.<br> Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.<br> Oh, I've been there.<br> I am gonna go drive my Porsche.<br> You know you don't actually have one.<br> What are you doing? I'm in character.<br> Will you talk to her? I think it just moved.<br> It's poking me.<br> We'll go to the emergency room.<br> No, you can't leave me here with them.<br> We're babysitting.<br> The babies are asleep.<br> You'll be okay on your own.<br> You can't leave me with them.<br> We're a team.<br> We're playing a zone.<br> They'll triple-team me! He's got plastic in his throat.<br> We gotta go to the hospital.<br> But a doctor won't be able to help him.<br> And it's just gonna.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>naturally pass through his system in seven years.<br> -I think that's gum.<br> -I'm pretty sure it's gun.<br> This really hurts.<br> Let's go.<br> But no! A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.<br> No! What would Krog do? Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche? Maybe because you've got the keys? -That was totally your fault.<br> -My fault? You threatened the judge.<br> You ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine! That was the only way I could get him to stop typing! Hi.<br> How are the Gellers? Don't call us that.<br> The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment.<br> Now we gotta get a divorce! Did a Porsche throw up on you? It's "Porsche-a" ! Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe, right? I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a "Yeah, I do! " Let's get rid of this dirty diaper.<br> I'll set you up with a clean one.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to scare you.<br> I just have to clean that up.<br> Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.<br> I broke it.<br> All right.<br> Well, that's just the way things go.<br> Okay.<br> Good.<br> Why are there only two of you? Where's Leslie? Well, you can't answer.<br> Leslie? Where are you, Leslie? Now would be a good time for your first words.<br> Well, look at you! You are a little bit mischievous.<br> My gosh! Oh, you're a lot mischievous.<br> Well, it'll dry.<br> You sit with your brother and sister now.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who aren't there.<br> How do you feel? Let's just say, Krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in 1 2 to 1 4 hours.<br> I totally took care of the babies all by myself.<br> I fed them, bathed them and put them to bed.<br> And protected them from a tornado? Oh, my God! I know.<br> The babies are asleep.<br> Phoebe, what happened here? I did it.<br> I took care of the babies all by myself.<br> -But my apartment! -Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.<br> But the mess! Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies.<br> You're right.<br> I shouldn't freak out.<br> This is what it'll be like when we have babies.<br> When's that? Phoebe, look at this mess! Honey, thank God you're home.<br> I was getting worried.<br> I picked up the divorce papers.<br> I've already signed everything.<br> I put little X's where you need to sign.<br> Little X's.<br> Great! That makes up for everything.<br> You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too, okay? Name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one.<br> How about you flew to London to stop my wedding? You told me you loved me after I was married.<br> Wait, that was different.<br> I did those things because I was in love with you.<br> Right.<br> You're right.<br> That's very different.<br> So let's just sign the papers.<br> What? Nothing.<br> Okay, can we just sign, please? Congratulations.<br> Okay, wait, Ross.<br> Wait a minute.<br> I kind of have a little confession.<br> What? Well, you know, this whole marriage thing.<br> Kind of my idea.<br> Excuse me? Remember how we were too drunk to remember anything when we were married? I didn't really wanna say anything, but it just kept coming back to me.<br> We were in the casino, and you thought it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.<br> And I thought it would be funnier if we got married.<br> So, as a compromise, we decided first to get married and then.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to eat a lot of grapes.<br> Sorry I got us into this whole thing.<br> So then if you think about it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>this is all your fault.<br> Yeah, don't push it, though.<br> I gotta say.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I know I divorce a lot of women.<br> Never thought I'd be divorcing you.<br> I know.<br> I always thought if we got married, that'd be the one that stuck.<br> And it wouldn't be a secret.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.<br> Did I even treat? No, it was on the house.<br> It was a newlywed special.<br> That may be the most depressing thing I've heard.<br> I should get these to my lawyer's office.<br> Thanks for taking care of all this.<br> No problem.<br> -I'm gonna need a copy of those.<br> -Totally.<br> Careful around my Porsche! Hi, Joey.<br> Hey.<br> How you doing? He has the most amazing Porsche under there.<br> I'd show you, but I just tucked her in.<br> She's sleeping.<br> Would you like to go for a drink?   <br>
