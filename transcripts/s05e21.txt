                    			I'll get coffee.<br> Want anything, baby doll? I'm fine.<br> Thanks.<br> I can't pull off "baby doll," can l? No, I think we learned that from the "sugar lips" incident.<br> I'll make some tea.<br> How you doing, pumpkin? -So it's going well for you two? -I know.<br> Really well.<br> I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.<br> What do you think? It's great! When will you ask her? Tonight.<br> But don't say anything.<br> I swear.<br> I promise.<br> I'm so excited! But listen, do not get her flowers, okay? Because she cries when they die.<br> Then there's the whole funeral.<br> -I'll see you after work, sweetie.<br> -Okay.<br> Bye.<br> So, what movie should we see? Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him! What? Really? He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer! I can't believe this.<br> Right? Because it's fast.<br> Because it's so fast.<br> It's fast.<br> Relax.<br> It's Phoebe, not you.<br> Good for you, Phoebe.<br> Way to go.<br> No, but it is fast, isn't it? -I like him, but I'm not ready.<br> -So, what are you gonna do? I don't know.<br> I'll just handle it.<br> I'll ask you to talk to him! Me? Why me? Because you are so afraid of commitment.<br> You talk to him.<br> Make him scared like you, make him a man.<br> I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it'd do.<br> I'm less afraid of commitment than I used to be.<br> That is so sweet.<br> Still terrified.<br> I'll take care of it.<br> The One With the Ball Hey, Ross, is Staten lsland really an island? That's why they call it Staten "lsland.<br>" Oh, I thought it was like Long lsland.<br> Also an island.<br> -What time is it? -2:17.<br> We haven't dropped this ball for an hour.<br> Are you serious? I realized it a half-hour ago, but I didn't say anything.<br> I didn't wanna jinx it.<br> We are pretty good at this.<br> We totally forgot about lunch.<br> That's the first time I've ever missed a meal.<br> I think my pants are a little loose.<br> Hey, you guys.<br> Is Monica here? I bought something.<br> I'm not sure she'll like it.<br> It may seem crazy, but I've wanted this since I was a little girl.<br> You bought Shaun Cassidy! No.<br> I wish! Okay, you ready? Check it out.<br> What is it? What the hell is that? It's a cat.<br> That is not a cat! Yes, it is! Why is it inside out? Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat.<br> How much did you pay for that? It was extravagant, but I got a good deal.<br> -How much? -Thousand bucks.<br> On a cat? It's not a cat! For a thousand dollars, you'd think at least it'd come with hair.<br> Or something.<br> All right.<br> Listen, ball boys.<br> My grandma had one when I was little.<br> It was the sweetest thing.<br> It would sit in my lap and just purr all day long.<br> I would drag a string and it would chase it.<br> Free cats do that too, you know.<br> It's not a cat! I'm really excited about this, okay? I don't care what you think.<br> I'm gonna set up a litter box for Mrs.<br> Whiskerson.<br> What am I gonna call her? Fluffy? Do you wanna get something to eat, or see how long we can throw this ball? The ball thing.<br> Wouldn't it be great if we could go for two hours without dropping it? Yeah, it would! Let's do it.<br> I have to pee.<br> And Rachel's in the bathroom! Man, I didn't think we'd make it.<br> I know.<br> Don't switch hands, okay? Hey, ladies.<br> What are you in here for? What are you doing here? I am here to report a crime.<br> It's a crime that we don't spend time together.<br> What's up? You're thinking about moving in with Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.<br> You know, man to well, me.<br> Sure, okay.<br> Are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be living together.<br> I considered that.<br> It'd make me happy.<br> -You mean scared.<br> -No, I mean happy.<br> Scared happy.<br> What are you doing? I'm trying to open your eyes! If you live with Phoebe, she is always gonna be there.<br> You get home, she's there.<br> You go to bed, she's there.<br> You wake up and, oh, yes, she's there.<br> I know.<br> I can't wait! Were your parents happy or something? I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love.<br> I just want to be around her as much as I can.<br> When you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.<br> You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I think I do.<br> You know what? Move in with her.<br> Move in right now.<br> Maybe I'll move in with Monica.<br> No, it's too soon for you guys.<br> You're right about that.<br> When they found the remains of the Mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.<br> How did it get there? Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.<br> Hey, guys.<br> I left my watch here last night.<br> -lt was here.<br> Where is it? -I don't know.<br> I'm late for work.<br> How do you know? You don't have a watch.<br> Can you stop throwing the ball for one minute and help me find it? Oh, I don't know.<br> Yeah, can't do it.<br> -What? -Do not drop that ball.<br> We haven't dropped it in.<br> Two hours, 27 minutes.<br> Really? I won't make it in to work today.<br> I don't feel very good.<br> For a second, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.<br> Hey, Rach.<br> Check it out.<br> Almost three hours without dropping it.<br> Congratulations.<br> That's quite a waste of time.<br> You have scratches all over you.<br> Well, it's my cat.<br> -Oh, I got a cat.<br> -I don't want a cat! Don't worry, it's not a cat.<br> You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.<br> It's not sweet.<br> It's not cute.<br> I dragged a string, and it flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.<br> I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!" Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.<br> You paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me $300? Well, I was gonna let you play with it.<br> Did you talk to Gary about moving in? I think you should do it.<br> He's a great guy and he loves you a lot.<br> You are a very lucky lady.<br> You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do and you can't even do that right! Sorry.<br> If he asked me, I'd move in with him.<br> Get out of here, good-for-nothing.<br> Hey, Chandler.<br> Hey, Gar.<br> Hey, sweetie.<br> Can I talk to you for a second? You look pretty today.<br> Thanks.<br> Okay.<br> Here's the thing.<br> I really want this relationship to move forward.<br> If you're not moving forward, you're moving backwards.<br> No, if you're not moving forward, you're staying still.<br> And staying still is good.<br> Watch this.<br> I want you to move in with me.<br> That is so sweet.<br> But don't you think it's too soon? There's so much we don't know about each other.<br> Okay.<br> I get it.<br> I don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for.<br> I don't want to mess up what we have.<br> I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.<br> Which is why my answer is yes! Really? You're so happy.<br> Monica, stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team! You guys have been doing this for four hours? That's right, baby.<br> -All right.<br> Let me in.<br> -No, no! Don't do it! What? He's a dropper.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> That's right! I'm not a dropper! It's really a three-person game, you know? It's throwing and catching.<br> All right.<br> Oh, it's so hard.<br> Don't worry, guys.<br> It's not a cat.<br> Oh, good God! I give up.<br> I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing.<br> Baking it didn't help? Take it back to where you got it.<br> I tried.<br> They won't take her back.<br> Maybe that's because she's a minion of the Antichrist.<br> Why won't they take it? They said they would only give me store credit.<br> What am I gonna do? Get 1000 regular cats? You said it was a show cat.<br> Why don't you show it, win some prize money.<br> Those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter, and all you win are these ribbons which technically belong to the damn cat.<br> You can keep it until you find out what to do with it.<br> That's not the point.<br> I'm out $1000 I'm all scratched up and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! Oh, my God! The cat's made my eyes water.<br> Don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised! Oh, God! Okay.<br> It's okay.<br> Man, that was close.<br> Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.<br> -We have great news.<br> -We're moving in together.<br> Yay! Congratulations.<br> -I'm so excited! -So am l.<br> You're not more excited than I am.<br> No way.<br> I'm the most excited.<br> See you at the station later.<br> I'll see you later.<br> Don't forget about the moving-in! So you're moving in with him? I couldn't tell him no.<br> He got so sad.<br> Maybe it'll be all right.<br> I do like him a lot and probably do it eventually, anyway.<br> Plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.<br> Do you write him a lot? I heard when people live together they split the cost of stamps, don't they? -Yeah, yeah.<br> -That's right.<br> Sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.<br> Hey, honey.<br> Did you find any apartments in Brooklyn Heights? No, nothing.<br> -Oh, really? -Yeah.<br> -Nothing at all? -No.<br> If something opens up, we'll move in.<br> If it has a pool.<br> I need a pool.<br> Can I talk to you? Take a seat.<br> You okay? You feel all right? I feel great, because we're moving in together.<br> So you.<br> You checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You checked the Post? Yeah, there was nothing.<br> -Can I get some water? -ln a minute.<br> You checked today's Post? Yeah, today's.<br> Because this is today's Post.<br> And these are the listings I found.<br> Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.<br> Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.<br> Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights! Oh, are these for rent? I thought people were just bragging.<br> Let me tell you what's going on here.<br> Don't look at the table.<br> Look at me.<br> Somebody asked someone to move in with him.<br> Someone said yes, but now she has doubts because things are moving too fast.<br> Does that sound possible? Yes, fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! I'm sorry! It's okay that you feel this way.<br> It is soon, and there's things we don't know about each other.<br> Everything I know about you, I really like.<br> Things I don't know, I'll learn in a place with our names on the mailbox.<br> That's so sweet.<br> But if it's too soon for you, we don't have to do it.<br> I want you to be happy.<br> Living with you would make me happy.<br> You don't have to say that.<br> I want to live with you.<br> I want to move in with you.<br> Are you sure? Definitely, yes! Let's live in an apartment we both live in.<br> Oh, that's great.<br> Oh, wait, one sec.<br> Hey, you! Behind the glass.<br> Who are you looking at? I always wanted to say that every time I was in these rooms, which was never.<br> Show cat! Quality show cat! -Show cat! -Oh, my God! What's wrong with your baby? That's not a baby.<br> That's a cat.<br> -It's creepy-looking.<br> -Oh, no.<br> It's actually very sweet.<br> It's very sweet.<br> Look.<br> Yeah.<br> Do you want it? No, I hate cats.<br> Then what are you doing to me? Get out of here, all right? Move on! What an unusual cat.<br> Yes, thank you! Exactly.<br> You want it? Maybe.<br> I was thinking about getting a cat from the shelter, but.<br> -Okay.<br> Why not? -Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.<br> -What? -Okay, 1000.<br> Didn't you want me to adopt your cat? I do, but you'll have to look at this as more of an investment than a cat.<br> Okay, yeah.<br> I just wanted a cat.<br> Obviously, you know how to haggle, so I won't try and take you on.<br> So $800, and I don't call the cops, because you are robbing me blind! Blind! Just take the cat.<br> Leave the money.<br> Run away! Run away.<br> Damn it! Can't you at least smile or something? Did anybody just hear that? Anybody? -I'm starving.<br> -Come on, guys.<br> Suck it up! We're closing in on 10 hours.<br> It's gut-check time! I don't know who made you the boss.<br> We invented this game.<br> I made this game what it is! Not fun anymore? I'm still hungry.<br> There's pizza at my place.<br> We can eat with one hand.<br> Are you with me? -I am.<br> -All right, let's go! Come on! Let's go, Team Monica! We can work out the name later.<br> What is your cat doing in my bowl? I'm defrosting a chicken.<br> I sold Mrs.<br> Whiskerson.<br> Thank God! -Get your money back? -Yeah, $1500.<br> You made a profit? I just came for the red velvet pillow.<br> -There you go.<br> -Thanks, Rachel.<br> Don't forget, you can come visit her anytime.<br> Oh, good.<br> Great.<br> I'll keep that in mind.<br> So is this some kind of snake or something? I like waking up with you.<br> I like waking up with you too.<br> Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.<br> I could stay here all day.<br> That would be great.<br> -We could have breakfast in bed.<br> -Wait, just a second.<br> Oh, no.<br> All right.<br> Come on, Monica! Look alive.<br> Come on! Oh, I was having the best dream.<br> -What? -I dreamed I was drowning and not throwing this ball.<br> Oh, good.<br> You're all up.<br> It's 6:00 in the morning.<br> Why aren't you at Gary's? Oh, yeah.<br> That's over.<br> Gary's such a great guy.<br> You can work it out.<br> -He shot a bird.<br> -That is over.<br> -I'm sorry.<br> -That's terrible.<br> Are you okay? I'll be all right.<br> Here, Phoebe.<br> I don't feel like playing.<br> It's okay.<br> It's okay.<br> It didn't happen.<br> No one needs to know.<br> She's not an official ball player.<br> Only official ball players can drop the ball.<br> -Come on.<br> -Let's go.<br> You wanna get breakfast? Okay, let's race! First one there wins.<br> You guys wanna eat here? That was great, huh? Can you believe how long we threw it? It is amazing it lasted that long.<br> My arm is killing me.<br> No, I meant with the dropper over here.<br> How did I get this reputation as a dropper? I am anything but a dropper.<br> Ross!   <br>
