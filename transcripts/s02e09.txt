Ice? Ice? Ice squares anyone? Take a napkin.<br> Monica! Your guests are turning into jerky.<br> Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.<br> Hey! Get in line, buddy.<br> I was next.<br> Mr.<br> Treeger.<br> You said there was a party.<br> Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.<br> Is it hot?

Excuse me.<br> I'm seizing.<br> Mr.<br> Treeger? Here's another 50.<br> Happy Hanukkah.<br> Will this help with the knob-getting? No, the place is not open till Tuesday.<br> Am I not saying it right? So you really did like my cookies? Yeah, they were so personal.<br> It really showed you cared.<br> Nice seizing gel boy.<br> Is this mistletoe? No, that.<br> That is basil.<br> If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.<br> No, it's still basil.<br> Chestnuts roasting on an open fire Jack Frost nipping at your nose -How far did you get? -Mailbox.<br> All right, we're getting closer.<br> What's going on? It's just like a whole mess of stuff.<br> Like yesterday, my dad was this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.<br> And you know, now he's a pharmacist guy and.<br> Well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.<br> Yeah, maybe! And I'll knock on the door and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad! I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me  because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.<br> So why not go knock? Because, I mean, what if he's not this great-dad guy? What if he's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week.<br> I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.<br> Pheebs, that's okay.<br> You took a big step today.<br> Someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.<br> And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.<br> You guys.<br> Sorry about your shopping.<br> Oh, that's okay.<br> We'll figure something out.<br> I know you're not going in there  but you think it's okay if I go in and use his bathroom? That's fine, never mind.<br> Cool, snow! Kind of like a blank canvas.<br> Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here! You mind if I turn the heat down? We could have used that kind of thinking earlier! So, Pheebs, how did it go? Oh, I couldn't go in.<br> -Honey, I'm sorry.<br> -Are you okay? Yeah, it's okay, because I know he's there.<br> So that's enough for now.<br> Hey, it's after midnight! Merry Christmas, everyone! Oh, right! Merry Christmas! The knob was broken so I turned it off from underneath.<br> I hope that's all right.<br> Rach, these are for you.<br> Wiper blades! I don't even have a car.<br> No, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do! Okay, Pheebs, your turn.<br> Toilet-seat covers! Is that what you did while I got gas? You guys! And for Ross  Mr.<br> Sweet Tooth.<br> You got me a cola drink? And a lemon-lime! Well, this is too much! I feel like I should get you another sweater.<br> And last, but not least.<br> They're ribbed for your pleasure!   <br>
