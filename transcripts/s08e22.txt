Because I'll do it.<br> - What are you doing here? - They sent me home from work.<br> They said, "Start your maternity leave now.<br> Just rest.<br>" You know what? Screw them! If they don't want me there, I'll hang out with you guys.<br> Or you could do volunteer work.<br> - Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.<br> I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.<br> - You told me I could have six tickets.<br> - I sold four on eBay.<br> You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.<br> So that's it? I only get to bring one guest? Yeah.<br> What time do you want to pick me up? Hello? You hear that? I only get one extra ticket.<br> So somehow I have to pick between you three and Ross.<br> - What about me? - You said you didn't want to go.<br> I would still like to be acknowledged.<br> - Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible? - Definitely not invisible.<br> Ross didn't care enough to be here, so he's out.<br> - You snooze, you lose.<br> - He's not snoozing.<br> He's teaching.<br> Well, then somebody's snoozing.<br> And, Joey, not that this should affect you at all, but if you pick me I was planning on wearing a sequin dress cut down to here.<br> - I haven't seen this dress.<br> - Star in a movie.<br> Pick whoever you want.<br> Listen to your heart.<br> What does it tell you? Phoebe.<br> Phoebe.<br> Phoebe.<br> Well I think I want to take Chandler.<br> Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.<br> - You want to take me? - Yeah, I wish I could take everybody.<br> But Chandler's always supported my career.<br> He's paid for acting classes, headshots and stuff.<br> This will be my way of paying you back.<br> So you're never actually going to pay me back? Just because he paid for your headshots, you're gonna take him? I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is.<br> It's not just the stuff he paid for.<br> It's everything, you know? He read lines with me.<br> He went with me on auditions.<br> Then he consoled me after I didn't get parts.<br> You always believed in me, man, even when I didn't.<br> I always knew you were gonna make it.<br> I'm so proud of you.<br> Thanks, that means a lot to me.<br> Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.<br> - I'm gonna go shave.<br> - Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.<br> I have to pee.<br> If I don't come out, it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.<br> You hold her nose, I'll blow in her mouth and the kid'll just out of her.<br> She's a week late.<br> She's got to have it today.<br> I don't know.<br> I think it's still gonna be a while.<br> Care to make it interesting? - I bet you she'll have it tomorrow.<br> - You're on.<br> - Okay, how much? - One hundred thousand dollars.<br> - How about 50 bucks? - I'll call Zurich and move some money.<br> All right, whose turn is it to help me get up? No one's here.<br> Oh, damn it! This is exciting.<br> So glamorous! People taking our picture.<br> How do I look? - A little tall.<br> - What? Would you crouch down a bit so that I look taller? There you go.<br> It's just so glamorous.<br> Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.<br> And you're still pregnant.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I know how uncomfortable you are.<br> You know what? You look great.<br> Yeah, like 50 bucks.<br> I have to go pee.<br> Apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.<br> Damn it.<br> Here's your 50 bucks.<br> That's interesting that you lost.<br> Now, I forget, do you like to lose? All right, stop it.<br> - Double or nothing she has it tomorrow.<br> - Fine.<br> Until then, General Grant, why don't you set up camp right there? - Rachel here? We have an appointment.<br> - In the bathroom.<br> - Rach, we gotta go.<br> - In a minute! People ask why we're not together.<br> I just don't know what to tell them.<br> - All right, let's go.<br> - Do you want to go change first? The doctor's staying open late for us, but if you hurry - No, I'm fine.<br> - You don't think that's inappropriate? - What? - Good God, man.<br> Don't anger it.<br> Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.<br> For the first time in weeks, I am Fine.<br> Whatever you want.<br> You're the mommy.<br> No! Don't call me "Mommy.<br>" It's bad enough you call your own mother that.<br> I'm actually with her on this one.<br> I thought I knew who the enemy was Okay, this is it.<br> This is my big fight scene coming up.<br> I'm fighting for every man in the 82nd Ground Division.<br> Ross? Can I ask you something? When Carol was pregnant with Ben were you this irritating? - Excuse me? - Nothing.<br> You're just You've been a little short with me lately.<br> I'm not trying to irritate you.<br> Well, then, you must have a natural talent for it.<br> The doctor will be in soon.<br> Why don't we not speak until then? Seriously.<br> Breathe louder, Ross.<br> That's great.<br> We should ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that's half human, half pure evil! - Hi, Dr.<br> Long.<br> How are you? - You're nice to her.<br> She has the drugs.<br> We'll do a quick check.<br> Eight days late, huh? You must be getting uncomfortable.<br> Yeah, just a tad.<br> You're 80%"%" effaced.<br> You're on your way.<br> It still could last a while.<br> - There are ways to help things along.<br> - Do them! Actually, they're things you can do.<br> Home remedies.<br> In my experience, I've found some are very effective.<br> - Well, we are ready to try anything.<br> - There's an herbal tea you can drink.<br> You can take some castor oil.<br> There's spicy foods.<br> We will do all of those.<br> - Taking a long walk.<br> - Good.<br> Done.<br> And there's the one that's proved most effective: Sex.<br> You've got to be kidding me! Good job, Joe! Well done! Top-notch! - You liked it? You really liked it? - Oh, yeah! - Well, which part exactly? - The whole thing! Here we go! No, no, no.<br> Give me some specifics.<br> I loved the specifics.<br> The specifics were the best part.<br> Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did you like that part? I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.<br> You fell asleep! There was no kangaroo! They didn't take any of my suggestions! - Thanks for coming.<br> See you later.<br> - Don't go.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Look, this guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! Or call an ambulance! What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come? No.<br> She gave us ideas on how to induce labor.<br> We tried them all.<br> We went for a walk, we tried tea, castor oil, spicy food.<br> Nothing worked.<br> There is one thing we didn't try.<br> But someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms.<br> If it's gonna help bring the baby here, today I think you should do it.<br> - It's sex.<br> - Do it! - Monica.<br> - It's been a really long time for you.<br> I mean, women have needs.<br> Do it.<br> Get yours.<br> Oh, I don't know about that.<br> I think if the two of you had sex, the repercussions would be catastrophic.<br> All right, let's be practical.<br> If Ross isn't willing, he's not the only guy you can have sex with.<br> You could borrow Chandler.<br> Chandler is good.<br> Monica, what is the matter with you? - I just want the baby to be born today.<br> - Why today? Okay, fine.<br> I bet Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby, and I don't want to lose.<br> What? While she's been going through this hell, you've been making money? You're betting on your friend staying in this misery? - I'll take that bet.<br> - What? I'm miserable.<br> I may as well make some money out of it.<br> Can I get some of that action? I'm betting against all of you? I really feel like tomorrow it's gonna happen.<br> Okay.<br> Hey, Sleeping Beauty.<br> Where have you been? I want to talk to you.<br> I still feel bad.<br> Oh, no.<br> Were you upset? Did you lose sleep? I'm so sorry.<br> The reason I came over is to settle things between us.<br> I wanted to pay you back with the premiere, but you missed it.<br> - So how much do I owe you? - What? - I don't want to owe you anything.<br> - You don't owe me.<br> - I don't want your - We're doing this! You got me my first headshots.<br> How much? - I don't know, $500.<br> - Okay, $500.<br> What else? Then there was the second set.<br> The infamous "booger" headshots.<br> Okay, so that's another $500.<br> That's 500 and 500.<br> That's - You want a calculator? - Please.<br> Here.<br> All right, what else? Well, there's acting classes, stage-combat classes, tap classes Which we're still keeping under our hats.<br> That dialect coach who helped you with a Southern accent.<br> Which, after 20 hours of lessons, still came out Jamaican.<br> What the hell are you talking about? The South will rise again, man.<br> Yes, money well-spent.<br> Okay, what else? Rent.<br> Two, three years of rent, utilities, food Okay, so I'm writing you a check for So you fell asleep during my movie.<br> Big deal, right? How do you clear this thing? Finish your enchilada.<br> Ross, we've tried all the spicy food.<br> It's not working.<br> Okay, here, have one of these peppers.<br> Oh, God.<br> So hot.<br> Oh, my God.<br> By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.<br> I am feeling nothing.<br> Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.<br> - Stop it.<br> - Come on! Why are we wasting time? We know it's gonna work.<br> It's doctor-recommended.<br> I'm sorry.<br> But we have to have some boundaries.<br> My God, I'm dying.<br> We've done it before.<br> We'll do it again.<br> It'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.<br> I'm not gonna make love to you so you'll go into labor.<br> Make love? What are you, a girl? Always a great way to get into a man's pants.<br> You'll be performing a service.<br> Think of me as a ketchup bottle.<br> Sometimes, you have to bang on the end of it to get it to come out.<br> I love when you talk dirty to me.<br> I know it.<br> You're right.<br> That's not sexy.<br> Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.<br> Let me just bend over and get it.<br> Oh, God! Okay, enough.<br> This is not going to happen.<br> Come on, Ross.<br> I'm miserable here.<br> Come on, you started this, now you finish it! Come on, wuss.<br> Make love to me.<br> - You know what? - What? Forget it.<br> What now, Ross, you're not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh, wait a minute, I know.<br> You'd think the jalapeno would clear up your sinuses, but no! That's not enough What are you doing?

I guess we could bet one more time.<br> - Is Rachel having the baby? - How did you know that? - Joey! Chandler! - They're at the coffee house.<br> You know everything! Wait.<br> I bet you the baby is over 7 pounds.<br> I bet you it has hair! I bet you it's a girl.<br> - We know it's a girl.<br> - I'll give you really good odds.<br>   <br>
