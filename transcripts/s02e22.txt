                    			I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth.<br> And since it's Rachel's birthday I thought I'd poach a salmon.<br> What? Question.<br> Why do we always have parties where you poach things? You want to be on the food committee? Question 2.<br> Why do we always have parties with committees? Why can't we just get pizza and beer and have fun? I agree.<br> Fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside.<br> And I'm not sure we are.<br> You don't want it to be special? Fine.<br> You can throw any kind of party you want.<br> Joey, they're not real! I start miles beneath the surface of these things.<br> They're fake.<br> See? Honk, honk! Wow, it's like porno for clowns! The One With Two Parties Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.<br> I still have to invite Dylan and Emma and Shannon Cooper.<br> No Shannon Cooper.<br> Why not her? Because she.<br> She steals stuff.<br> Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept with her and never called her back.<br> Joey, that is horrible.<br> Hey, I liked her.<br> Maybe too much.<br> I don't know.<br> I guess I just got scared.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I didn't know.<br> I didn't think anyone would buy that.<br> Okay! Hi, honey.<br> How did it go? It was the graduation from hell.<br> My cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.<br> It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.<br> My sister would graduate from college.<br> Nobody thought she would.<br> It's a testament to what a girl from Long lsland will do for a Celica.<br> What happened? My parents happened.<br> All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile and not talk about the divorce.<br> But no! They got into a fight during the commencement address.<br> Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them.<br> You know the good news? I get to serve coffee for the next eight hours.<br> I guess we don't invite her parents.<br> -How about just her mom? -Why her mom? Because I already invited her.<br> Did you ask Stacy Roth? Can't invite her.<br> She also steals.<br> So does her roomate.<br> Here are the candles.<br> Where's the birthday cake? We're not having birthday cake.<br> We're having birthday flan.<br> Excuse me? It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.<br> That's nice.<br> Happy birthday, Rachel.<br> Here's some goo! Dr.<br> Greene! Oh, my God! It's Rachel's dad.<br> Why are you here? The father can't see the daughter on her birthday? No, no, the father can.<br> But since I am the roommate, I can tell you she's not here.<br> And I'll pass along the message.<br> Okay? So bye-bye.<br> You're having a party.<br> No, no, not a party.<br> Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows.<br> -This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.<br> -I'll never remember all that.<br> So what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff? Is that it? This isn't your first surprise party, is it, sir? Hi, Monica.<br> The Chinese menu guy.<br> Forgot the menus.<br> So basically, just a Chinese guy.<br> Dr.<br> Greene, come with me.<br> We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.<br> All right.<br> That sounds like a two-person job.<br> Well, my goodness! What was that? Sandra, I thought you were Rachel.<br> We weren't ready for you yet.<br> -You thought I was Rachel? -Yes, because you look so young.<br> And because you're both, you know, white women.<br> Oh, I missed you kids.<br> Should I put my coat in the bedroom? -No, I'll take that for you.<br> -Oh, well, thank you.<br> Such a gentleman.<br> Thank you.<br> It all looks so nice.<br> So festive.<br> All the balloons.<br> Oh, the funniest thing happened to me on the way here.<br> -I was driving -That's great!

Come on.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Oh, my God! Think.<br> Think.<br> What would Jack and Chrissy do? Okay, now that your coat is safely in the bed We can come back out in the living room.<br> Joey and Chandler, it's time you take Dr.<br> Greene over to your place.<br> Yes, absolutely.<br> Why, again? Because that's where the party is, you goon! -See, this is just the staging area.<br> -Right, it's the staging area.<br> This is clearly in the wrong apartment.<br> All right, you guys are off to party number one.<br> And you.<br> You are off to party number two.<br> All right, let's keep it moving, let's keep it moving.<br> At least send some women to my party.<br> Okay, that's Ross.<br> All right.<br> Okay, they're coming.<br> Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.<br> Thanks for being born.<br> Thank you for my beautiful earrings.<br> They're perfect.<br> I love you.<br> Now, you can exchange them if you want, okay?

I don't really have a choice.<br> I can look at the bright side.<br> I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.<br> Well, actually just one birthday flan.<br> It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.<br> Talk to Monica.<br> She's on the food committee.<br> Some girl just walked up to me and said, "I want you, Dennis" and stuck her tongue down my throat.<br> I love this party! -Quick volleyball question.<br> -Volleyball.<br> We set up a court in your room.<br> You didn't like that gray lamp, did you? A woman stuck her tongue down my throat.<br> I'm not even listening to you.<br> -Dennis! -Okay, that's me.<br> Can you keep Dad occupied? I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.<br> Do you have any ideas for any openers? Stay clear of "I'm the guy that's doing your daughter" and you should be okay.<br> I want you to take a piece of paper Here you go.<br> And write down your most embarrassing memory.<br> When you're not using the markers, put the caps back on them  because they will dry out.<br> Hi, Dr.<br> Greene.<br> So how's everything in the vascular surgery game? It's not a game, Ross.<br> A woman died on my table today.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That's the good thing about my job.<br> All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.<br> Listen, I don't mean to be a pain about this  but I've noticed some of you are just placing them on.<br> You want to push the caps  until you hear them click.<br> Gunther! Where you going? I was sort of thinking about maybe No! No, you can't go! No, this is fun.<br> We're just starting.<br> Here's your marker.<br> If you want to go, just go.<br> She'll yell at me again.<br> All right, I can get you out.<br> What? In a minute, I'll create a diversion.<br> When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.<br> -I think I need a drink.<br> -I'll get it for you.<br> -What do you want? -Scotch.<br> I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.<br> Neat! Cool.<br> Neat, as in no rocks.<br> I know.<br> Hello, Ross! Where have you been? I have been in the bathroom.<br> Stay clear of the salmon mousse.<br> Scotch neat.<br> That's Rachel's father's drink.<br> Mine too.<br> Isn't that neat? Scotch neat.<br> Would you excuse me? Where are you sneaking off to, mister? I'm getting my cigarettes.<br> No.<br> What do you mean "no"? See, because that's the staging area.<br> You go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.<br> Take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you, sir.<br> -Get my glasses too.<br> -All righty-roo.<br> What a great moment to say that for the first time.<br> Okay, the first person's most embarrassing memory is  "Monica, your party sucks.<br>" Very funny.<br> Oh, no! Did someone forget to use a coaster? What? I don't see anything.<br> Great, I'm seeing water rings again.<br> Ross, whose glasses are those? Mine.<br> You wear bifocals? I have a condition apparently that I require two different sets of focals.<br> Do you know my husband has glasses just like that? Well, those are very popular frames.<br> Neil Sedaka wears them.<br> I hear you can get people out of here.<br> You didn't tell me your boyfriend smokes.<br> Yeah, like a chimney.<br> Big smoker.<br> Big, big smoker.<br> In fact, I'm gonna go into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.<br> Are you wearing my glasses? Yes.<br> I was just warming up the earpieces for you.<br> Thank you.<br> Is that one of my cigarettes? Yes, it is.<br> I was just moistening the tip.<br> She's taking the trash out, so I can get you out of here.<br> But it has to be now.<br> She'll be back any minute.<br> What about my friend? Only the three of you.<br> Any more and she'll get suspicious.<br> -Let me just get my coat.<br> -There isn't time! Just leave everything.<br> They'll take care of you next door.<br> Is it true they have beer? Everything you've heard is true.<br> Could you guys please keep it down? We're trying to start a Boggle tournament.<br> True, if these people find out a funny game, then will be no people left in our party.<br> You! And you.<br> You're supposed to be at my party.<br> And Gunther! What are you doing here? Welcome to the fo All right, I'm sorry.<br> But these people needed me.<br> They work hard all week.<br> It's Saturday night.<br> They deserve to have a little fun.<br> Go! You know, my party is fun.<br> It's a little quieter, less obvious sort of fun.<br> But if people would just give it a chance, it's -You want me to see a therapist? -Sweetheart, you have a problem.<br> You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.<br> Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.<br> But right now, I gotta go.<br> I gotta go do a thing.<br> Did you know your mother spent $1200 on bonsai trees? I felt like Gulliver.<br> Daddy, I really want to hear more about this but I just have to do some stuff.<br> You work and you work and you work at a marriage  but all he cares about is his stupid boat.<br> You work and you work and you work on a boat.<br> He always ridiculed my pottery classes.<br> And you sand it and varnish it.<br> But when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.<br> One night of her yoga and Bridges of Madison County.<br> -The scotch, the cigarettes.<br> - The bonsais and the Chihuahua.<br> I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now but What the hell does she want with half a boat? Okay, okay, you can be shirts and I'll be skins.<br> I'll be skins! How you holding up there, big tiger? Sorry.<br> When my parents were getting divorced, I got a lot of "tigers.<br>" I got a lot of "champs," "chiefs," "sports.<br>" I even got a "governor.<br>" This is it, isn't it? This is what my life will be like.<br> My mom there, my dad there.<br> Thanksgiving, Christmas.<br> She gets the house, he's in a condo my sister will decorate with wicker.<br> How did you get through this? I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and wetting the bed.<br> You know, I just It's so weird.<br> I mean, I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other.<br> All I kept thinking about was the Fourth of July.<br> Because it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other? It's just this thing.<br> Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.<br> Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.<br> My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and Dad would be upset because nobody helping.<br> And when we did help, he'd scream at us for doing it wrong.<br> But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up.<br> You know, and it'd get really cold.<br> And we'd all just sort of smoosh under this one blanket.<br> It never occurred to anybody to bring another one.<br> And now it's.<br> Yeah, I know.<br> Thanks for coming.<br> I hope you had fun.<br> All right, I'm hitting the road.<br> Now, I've left my 10 verbs on the table.<br> Be sure and send me that finished poem.<br> Okay, will do.<br> Glad you came.<br> -I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.<br> -Let me go check.<br> Your mom wants to say goodbye.<br> Happy birthday, sweetie.<br> You drive safe.<br> What are you doing? I'm getting ready for the water skiing.<br> Okay, big hug.<br> One more.<br> Come on! How are you? -Where are you going? -To get my coat.<br> We'll get that for you.<br> All right, all right.<br> I can get my own coat.<br> Sorry, we're on a major flan high.<br> Oh, no.<br> No, you're not supposed to be here.<br> This is the staging area.<br> It's all wrong.<br> You should leave.<br> You know, just get out.<br> Or perhaps you'd like a creme de menthe.<br> I have to be heading toward my chateau.<br> I guess we're going back into the hallway again.<br> Thanks for coming, Mrs.<br> Greene.<br> You take care.<br> Oh, you kids.<br> Well.<br> This is the best party I've been to in years.<br> Thank you! Okay, everybody, it's time for flan! Yep! Get ready for the gelatinous fun.<br> Looks like that stuff you get when you get an infection.<br> Okay, that's enough.<br> Okay, Rachel, make a special flan wish.<br> Okay, I've got one.<br> Heads up! Wow! Those things almost never come true.<br>   <br>
