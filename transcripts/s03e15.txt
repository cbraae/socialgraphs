                    			How much you give me to eat this whole jar of olives? I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me $2.<br>95.<br> Done.<br> I need an atlas! I need an atlas! Why? Do you have a report due? I have a date with diplomat I met.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>while I was giving free massages outside the U.<br>N.<br> And I don't know where his country is.<br> Let's start with the free massages at the U.<br>N.<br> It's my new thing.<br> I figure, "Bodies at peace make peace.<br> " You might just get the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.<br> So what country is this guy from? There's a "g" in there.<br> Where's that? In your atlas! I don't have an atlas.<br> But wait, I do have a globe.<br> Hold on.<br> So what's this guy like? Well, he's very.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>dashing, you know? And very, very sophisticated.<br> And he doesn't speak English.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but his translator says he totally gets me.<br> Okay, here you go.<br> What is this? It's a globe.<br> And a pencil sharpener.<br> Need anything copied? I'm going to the Xerox place.<br> No, thanks.<br> Just give me anything I can make two of.<br> If you have nothing to copy, why go there? Are you just gonna gawk at that girl.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>with the bellybutton ring again? You wanna come? The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) Come on, Chloe.<br> Finish with your customer first.<br> Come on, Chloe.<br> Come on, Chloe! Can I help you? We're having second thoughts about our copying needs.<br> And we'll need more time to think about it.<br> Chloe, switch with me.<br> Some guys have a crush on you.<br> Okay, that hurt us.<br> Hi, guys.<br> I haven't seen you since this morning.<br> Well.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you know.<br> What are you doing tomorrow? Both of us? Maybe.<br> Does that scare you? Relax.<br> Isaac's deejaying at The Philly.<br> -You should come.<br> -We'll be there.<br> Great.<br> I'll see you then.<br> All right! Rock on.<br> He says that walking with you makes this strange city feel like home.<br> Me too.<br> Although this city is my home.<br> So that's dumb, what I said.<br> Don't tell him I said that.<br> You make something up.<br> Nice! Thank you.<br> This is me, here.<br> Your eyes are very pretty.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> He would like to kiss you.<br> You don't have to do that now.<br> No, no, not him! No, you don't.<br> The moment's over.<br> There it is, right there.<br> It's small.<br> Yeah, but Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to get all the way across it.<br> So you had fun? Except for, you know, when you're on a date.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you're getting along great.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way? Is Rach in her room? She's still at work, but she said to call her.<br> Is she gonna cancel on me again? How could she do this? What about our anniversary? This is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.<br> "Call Rachel.<br> " What's that on the bottom? That's my doodle of a ladybug with a top hat.<br> She's fancy.<br> -Hey, honey.<br> -Oh, hi.<br> What's going on? Shipping had a disaster.<br> I've gotta get this order in.<br> I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'll be here all night.<br> What? Well, how about I come up there? No, honey, please.<br> I just have too much to deal with.<br> Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Could you be the translator's date.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so that when we want to be alone.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you two can split off? You know, he's kind of cute.<br> Like, "really kind of cute"? Or "kind of cute" Iike your friend Spackle-Back Larry? Don't call him that.<br> His name is Spackle-Back Harry.<br> Maybe we should get going.<br> What time did Chloe say to get there? -1 0:30.<br> -What time is it now? So we'll hang out.<br> Remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us? Yes, vividly.<br> -She was kidding about that, right? -Yeah, I think so.<br> Yeah, I think so.<br> God, it'd be weird if that situation presented itself tonight.<br> Yeah, I mean.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>what would we do? Dude, I don't know.<br> She was kidding.<br> She was.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Just in case, we should have some ground rules.<br> Yeah.<br> For sure.<br> You probably want the first one to be, "Never open your eyes.<br> " Because you don't want to be doing something.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then look up, right? And see something that you don't want to be seeing.<br> Good call.<br> Nice.<br> Hold it! Hold it! What if my eyes are closed, and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and my hand is out there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Okay, eyes open at all times! How do we decide where we.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you know, each would.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>be? Right.<br> Well, you know, we could flip for it.<br> I guess.<br> But like, what's heads and what's tails? If you don't know that, I don't want to do this with you.<br> No, no.<br> I am looking at a purchase order here.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that shows we ordered the Riviera bikini.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in a variety of sizes and colors-- What does it matter what I'm wearing? Could I speak to your supervisor? Thank you.<br> Hi.<br> My God! What are you doing here? Well, you said you couldn't go out, so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You brought a picnic! What a boyfriend.<br> That's it.<br> On Monday, I start wearing makeup.<br> Honey, this is very nice, but I've got a crisis.<br> But I've got couscous! Honey, I know it's our anniversary.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I told you on the phone, I don't have time to stop.<br> You don't have to stop.<br> I'm invisible.<br> I'm not here.<br> Yeah, but I don't-- Who approved that order? Well, there is no Mark Robinson in this office.<br> -Get Mark on the phone! -I love Mark.<br> Do you know him? Let me check that with what I've got.<br> See, 038 is not the number for this store.<br> 038 is Atlanta.<br> Pepper? None for me.<br> Okay, sorry! Sorry.<br> As I was saying, the store number is wrong.<br> And I'm sorry, but-- Oh, my God! I have to call you back.<br> I've got Shemp in my office.<br> -What are you doing? -I'm sorry.<br> But somebody's off the phone! How about a glass of wine.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>by the fire? I can get it going again.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You're not listening.<br> I don't have time to stop.<br> -You don't have 1 0 minutes? -I don't have 1 0 minutes! -Sophie, does she have 1 0 minutes? -I told you, I don't! Don't yell.<br> This is the most I've seen you all week.<br> Look, I cannot do this right now.<br> I've got a deadline! Go home and we'll talk later.<br> -Yeah, but wait--! -Goodbye! Actually, that's our three-hole punch.<br> Hi.<br> Look, about what happened earlier-- I completely understand.<br> You were stressed.<br> I was gonna give you a chance to apologize to me.<br> For letting you throw me out of your office? You had no right coming down to my office.<br> You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>unless they're a park ranger! Excuse me for wanting to be with my girl on our anniversary.<br> Boy, what an ass am l! But I told you I didn't have the time! Well, you never have the time.<br> I don't feel like I have a girlfriend anymore.<br> Do you want me to quit my job.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>so you can feel like you have a girlfriend? It would nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.<br> Just a job? It's the first time in my life I'm doing something I care about! The first time I'm doing something I'm good at! If you don't get that-- I get that, and I'm happy for you.<br> But I'm tired of dating your answering machine! I don't know what to do! Well, neither do l! Is this about Mark? Oh, my God! Okay, it's not.<br> Oh, my God! I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again.<br> You're making this too hard.<br> I'm making this too hard? What should I do? I don't know! I don't know! Look.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>maybe we should just take a break! Fine, you're right.<br> Let's take a break.<br> Let's cool off.<br> Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.<br> A break from us.<br> --advances in collating in the past five years.<br> We just got in an X-5000, you know? The X-5000 makes an X-50 look like a T-71 .<br> It's the dinosaur guy! -Hi, Ross! -Hi, Chloe.<br> I want you to meet some friends of mine.<br> He's my hero.<br> He'll want to blow stuff up 400 percent.<br> We say we don't do that.<br> He says, "You gotta.<br> " Know what? We did it.<br> Now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say, "Let's Ross it! " And that's the only color that comes in.<br> Yo, Chloe! Do you have a quarter for the condom machine? What are you doing? I thought tonight's your anniversary dinner.<br> A little change of plans.<br> We're gonna break up instead.<br> And I can speak a little French.<br> Why? What did I say? Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.<br> Oh, my God! No wonder I get such great service at CafÃ© Maurice.<br> Knock, knock, knock.<br> Hi.<br> Could you please tell Sergei that I was fascinated.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in the Times? You didn't say "Boutros Boutros-Ghali.<br> " Boutros Boutros-Ghali.<br> He says he was too.<br> Interesting.<br> So I was wondering-- Before you get all talky again.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>could you also please tell Sergei.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that I really like his suit.<br> He said, "Thank you.<br> You look pretty tonight.<br> Your hair, golden like the sun.<br> " So you're a chef? I'm also thinking of opening up my own restaurant.<br> Really? Could I talk to you behind my menu? What are you doing? Well, I was having a conversation.<br> Misha's so interested in you, Sergei and I haven't been able to talk at all.<br> You want me to sit silently, while you three converse? That would be great.<br> Thank you.<br> Hi.<br> It's Mark.<br> What? ls it my breath? Sorry.<br> I just thought you were somebody else.<br> I was just gonna leave a message.<br> Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner? Rach? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.<br> You wanna talk? I can come over.<br> Really, no.<br> Please.<br> That's okay.<br> All right.<br> I'm coming over with Chinese food.<br> I'm not hungry.<br> It's for me.<br> Bye.<br> -So what'll you do? -What can I do? One person wants to break up, you break up.<br> No way.<br> This is you guys.<br> Call her and work it out.<br> We just had this huge fight.<br> Don't I have to wait awhile? It isn't like swimming after you eat.<br> Pick up the phone! You know that swimming thing is a myth.<br> Tell that to my Uncle Lenny.<br> Why? What happened to him? Nothing.<br> He just really believes in that.<br> Then we got into this big fight-- It was awful.<br> I told him he treats me like a park ranger, something.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> And then.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I told him I wanted to take a break.<br> I don't want to take a break.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Egg roll? And then I called him and he wasn't there.<br> He's probably just out.<br> Thank you, that's very helpful.<br> I'm glad you came over.<br> Hi, it's me.<br> Oh, I'm so glad you called.<br> Really? This is crazy.<br> Don't you think we can work on this? What do you want to drink? Who's that? Nobody? Is it okay if I finish the apple juice? Is that Mark? Honey, he just came over-- Yeah, got it! Hey, Dinosaur Guy! Look at you, so sad.<br> Come dance.<br> That's okay.<br> Thanks.<br> You don't have to smile.<br> You just have to dance.<br> I don't feel like dancing.<br> I feel like having a drink, okay? Two beers! And the vet said it was time.<br> And so from half a world away.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>while my mother held the phone to his ear.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I said goodbye to my dog.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in seven languages.<br> -Could I have a tissue? -Oh, sure.<br> I just hope you don't accidentally.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>suck it up through your nose and choke on it.<br> Sergei would like to apologize for my behavior tonight.<br> Well, tell him, "Apology accepted.<br> " Unbelievable.<br> For the first time in years, someone wants to talk to me.<br> But do you think he would let me enjoy that? No! You silly diplomat.<br> Why don't you learn some English? Excuse me, but isn't he paying for your dinner? The man's dog just died.<br> I have just resigned my post.<br> Will you accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.<br> It would be my pleasure.<br> My guy has coupons.<br> Your guy can't even say "coupons.<br> " Plate.<br> Plate! Yes! Plate! See, we don't need them.<br> I like this song.<br> Well, you're practically dancing, already.<br> Why don't you just do it over here? What are you, married? Because that's okay.<br> Oh, be home, be home, be home.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You're not home.<br> Still no smile? --Miss American Pie Ameri-can.<br> It's a very hard language.<br> Let's do it again.<br>   <br>
