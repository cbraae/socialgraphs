                    			You have got to try this cheesecake.<br> You know, I'm not that much of a sweet tooth Oh, my God, it's so creamy! That's the best cheesecake I've ever had! Where did you get this? It was at the front door when I got home.<br> Somebody sent it to us.<br> This isn't addressed to you.<br> This is addressed to Mrs.<br> Braverman downstairs! Thief! I didn't read the box before I opened it and you can't return a box after you opened it! - Why not? - Because it's too delicious! You stole this cheesecake.<br> That's wrong.<br> No, it'll be okay because Mrs.<br> Braverman will send for a free one.<br> That way, we all win.<br> The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate "Mama's Little Bakery.<br> " I feel terrible.<br> I'm a horrible, horrible person.<br> I'm sorry, what? The One With All The Cheesecakes I should get going.<br> Big day at work.<br> You know how I'm in a coma? Today they do a test on me and it turns out I'm not brain-dead.<br> So Mr.<br> Smarty Pants.<br> It's just my character that's not brain-dead.<br> Pheebs, still on for tonight? - Absolutely.<br> - I'll see you at 8.<br> What's at 8? Dinner.<br> We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you.<br> Wow! Did not know that.<br> May I say how lovely you look today? Duly noted.<br> So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together? - What are you talking about? - Cousin Frannie's wedding.<br> You were invited? No.<br> Oh, my God, I can't believe this.<br> I thought only Mom and Dad were invited.<br> From the ages of 7 to 9, Frannie and I were inseparable.<br> Maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.<br> It's probably just a mistake.<br> Let me call Aunt Cheryl.<br> Maybe you are invited and the invitation got lost in the mail.<br> You call her and tell her that when we were kids her precious Frannie tried to undress me several times.<br> If I hadn't stopped her, there wouldn't be a wedding to go to.<br> She tried to undress me too.<br> I used to undress my cousin Glenn.<br> Joseph Francis Tribbiani, are you home yet? I think he's still out.<br> What's wrong? I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Greene.<br> I had plans with Joey, and he left me this note.<br> "Pheebs, can't make it.<br> Got a date.<br> Talk to you later.<br> Big Daddy.<br> " - "Big Daddy"? - That's a nickname we were trying.<br> You know what nickname never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron.<br> " Here's Joseph Francis! Wait, what are you middle-naming me for? I left you a note.<br> That doesn't give you the right to ditch me! You can cancel plans with friends if there's a possibility for sex.<br> He's right.<br> That is the rule.<br> I don't accept it.<br> When we make plans, I expect you to show up.<br> I'm not a way to kill time till you meet someone better.<br> Boyfriends and girlfriends will come and go, but this is for life.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I had no idea it would bother you this much.<br> Well, it does.<br> Well, can I make it up to you? I'm sorry.<br> How about dinner tomorrow night? I'll pay for myself.<br> Okay, you wore me down.<br> While you're over there, how about a beer for "The Ross-a-tron"? "Ross" Is that back? The other cheesecake came.<br> They delivered it here again.<br> Just bring it downstairs.<br> What's the problem? I can't seem to say goodbye.<br> Are you serious? We ate an entire cake two days ago and you want more? Well, I've forgotten what it tastes like.<br> It was cheesecake.<br> It was fine.<br> It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust with a very rich yet light cream cheese filling.<br> Wow, my whole mouth just filled with saliva.<br> Know what? Forget it.<br> We're just hungry.<br> We haven't had lunch.<br> We're just lightheaded.<br> So let's go have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.<br> We'll drop it off so we're not tempted.<br> - Where do you want to eat? - Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago.<br> Mel TormÃ© died.<br> Joey, that paper's like a year old.<br> Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over? So, I finally heard back from Aunt Cheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake.<br> There's limited seating Limited seating? I am just one tiny person! Yeah, but she doesn't know that.<br> I mean, the last time she saw you you'd have turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.<br> "Limited seating.<br> " That's such a lame excuse.<br> That's not the reason she's not inviting me.<br> What's the big deal? I wasn't invited to the ceremony, just the reception.<br> If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then we'll leave early as a sign of protest.<br> - Joan? - Yeah, my date.<br> Assistant professor in linguistics.<br> Tall, very beautiful.<br> And despite what some people say, not broad-backed.<br> Wait a minute.<br> You got "Ross Geller and Guest"? I wasn't invited, and you got "and Guest"? Excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross' behalf.<br> I think the rule applies here.<br> Since he has a chance to get on broad-back Not broad-back! Wait a minute.<br> You're bringing me.<br> I can't cancel on Joan.<br> - Why not? - Did you not hear me? She's an assistant professor in the linguistics department.<br> They're wild.<br> - Why do you want to come anyway? - Because she's my cousin.<br> I mean, we grew up together.<br> Family, you know? And all that's important to me.<br> Okay, all right.<br> I'll take you.<br> I'll go call Joan.<br> Oh, that's nice.<br> Family should be there.<br> It's her wedding.<br> Happiest day of her life.<br> We'll see.<br> Well, thank you for lunch.<br> Wait, I thought you paid.<br> Apparently, we don't pay for food anymore.<br> - Do you see what I see? - It's still there.<br> Mrs.<br> Braverman must be out.<br> She could be out of town.<br> Maybe gone for months.<br> By then, it may spoil.<br> She can't come back to bad cheesecake.<br> - It could kill her.<br> - Don't want that.<br> We're protecting her.<br> - We'll take it.<br> - But quick.<br> - Why? - I hear her in there.<br> Go! Go! Go! Oh, my God, that's David.<br> - Who? - David, the scientist guy.<br> David that I was in love with.<br> Who went to Russia and broke my heart, David.<br> Oh, my God! Say their name enough, they turn around.<br> Phoebe.<br> David.<br> What are you doing? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia? I'm just in town for a conference.<br> God, you look phenomenal.<br> Well .<br> Yeah.<br> You look great too.<br> Did you get a haircut? Yeah.<br> Well, I got like 30 of them.<br> Look, I got a confession to make.<br> I was hoping to run into you here.<br> I didn't know if I should call.<br> I was only in town a few days and I didn't want to intrude on your life.<br> I really wanted to see you but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.<br> Of course I would want to see you.<br> I think about you all the time.<br> Really? Because I think about you all the time.<br> There's a statue in Minsk that reminds me of you so much.<br> It's actually of Lenin but, you know, at certain angles .<br> Anyway, do you want to have dinner tonight? Yes.<br> Oh, no! - What? - I can't.<br> I can't believe I have plans.<br> Can you do it tomorrow? No, I have to go in a few hours.<br> I have to be on the redeye.<br> Listen, next time you're in Minsk .<br> Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second? What are you doing? I have plans with Joey.<br> So? He'll understand.<br> No, he won't.<br> And that's not even the point.<br> I made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends.<br> And now just because, potentially, the love of my life returns from Russia for one night I should change my beliefs? I should change my beliefs! No.<br> If I don't have my principles, I don't have anything.<br> You're so strong.<br> Or I should rush through dinner with Joey and meet David at 9.<br> Oh, my God, that is so good! I'm full.<br> And yet I know if I stop eating this I'll regret it.<br> Hey, what have you got there? Oh, it's .<br> It's tofu cake.<br> Want some? What are you doing tonight? Dude.<br> Dude.<br> Sorry.<br> I got plans with Phoebe.<br> Really? Monica said she had a date at 9.<br> - What? Tonight? - That's what Monica said.<br> After that speech, she makes a date on the same night she has plans with me? She's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy.<br> Here, I think this is us.<br> Limited seating, my ass.<br> Let's see who made the cut.<br> Hi.<br> I'm Monica Geller.<br> - How do you know the bride and groom? - I worked with Frannie.<br> Used to work with her.<br> Used to.<br> I'm a relative and I didn't get invited.<br> A blood relative.<br> Blood.<br> Stop saying "blood" to strangers.<br> And you? How do you know the couple? We went to college with both of them.<br> Now we live next door.<br> Okay, you're fine.<br> - Are you guys ready? - Yes.<br> I'll have a green salad, house dressing and water's fine.<br> And for you, sir? Yeah.<br> This slow-roasted salmon how slow are we talking? It's already been roasted.<br> Oh, then no.<br> Maybe I should hear the specials again.<br> We've heard the specials three times.<br> There's prime rib, mahi-mahi and a very special lobster ravioli.<br> - Actually, we're out of the ravioli.<br> - Well, that changes everything! You know what, Pheebs? You were right before.<br> Friends are so important.<br> Yeah, I'm very wise.<br> I know.<br> Know what I really want? - What? - Is to have a long, long talk.<br> You know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.<br> - Any progress? - Yes.<br> I will have the lobster ravioli.<br> God, Joey, this is taking forever.<br> - What's the rush? - Well I have an appointment.<br> And it's very important.<br> What is it? Well it's a date.<br> A date? No, you must be mistaken, because you wouldn't have a date on the same night you have plans with a friend.<br> Don't make me feel badly.<br> No, I'm gonna! You made me feel really guilty about going out with that girl.<br> Like I did something terrible.<br> Now you're doing the same thing.<br> It's not! It's totally different! This is with David.<br> Remember David, the scientist guy? He's very special to me.<br> My girl the other night was special.<br> She was a scientist too.<br> - She was? - Well, she graduated high school.<br> Whatever.<br> Know what? He's only here for four hours and I'm gonna go see him.<br> - Fine! - Yeah.<br> What are you still doing here? I told you, lobster ravioli! I was about to leave.<br> I didn't think you were coming.<br> I wouldn't have missed this.<br> Well, I'm very glad you're here.<br> Oh, you're such a gentleman.<br> Come on, we're going to my place.<br> Are you eating the cheesecake without me? I will give you $ 100 to whistle right now.<br> - How can you eat it without me? - What'll you do? Tell Monica or Joey? No, you'd have to tell them everything.<br> We're dessert stealers.<br> We're living outside the law.<br> I don't trust you with this cake.<br> I got it first, and I'm taking it back! - What? Oh, no.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> You think I trust you with it? No, we'll split it.<br> That's not fair.<br> You had some.<br> I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake "dry and mealy.<br> " What do we use to split it? All right, pick a half.<br> Well, this side looks bigger.<br> But there's more crust on this side.<br> Maybe if I measure it Pick a piece! - All right, I pick that one.<br> - It's the smaller piece.<br> Okay.<br> There you go.<br> Enjoy your half, my friend.<br> But that is it.<br> No sharing, no switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece too fast.<br> - You gonna give me some of yours? - Oh, no.<br> No switching, no sharing.<br> And don't come crying to me.<br> I may just sit here and have my cake all day.<br> Just sit here in the hallway and eat my Ross, sweetheart! Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.<br> - Isn't it a beautiful wedding? - Yes, it is.<br> Every time, on the lips! Why? Why on the lips? There's Frannie.<br> Won't she be happy to see me? You be nice, all right? I didn't bring you to ambush her.<br> Frannie was the one who showed your Playboys to Mom.<br> That bitch.<br> Monica! What? Am I doing here? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me.<br> How do you like that? Hi, Frannie.<br> Congratulations.<br> You invite my whole family, and not me? Why? Why wouldn't you want me here? What could I have done? Stuart! I believe you know my husband.<br> So it's really a question of "who" could you have done.<br> I hate this, but I have to go.<br> I can't miss my flight.<br> I bet there's another flight to Minsk in July.<br> That's really beautiful.<br> What does it mean? "Please clean my beakers.<br> " I don't get out of the lab much.<br> I thought it meant something else.<br> Yeah, well, I really actually wanted to say that.<br> But I figured I probably shouldn't because I have to leave.<br> No, you're right.<br> Don't say it.<br> I do, though.<br> I do too.<br> Well, bye, Phoebe.<br> Now's not the time, Joey.<br> You can yell at me tomorrow.<br> Wait, no, Pheebs.<br> I'm not gonna yell at you.<br> I just started thinking about you and David and I remember how bummed you were the first time he left.<br> Oh, Pheebs, come here.<br> - Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay.<br> The only guy I've ever been crazy about is going to Minsk and I may never see him again.<br> You could always visit him.<br> Right.<br> Like they'll let me have a passport.<br> Anything I can do? Whatever you need.<br> Well, now if you achieve distillation of subatomic particles before he does then he could come back.<br> I could give it a shot.<br> Oh, look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it.<br> - Stick to your side! - Come on, now! All right, what are we having? Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.<br> Okay, wait here.<br> Hi, sweetie! Are you leaving? - Well - Give us a kiss.<br> Come on.<br> Why? Why on the lips?   <br>
