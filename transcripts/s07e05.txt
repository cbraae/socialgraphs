                    			Hey.<br> -What's the matter? -Someone on the subway licked my neck! Willy's still alive! -What are you doing? -My mom called.<br> They're announcing our engagement in the paper.<br> -We're looking for a good picture.<br> -I'm afraid that does not exist.<br> There are great pictures of us.<br> No, there are great pictures of you next to a guy who's going like this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Oh, my God, that's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.<br> I don't know what it is.<br> I just can't take a good picture.<br> MONICA: Here's a great one.<br> -Yeah, I'm not in that.<br> -No, but look at me, all tan.<br> Why don't you get portraits done by a professional photographer? That's a great idea.<br> I bet they have one of those wind machines.<br> Yeah, that's great.<br> Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.<br> -Chandler, what do you say? -All right, but I'm not going.<br> "I'm" going.<br> The One With The Engagement Picture Gelula/SDI Dude, that reverse lay-up.<br> -And how about those three-pointers? -Amazing.<br> And those guys were this close to letting us play this time too.<br> Hey, look.<br> Phoebe's talking to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.<br> You call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"? We call him "Hums While He Pees.<br> " Yes, and we call Ross "Lingers in the Bathroom.<br> " Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees" just asked me out.<br> -I thought that guy was married.<br> -He's getting divorced.<br> Ross, maybe you know him.<br> It's not a club.<br> If he's getting a divorce, is it a good idea to date him? -Hey, divorced men are not bad men.<br> -That's on the napkins at the club.<br> -I gotta go to work.<br> -You don't have to go for a half-hour.<br> My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups in the office during lunch.<br> I could just spread him on a cracker.<br> Rach, why would you hire this guy? -You know you can't date him, right? -I know that.<br> We joked that we spend so much time together.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he should call me his "work-wife.<br> " Soon he'll be able to call you "that lady he knew that got fired.<br> " I won't get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.<br> You wouldn't mind if he was dating someone? Why, is he? He is, isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing.<br> Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.<br> Dude, that's so sad.<br> I could put a basketball court in the back.<br> Could I play? Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag? -I just did them.<br> -Well, drop and give me 1 0 more.<br> What? I had a drink with lunch.<br> -Did those cost reports come in? -I did them last night.<br> Could you make me 4 copies? -Sure.<br> -Great, thank you.<br> Huh.<br> Oh.<br> -Hey, Rachel.<br> -Hi, Melissa.<br> What's up? I'm just about to go out to the store.<br> Get some stuff to put in my backpack.<br> Dried fruit and granola, and stuff like that.<br> -What's up? -Is Tag here? No.<br> Why? I was gonna talk to him about tonight.<br> Really? You got a little crush on Tag there, do ya? We've been flirting back and forth.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I was hoping tonight it would turn into something a little more.<br> Easy there, Melissa.<br> This ain't a locker room, okay.<br> But you know, I remember him saying that he had plans tonight.<br> -Oh, no.<br> -Oh, yeah.<br> All right, back to work.<br> Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack? I don't want to be known as the office bitch, but I'll call your supervisor.<br> PHOTOGRAPHER: Great, that's great, Monica.<br> Great.<br> Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile? Okay.<br> -I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? -No, I am.<br> Chandler, I know you can do this.<br> You have a beautiful smile.<br> -I do? -Yeah.<br> Maybe you don't have to smile.<br> Let's try something else.<br> -Try looking sexy.<br> -Okay.<br> Or not.<br> Hi, Joey, what are you doing here? I got an audition down the street, and I spilled sauce on my shirt.<br> -You got an extra one? -Yeah, sure.<br> Here.<br> Great.<br> You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren? Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.<br> I guess this'll be fine.<br> -What are you doing tonight? -Nothing.<br> Why? How would you feel about taking out Tag? I'll pay.<br> It's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.<br> I'm not asking you to go on a date with him.<br> Really? Because I could kind of use the money.<br> He's new in town and he doesn't have any guy friends.<br> Take him to a ball game or something.<br> I'd appreciate it.<br> -Yeah, okay, no problem.<br> -Thank you.<br> Ooh, hey, doughnuts! I know.<br> Let's try a look.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>of far-off wonderment.<br> Gaze into our future and think about our marriage and the days to come.<br> Chandler, what is the matter with your face? This picture should say "Geller and Bing to be married" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>not "Local woman saves drowning moron.<br> " (LAUGHS) Hey, don't laugh at him.<br> He's my drowning moron.<br> That's it, that's it! Take it, take it! I like this one.<br> It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you.<br> " Can't all be bad.<br> Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.<br> There it is.<br> Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes? Why did you ever sleep with me? Do you really want to pull at that thread? -I'm having a good time.<br> -Me too.<br> Sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck.<br> No, that's okay.<br> He's a friend.<br> I don't mean to be presumptuous.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I have tickets to the ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.<br> Yeah, l-- Well, I missed the semifinals, so I think I would just be lost.<br> I know it's lame, but I got these tickets from my boss-- Oh, no, no, no, my God! Okay, don't freak out.<br> I'll go.<br> It's my ex-wife, Whitney.<br> I cannot deal with her now.<br> She's crazy.<br> Okay, I know.<br> Hold on.<br> -Hey, Ross.<br> -Yeah.<br> That's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there.<br> Do you think you could divert her so we could slip out? What? No.<br> Okay, but I have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals.<br> I don't think so, Pheebs.<br> All right, I'll do it.<br> -But just because you're a friend.<br> -Okay.<br> Oh! Hi, Ginger.<br> I want my key back.<br> -I don't have it.<br> -It's right there.<br> Okay, Sherlock.<br> I'm sorry, but you'd better go.<br> I just wanted to thank you for diverting Kyle's ex.<br> You're welcome.<br> We'll talk about it later.<br> -Hi, Whitney.<br> -Hi, Ross.<br> -Are you ready for breakfast? -Yep.<br> Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her.<br> Can you give me a second while I talk to this woman.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who, by the way, did not spend the night? -Sure.<br> -Okay.<br> I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay? Watching ballroom dancing? Yes, that's where we realized we were both super cool people.<br> Look, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.<br> Like what? Like she's really mean, and she's overly critical and-- She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you.<br> Okay.<br> And she uses sex as a weapon.<br> Thank you for warning me.<br> At breakfast, I'll be on alert for room painting and sex weapons.<br> -You're still gonna go out with her? -Yeah.<br> Well, didn't you hear what I just said? Pheebs, come on.<br> I mean, consider the source.<br> Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff.<br> Now if you'll excuse me.<br> Listen to me, she is crazy! WHITNEY: Your door isn't soundproof.<br> You see? Nothing is good enough for her.<br> -Morning.<br> -Hi, Tag.<br> -Did you have fun with Joey? -Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.<br> That's nice.<br> Then we went to a bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.<br> Women? You mean, like old women? Kind of old, like 30.<br> I never used to be able to talk to girls in bars.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.<br> That's great.<br> Joey must have really taught you some stuff.<br> A little.<br> How you doing? See? That's a great smile.<br> Easy, natural.<br> Now pretend I have a camera.<br> -You're changing it.<br> -I can't help it.<br> You want to know what I do when I take rÃ©sumÃ© shots? Borrow money from me? Yeah.<br> Okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous.<br> So here's what I do.<br> I look down, look down, keep looking down.<br> Then I look up.<br> See? Now you try.<br> Look down.<br> You're looking down.<br> Keep looking down.<br> Why is there jelly on your shoe? I had a donut.<br> -Hi.<br> -Hey.<br> So, I heard you had some fun with Tag last night.<br> Yeah, that guy's all right.<br> Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "Joey.<br> " -What? -You know, all the women.<br> You can't teach someone to be good with women.<br> That's why I never had any luck with Chandler.<br> I'm right here.<br> Would you mind just not going out with him again? Just the idea of you and he and all these women-- I know he's my assistant, and we can't date! But it bothers me, all right? No, no, no, you can't take him away from me.<br> I got a great partner to pick up girls with.<br> Finally! I'm still right here.<br> Will you talk to him.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and tell him how unsatisfying this dating-tons-of-women thing is? What? I don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush.<br> I will get over it.<br> It's not like I love him.<br> It's just physical.<br> I get these crushes all the time.<br> I had a crush on you at first.<br> I know.<br> Monica told me.<br> Did you have a crush on me when we first met? Yeah, sure.<br> Can you people not see me? Will you talk to him? -I don't know, Rach.<br> -I'll give you 1 0 Ralph Lauren shirts.<br> One.<br> No, 1 0.<br> You said 1 0.<br> You can't take that back.<br> You wanted to talk to me? I don't know.<br> You got something for me? Yeah, this is from Rachel.<br> Ten.<br> Okay.<br> Tag, there's such a thing as too many women.<br> -Really? -Yeah, for you.<br> -Hey, there you are.<br> -There I am.<br> -You okay? -Yeah, Joey said I needed to relax.<br> So he gave me an antihistamine.<br> What? I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn.<br> Brooklyn is far.<br> What were you thinking? But don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now.<br> Okay, see.<br> Look down.<br> Look down.<br> Look down.<br> -Chandler? -Yeah? -Hi.<br> -Hi.<br> How are things going with Crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet? Listen, you are hearing one side of the story.<br> Okay? FYl, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>before she painted that room.<br> And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass.<br> " Maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and a little more time in the bedroom.<br> I don't think we are going to have that problem.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but maybe it's because I am not emotionally unavailable.<br> You think he's emotionally unavailable? I think he can be.<br> Maybe he wouldn't be.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>if she didn't bring the office home every night.<br> Excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.<br> Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1 997.<br> I knew you were going to throw that in my face! That was three years ago.<br> She apologized and apologized.<br> What more do you want?! We want the last 6 years back! So do we! So do we! I'm sorry you had to see that.<br> -Morning, Rachel.<br> -Hi.<br> Hey, so, what'd you do last night? -Went out with Joey.<br> -Yeah? Another night of bird-dogging the chicas? No, we had a really good talk.<br> I don't think I'll do the bar scene anymore.<br> Wow, I did not see that coming.<br> It's just not really who I am.<br> I've always been happier when-- Why am I telling you this? -You don't care about this stuff.<br> -Yes, I do.<br> You were saying, "I'm happier when l.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> " When I'm in a relationship.<br> -I love having a girlfriend.<br> -Really? Someone I can spoil, you know.<br> Spoil? -Let me ask you something.<br> -Uh-huh? Do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone? I'm starting to.<br> And if that person's in your life you should do something about it? Yes.<br> Hell, yes.<br> -All right, then, it's settled.<br> -Okay.<br> -I'm getting back together with my ex.<br> -I would love to! What? Hello? Oh.<br> This is gonna be a while.<br> Excuse me.<br> Yeah.<br> (PHOEBE TAPS SPOON) My God! Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Is that annoying? And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney? Maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>if someone else knew where everything was.<br> Oh, he knows.<br> For the most part.<br> Oh, hey.<br> Good, you're both here.<br> We kind of need to talk.<br> -Both of you together? -What's up? Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and we got to reminiscing.<br> KYLE: We talked most of the night.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and realized the reason we're angry with each other.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is because there are still feelings there.<br> So.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Oh, just say it, Kyle! We're gonna try again.<br> What about her whining, and her constant need for attention? I'll work on that.<br> Right, because you're so capable of change.<br> You know, he hums when he pees.<br> -I do know.<br> -Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.<br> We're so sorry.<br> That's all right.<br> We don't need you.<br> I'm over it already.<br> Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.<br> Yeah, we're gonna go.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Pheebs, you were right about her.<br> You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.<br> Yeah, I hurt my back a little.<br> You know, he hums while he does other stuff too.<br> We're better off without them.<br> Even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club.<br> -Divorced men's club.<br> -Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.<br> Hey, guys, check it out.<br> -My mom sent me the paper.<br> -Let's see it.<br> -Oh, yeah, that looks good.<br> -You make a very attractive couple.<br> -Yeah, we look great together.<br> -We really do.<br> Okay.<br> Imagine what our kids would look like.<br> We don't have to imagine.<br> I'm marrying her.<br> We'll just see.<br>   <br>
