                    			Hey, you guys, guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.<br> What is the matter with you? No.<br> Barry and Mindy.<br> Oh, sorry.<br> I hear "divorce," I immediately go to Ross.<br> Who's Barry and Mindy? Barry was the guy I almost married, and Mindy was my best friend.<br> Wasn't he cheating on you with her? That means he was falling asleep on her instead of me.<br> Can you imagine if I'd married him? How different would my life be? I've always wondered how different life would be.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>if I'd never gotten divorced.<br> -Which time? -The first time! Imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.<br> I can't.<br> I keep seeing it the good way.<br> I bet I'd still be doing my karate.<br> Towards the end of our marriage, I did karate to release the tension.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>from not doing anything else physical.<br> Maybe the problem was pronouncing it ka-ra-tay.<br> What if I was still fat? You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.<br> -Sure I would.<br> -Come on.<br> You think I'm that shallow? I think Monica was that fat.<br> Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired off Days of Our Lives.<br> Hey.<br> Hey, there's Carol again.<br> What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, being paid to be funny.<br> But my job's fun too.<br> I mean, tomorrow.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I don't have to wear a tie.<br> What if I'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch? -What? -Merrill Lynch? A massage client who worked there said I had a knack for stocks.<br> Why didn't you take it? At that time, I thought everything that rhymed was true.<br> I thought if I worked with stocks.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'd have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.<br> Do you think if all those things happened, we'd still hang out? The One That Could Have Been Part 1 Gelula/SDI Oh, my God.<br> Rachel Green? Rob Tilman! No, no, it's me.<br> Ross.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> Ross Tilman.<br> -No.<br> No, no.<br> Ross Geller.<br> -Of course! Monica's brother.<br> -Yeah.<br> Right.<br> -Wow! How are you? Good.<br> Good, I'm married.<br> Me too! -Isn't it the best? -Oh, it's the best.<br> -So how's Monica? -Really, really great.<br> Actually, she's right down the street.<br> You should stop by and say hi.<br> -I would love to.<br> -She'd be so excited.<br> -Okay.<br> -Come on.<br> Wait, don't you have to pay for.<br> .<br> .<br> Busty Ladies? No, that's okay.<br> Some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but l.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> So, Monica.<br> Still going out with Dr.<br> Boring? He's not boring.<br> He's just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> He's low-key.<br> -Here you go, one hazelnut latte.<br> -Thank you.<br> You know, the hazelnut, actually not a nut.<br> It's a seed.<br> Wow.<br> Can anyone else name a well-known seed that's been masquerading as a nut? Oh, dear God.<br> Let me think.<br> What's the matter? Another rejection letter.<br> They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic" funny.<br> I must get back to the hospital.<br> -Bye.<br> -Bye-bye.<br> By the way, the answer is: The Brazil nut.<br> Was his question, "What's more boring than him?" Hey, man.<br> Sorry about that Archie thing.<br> You need some money? Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.<br> Really? Joey doesn't have to give you money.<br> -TV stars have assistants, right? -That's an idea.<br> If I hire an assistant, would you take money from her? No, Joey.<br> Chandler could be your assistant.<br> He could answer your fan mail and stuff.<br> That would be great! Let's do that! I could use the money.<br> -Welcome aboard! -Okay! I need to use the bathroom.<br> Since I don't need assistance in there, take a break! All right.<br> -Hey.<br> -Hey, Phoebe.<br> Joey just hired Chandler.<br> That's so sweet.<br> Oh! Hang on! Hang on! Go! No.<br> No, no.<br> I said sell when it hits 50! Five-oh! It's a number! It comes after four-nine! No, it's okay.<br> It's okay.<br> You're allowed one mistake.<br> Just kidding.<br> You are fired.<br> Hey, Mon? Mon, look who I ran into! Oh, my God, Rachel! -God, you look terrific! -So do you! -Did you lose weight? -You are so sweet to notice.<br> I lost 3 1 2 pounds! You remember my friend Chandler? And that's Phoebe.<br> Sit down.<br> How long's it been since we've seen each other? Sean McMahan's party.<br> I played you one of my songs.<br> "Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.<br> " Oh, yeah.<br> Right.<br> -So, now, do you still do music? -Well, sometimes.<br> -Sometime I'll play you-- -Oh, my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives just walked in here! -Rach, he's a friend of ours.<br> -You're friends with Drake Ramoray? It's hard to be Drake's friend.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.<br> Hey, or I could bring my keyboard here sometime.<br> -He's coming over.<br> -Joey? I know.<br> Here, here.<br> No.<br> This is Rachel.<br> We went to high school together.<br> -Hi.<br> -Hi.<br> I love you on that show.<br> I watch you every day.<br> When you took out your kidney to save your ex-wife.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>even though she tried to kill you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> It's always nice to meet fans.<br> -She's not crazy, is she? -No.<br> So how you doing? Hang on.<br> Hang on.<br> Hang on.<br> Go! Who's this? You're gonna like working for me.<br> What's your name? What kind of name is Brindy? Stop talking.<br> All right, from now on your name is Joan.<br> You can pick your own last name.<br> -There you are.<br> -Uh-oh, it's my boss.<br> Here's a list of things for you to do today.<br> This'll be so great.<br> Thank you so much.<br> Gotta go to work.<br> I'm delivering twins, but only one is mine.<br> "Drop off my dry cleaning.<br> Pick up my vitamins.<br> " Teach me how to spell vitamins.<br> "Wear in my new jeans.<br> " You realize what you are, don't you? You're his bitch! No, no! No! Wait! You didn't sit on my Kit Kats did you? No, there was a little, little dip in the market.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I lost $1 3,000,000.<br> But the Kit Kats are all right? What am I gonna do? My office will kill me.<br> I can't call my clients, they'll kill themselves! -All right, now my chest hurts.<br> -What? My chest hurts.<br> -And now, I can't breathe.<br> -Are you having a heart attack? If I were, would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm? -Yes.<br> -Then, yes.<br> That is what I'm having.<br> Oh, my God! Come on, Pheebs, it's not that bad.<br> Most people'd be excited if they didn't work for two weeks.<br> Most people don't like their jobs.<br> I love my job.<br> I've been not working for three hours, and I'm already going crazy.<br> I miss Joan.<br> Honey, a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow down.<br> I always thought it was nature's way of telling you to die.<br> You're not gonna die.<br> I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today.<br> I wish I was dead.<br> Let's take a walk.<br> You should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine.<br> What's going on with you? Well, I've been doing a lot more of my karate.<br> -Still a dry spell with Carol? -Yeah.<br> How long has it been since you've had sex? -Well, last weekend.<br> .<br> .<br> -That's not so bad.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>will be two months.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>since I stopped trying.<br> You need to spice things up.<br> -What do you mean? -I don't know.<br> You could tie her up.<br> You could eat stuff off each other.<br> Dirty talk, mÃ©nage Ã  trois, toys.<br> Role-playing.<br> You're warden, she's prisoner.<br> -You're the pirate, she's the wench.<br> -Okay, I think I got it.<br> You could be two stockbrokers, rolling naked on the trading floor.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and everybody's watching.<br> It never happened.<br> And over there is Brady's Pub.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>where I unwind after a long day of "surgeoning.<br> " This is so amazing.<br> What else? Well, that is a large piece of television equipment.<br> And that is an old man.<br> -Hey, old man! -Hey.<br> Alrighty.<br> What do you say we head back to my place? You know, I would really love to, but I shouldn't.<br> Why? Why can't the world stop turning? Just for a moment.<br> Just for us.<br> Isn't that from the show? Yeah, but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I may have said those things before, but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I never truly meant them until now.<br> That's from the show too! Okay, you watch too much TV.<br> Here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.<br> Thanks.<br> There's pulp in that.<br> I thought we talked about this.<br> I don't like pulp.<br> No pulp.<br> Pulp isn't juice.<br> All juice.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I guess I just like the pulp.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I am being so rude.<br> Rachel, would you like a soda or something? Because Chandler will run right out and get it.<br> Yeah, well, sure, iced tea would be great.<br> Iced tea.<br> Okay.<br> Anything for you, sir? Did I not just tell him? Okay, look, Chandler, if this is gonna work.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you have got to listen.<br> You're gonna throw that juice at me? It's not all juice.<br> Honey, this morning was fun.<br> Me hopping in on you in the shower there? Yeah, maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.<br> Look, Carol, I was thinking maybe.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>maybe we can spice things up a little.<br> -What do you mean? -Carol, our sex life.<br> It's just not-- -Dad! -Hey there, little fella! Why don't we get some shoes on you? Show dad how you put your shoes on in your room.<br> Seriously, our sex life.<br> I was thinking maybe, I don't know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we could try some new things, you know, for fun.<br> -Like what? -Well, I don't know.<br> What if we were to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>tie each other up? Some people eat stuff off one another.<br> Yeah.<br> You know, we could try dirty talk.<br> -We could have a threesome.<br> -I love that idea! Who sold a story to "Archie Comics"? Oh, my God, that's so great.<br> You're a published writer.<br> I wish I had a present.<br> Wait a minute.<br> My last Kit Kat bar.<br> -You want to share it? -Okay! Chandler, I know you're mad.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I was a total jerk.<br> Completely over the line.<br> I just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I hate pulp.<br> You know how Monica feels about low-fat mayonnaise? It's not mayonnaise! Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, and here.<br> -What's this? -Fresh orange juice, with pulp.<br> -Just the way you like.<br> -Thanks, man.<br> Hey, Joey? Chandler sold a story to "Archie Comics.<br> " That's great! Congratulations! What's the story? You wouldn't care.<br> It's just a stupid comic book story.<br> Are you kidding me? I love Archie and the whole gang.<br> Well, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy.<br> But he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money.<br> So Reggie hires him as his assist-- --as his butler.<br> And makes him do crazy things.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Iike bring him milk shakes that can't have lumps.<br> Wait a minute.<br> That sounds a little familiar.<br> Did they already do that? I think I read it! Monica, listen.<br> I have to ask.<br> Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment.<br> -Does he do this with a lot of girls? -Yeah, a lot.<br> A lot, a lot.<br> And I'm one of them.<br> I just cannot believe this.<br> I mean, Joey Tribbiani.<br> It's none of my business, but aren't you married? Yeah.<br> I wish we could just not be married for a little bit.<br> You know, I just wish we could be, like, on a break.<br> Well, you're not.<br> It's easy for you.<br> You can have sex with whoever you want.<br> Yeah, I can.<br> Don't think I don't.<br> I do.<br> I mean, all the time.<br> You bet! Monica? You've done it, right? Of course I have.<br> What do you think, I'm like some 30-year-old virgin? Oh, my God.<br> You're a 30-year-old virgin.<br> Louder.<br> I don't think the guy in the back heard.<br> Yeah, I heard it.<br> It's not like I haven't had the opportunity.<br> I'm just waiting for the perfect guy.<br> I'm seeing this guy.<br> He's not perfect.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I'm thinking maybe I should get it over with.<br> You know, give him my flower.<br> Oh, my God, do it! Honey, you've waited long enough.<br> -You know what? You are right.<br> -Sex doesn't have to be a big deal.<br> There shouldn't be all these rules and restrictions.<br> People should be able to sleep with whoever, whenever-- Rachel.<br> I'll never think it's okay to cheat on your husband.<br> What do you know, virgin? Phoebe? Why is smoke coming out of the bathroom? The doctor said that could be one of the side effects.<br> Put the cigarette out.<br> No, it's not a cigarette.<br> The smoke is coming out of me! -Put it out.<br> -Okay, okay! -I'm so glad you're here.<br> -Come on.<br> Give it to me! -I got it.<br> -Give it! Hello? She can't come to the phone now.<br> Right.<br> No problem.<br> Okay, bye-bye.<br> Was it work? Was it Jack? Did he yell? No, just relax.<br> Nobody yelled.<br> Jack was making sure you were getting better.<br> Thank God.<br> Yeah, she's fired.<br> You've done all you can, Dr.<br> Wesley.<br> You've got to let her go.<br> Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.<br> Not so fast, Wesley.<br> Ramoray! That's right, Wesley.<br> Ijust stopped by to say that you're not a real doctor.<br> And that woman 's brain is fine.<br> Oh, thank God.<br> -Hope? Hope? -Drake.<br> You're not dying, Hope.<br> You're gonna live a long, healthy life.<br> With me.<br> Oh, Drake.<br> Okay.<br> Here we go.<br> Hi, Joey?
