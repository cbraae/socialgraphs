                    			Monica, that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever.<br> It was so good.<br> I think you killed us.<br> I couldn't possibly eat another bite.<br> I need something sweet.<br> Does anyone want to watch TV? Monica, your remote doesn't work.<br> You have to lift it and point.<br> Oh, forget it.<br> Let's play that game where everyone says one thing they're thankful for.<br> I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.<br> Very nice.<br> The other day, I was at the bus stop and this lovely fall breeze came and blew this chick's skirt up.<br> Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.<br> The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks It's not so much an underpant as a feat of engineering.<br> It's amazing how much they can do with so little material.<br> And they play with your mind.<br> Is it there? Is it not there? Are you aware that you're still talking? Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong? I don't know.<br> Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? And I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.<br> I'm sorry.<br> This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.<br> I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.<br> You can't swoop in with your bad marriage and take that away from me.<br> You're not going to tell about your parents' divorce again, are you? Come on! I want to hear it.<br> It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out.<br> It's a tradition, like the parade.<br> If the parade decided it was gay and abandoned its family.<br> Now, Chandler, dear just because we're getting a divorce doesn't mean we don't love you.<br> It just means he would rather sleep with the houseboy than with me.<br> More turkey, Mr.<br> Chandler? Every time you tell that story, that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.<br> So are he and your dad still together? No.<br> After they got their own place, the houseboy got his own houseboy.<br> Should have heard his accent.<br> You're right, yours is worse.<br> You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.<br> I've got one that's worse.<br> Really? Worse than, "More turkey, Mr.<br> Chandler?" Did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse! More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here? This man is In this life, Phoebe.<br> Oh, this life.<br> Oh, okay.<br> No, Chandler's is worse.<br> It must be cool remembering stuff like that.<br> I don't have any past-life memories.<br> Of course, you don't, sweetie.<br> You're brand-new.<br> I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.<br> Let's not tell this story.<br> I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head.<br> Joey got a turkey stuck on his head? It's not like it sounds.<br> It's exactly like it sounds.<br> What's going on? Oh, my God! I know! It's stuck! Step.<br> How did it get on? I put it on to scare Chandler.<br> Oh, my God! Monica's going to totally freak out! Help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.<br> Of course it smells bad.<br> You have your head up a dead animal's ass.<br> Did you get the turkey? Oh, my God! Who is that? It's Joey.<br> Is this supposed to be funny? It's not supposed to be funny.<br> It's supposed to be scary.<br> Get that off now! I can't.<br> It's stuck! It has to feed 20 people.<br> They're not going to eat it off your head! Hold on.<br> Let's just all think.<br> I got it! You pull.<br> I'll spread the legs as wide as I can.<br> Now is not the time.<br> Count to three.<br> One two three! It worked! I scared you! I knew it! I'm here, big guy.<br> Yeah, you are! I scared you! You did look like an idiot.<br> I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.<br> Remember when Ross tried to say "butternut squash" and it came out, "squatternut bosh"? Yeah, that's the same.<br> That's it.<br> That's my worst Thanksgiving.<br> That can't be the one Rachel meant.<br> She didn't even know that happened.<br> So, what's yours? I really don't want to tell this story.<br> Reliving pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving's all about.<br> For me, anyway.<br> And, of course, the lndians.<br> Of all people, you do not want me to tell this story.<br> What is that supposed to mean? -Monica, I think Rachel's here! -I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving! Not for me.<br> Chip and I broke up.<br> Why? What happened? My parents are out of town, and Chip was going to come over.<br> And you were going to give him your "flower.<br>" Monica, can you just call it sex? It really creeps me out when you call it that.<br> And by the way while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his "tenderness.<br>" Believe me.<br> Happy Thanksgiving.<br> Everyone this is Chandler.<br> My roommate and lead singer of our band.<br> This is Monica.<br> I'm Ross' little sister.<br> I'm so glad you could come.<br> We've got plenty of food, so I hope you're hungry.<br> Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.<br> I'm so glad you brought him here.<br> I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.<br> As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it.<br> Damn it! Does it feel weird around here now? You know, since I've been away at college? Not really.<br> That's cool.<br> So that's Rachel, the girl you've been writing all those songs about? Might want to rethink the lyrics to "She Feels Weird Since I've Been Gone.<br>" I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson! I am never going out with him again.<br> I don't care how much he begs.<br> His begging days are over, now that he's with Nancy Branson.<br> I've just had it with high-school boys.<br> They're just silly.<br> They're just silly, stupid boys.<br> I'll start dating men.<br> I'm sorry, Judy.<br> I couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for.<br> Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.<br> Did you like the macaroni and cheese? It was great.<br> You should be a chef.<br> Guess what.<br> All this stuff about Nancy being a slut was all a rumor.<br> Chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house! -That is so great! -I know.<br> Oh, gosh.<br> Listen, if you and Chip do it tonight promise me you'll tell me everything.<br> Totally.<br> It's not that big a deal.<br> We already kind of did it once.<br> But now you'll definitely know whether or not you did it.<br> I know.<br> And Chip promised that this time it'd last at least for an entire song.<br> I'm thinking of asking Rachel out tonight maybe playing her that song we wrote last week.<br> "Emotional Knapsack"? Right on! But don't take long.<br> We're testing our fake lD's tonight.<br> Right, Clifford Alvarez? Listen, Roland Cheng if things go well, I may be out with her all night.<br> Dude, don't do that to me.<br> It's cool, you can stay here.<br> My parents won't mind.<br> It's not that.<br> I just don't want to be stuck here with your fat sister.<br> Why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room in the fridge.<br> No, thank you.<br> Judy, you did it.<br> She's finally full! I called you fat? -I don't even remember that.<br> -Maybe it'd jog your memory if you guys played a little bit of "Emotional Knapsack.<br>" I'm so sorry.<br> I really am.<br> I was an idiot back then.<br> I rushed the stage at a Wham concert, for crying out loud! I can't believe you called her fat.<br> I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.<br> I am really sorry.<br> That is terrible.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> That's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.<br> Yes, it was.<br> No, it was actually Thanksgiving's over.<br> Let's get ready for Christmas.<br> I have the cutest Christmas story.<br> We want to hear Monica's story.<br> Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but, you know, whatever.<br> You changed your major again? I had to.<br> There was never any parking by the psychology building.<br> Love your new nose! Dr.<br> Wolfson's an artist.<br> He removed my mole cluster.<br> Want to see? No! Please, let me.<br> Happy Thanksgiving.<br> Your hair sure is different.<br> We were just talking about that.<br> We can't believe how stupid we used to look.<br> Where's Monica? She's upstairs.<br> Come down, everyone's here! Ross, Rachel and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.<br> Oh, my God! What's the matter? Is there something on my dress? You look so different.<br> Terrific.<br> That dress, that body.<br> -Dude! -Sorry.<br> Yes, she's thin.<br> It's wonderful.<br> But we really want to hear about Ross' new girlfriend.<br> Her name is Carol.<br> She's really pretty and smart.<br> She's on the lacrosse team and the golf team.<br> Can you believe it? She plays for both teams.<br> So I guess I'll see you at dinner.<br> -Dude! -Sorry.<br> Oh, my God! That was so awesome.<br> You got him back for calling you fat.<br> He was drooling all over you.<br> -That must have felt so great.<br> -lt didn't.<br> Yeah, I mean, I look great.<br> I feel great, and my heart's not in trouble anymore.<br> I just don't feel like I got him back.<br> I just want to humiliate him.<br> I want him to be naked, and I want to point at him and laugh.<br> That, we may be able to do.<br> How? Guys tend to get naked before they're going to have sex.<br> What? I didn't work this hard and lose weight just so I could give my flower to someone like him.<br> First of all, if you keep calling it that, no one will take it.<br> And then second of all, you're not going to have sex with him.<br> You'll just make him think that you are.<br> I'll throw him out in the yard, lock the door and all our neighbors will just humiliate him! You'll definitely get him back.<br> How do I make him think I want to have sex? Here's what you do.<br> Just act like everything around you turns you on.<br> What do you mean? Anything can be sexy.<br> Like this dish towel.<br> This feels so good against my cheek.<br> And if I get a little hot, I can just dab myself with it.<br> Or I can bring it down to my side and run it through my fingers while I talk to him.<br> I can do that.<br> Good, good, good.<br> Get busy.<br> He's coming.<br> Hey, what's up? Could you make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year? I'd love to.<br> I love macaroni and cheese.<br> I love the way this box feels against my cheek.<br> And I love carrots.<br> Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers.<br> Like this.<br> And hold them down here while I talk to you.<br> And, you know, if I get really hot I like to pick up this knife.<br> And I put the cool steel against my body.<br> Are you all right? I'm fine.<br> Twenty-year-old male.<br> He's got a severed toe on his right foot.<br> Could you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is.<br> Severed toe, you just said it! It says the knife went through your shoe.<br> They're made of wicker! Did you bring the toe? I have it right here on ice.<br> Toes on Ice, coming soon to Madison Square Garden.<br> Save your strength, man.<br> Don't worry, son.<br> We'll just reattach it and then.<br> What is it? You brought a carrot.<br> This isn't your toe.<br> This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.<br> You brought a carrot? Oh, my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.<br> I'm sorry! I'll go get it! All we can do now is sew up the wound.<br> Without my toe? I need my toe! I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.<br> I'm not falling for that one.<br> That's why I lost my toe? Because I called you fat? I didn't mean to cut it off.<br> It was an accident.<br> That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-a-lot? I'm sorry.<br> It wasn't your whole toe.<br> Yeah, well, I miss the tip.<br> It's the best part.<br> It has the nail.<br> Sir Limps-a-lot.<br> I came up with that.<br> You're a dork.<br> -I can't believe this.<br> -I said I was sorry.<br> "Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggy that cried all the way home.<br> It figures that something like this would happen today.<br> I hate this stupid day and everything about it! I'll see you later.<br> Wait.<br> Come here.<br> Is there anything I can do? Anything? Just leave me alone for a little while.<br> I'm a duck.<br> I go quack-quack.<br> I'm happy all the time.<br> Nice try.<br> Wait, wait, wait.<br> Look, Monica This is not going to work.<br> I bet this will work.<br> You're so great.<br> I love you.<br> Nothing.<br> I said you're so great, and then I just stopped talking.<br> You said you loved me.<br> I can't believe this! No, I didn't! Yes, you did! No, I didn't! You love me! No, I don't! Stop it, stop it, stop it! Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some more gauze? This is getting ridiculous.<br>   <br>
