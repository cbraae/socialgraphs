                    			Here you go, Pheebs.<br> Who wants one of my special home-baked brownies? I'll have one.<br> -That's okay.<br> -I'm not having one.<br> No, no.<br> It's just my tooth.<br> -All right.<br> -I'll have one.<br> So you need a dentist? I've got a good one.<br> Thanks.<br> I have a good one too.<br> I just can't see him.<br> See, that is the problem with invisible dentists.<br> Why can't you go to him? Because every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.<br> That's so weird.<br> Every time I go to the dentist.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I look down the hygienist's blouse.<br> What? First it was my Aunt Mary.<br> And then there was John, my mailman.<br> And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.<br> And all these people actually died? Yes.<br> While I was in the chair.<br> That's why I take care of my teeth.<br> It's not about oral hygiene.<br> I floss to save lives.<br> Come on, you didn't kill anybody.<br> These people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.<br> It's just a coincidence.<br> Tell that to them.<br> Oh, you can't! They're dead! The One With the Giant Poking Device .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) Thanks, Gunther.<br> Can I get a napkin too? Oh, like you don't already have everything.<br> You're in pain.<br> Would you just go to the dentist? Just go.<br> Fine.<br> But if you're my next victim.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>don't come back as a poltergeist who sucks me into the Tv set.<br> I promise.<br> Although, don't feel like you can't visit.<br> Hey, is Chandler here? No.<br> No, he's not.<br> You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.<br> What? What are you gonna do? How are you gonna tell Chandler? I was thinking about that.<br> I think the best way would be.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to not.<br> Joey, if you know about this, you have to tell him.<br> It'll kill him.<br> It'll just kill him.<br> Wait till I go to the dentist.<br> Maybe I'll kill him.<br> I think Naked Guy's using a hammock.<br> It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.<br> I'm going to the dentist.<br> So listen.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>just be on the lookout for anything that you could fall into.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>or that can fall on you.<br> .<br> .<br> : : :or: : : : All right, just look out! And I also just want to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I just want to tell you all that.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I have a problem.<br> I have to go into work for a few hours.<br> Some kids messed up the Homo sapien display.<br> What did they do? They painted over the word "sapien," for one thing.<br> Then they rearranged the figures.<br> Let's just leave it at that.<br> Do you want me to watch Ben for you? That's what I was gonna ask.<br> Thank you.<br> Wait, hello! What about me? You.<br> You want to watch Ben? That would be great! I just asked Monica.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because I know how empty her life is.<br> I got a science question.<br> If the Homo sapiens were, in fact, "homo" sapiens.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is that why they're extinct? Joey, Homo sapiens are people.<br> Hey, I'm not judging.<br> Look, Benny! Spoon! Spoon! Come on.<br> All right, you know what? I think he's bored.<br> Here.<br> You wanna play the airplane game? You wanna show Rachel? Come here.<br> You wanna do something fun? Okay.<br> You're so brave.<br> You're so brave! Yes, you are.<br> -You're so brave.<br> -You're okay.<br> He's fine.<br> Let's just put him down.<br> Come here, babe.<br> Yes, you're such a good boy.<br> How could you do that to him?! Ross trusted me! What's he gonna say? Nothing, because we're not telling him.<br> -We're not? -No.<br> All right, I like that.<br> So we're okay.<br> We're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay.<br> There's a bump.<br> What bump? Oh, my God! Well, push it in! Push it in! I cannot push it in! Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.<br> That's it.<br> I got it! The second Ross walks in.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>take him to your bedroom and do whatever you do.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that makes him go "rheeeee! " Or.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we could put a hat on his head.<br> A hat! Yes! We need a hat! Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat? I'll get Rainy Day Bear! Because he'll know what to do? Oh, my God.<br> You're a genius! It's kind of sewn on.<br> Give it.<br> Give it.<br> It's just like a bloodbath in here today! Hey, hold on a second.<br> Hold on a second.<br> Do you think these pearls are nice? I'd prefer a mountain bike.<br> Janice's birthday's coming.<br> I wanna get her something special.<br> -Come in here with me.<br> -Wait! You wanna get her something special? Get her flowers.<br> Get her candy.<br> Get her gum.<br> Girls love gum.<br> That's a good idea.<br> "Dear Janice: Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday.<br> " I'd like to get her something serious.<br> You want something serious.<br> You know what you should do? You should get her one of those.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>barium enemas.<br> Those are dead serious.<br> Look, I'm gonna go in here.<br> And you don't buy me anything, ever! You can't! You can't.<br> You can't buy her pearls.<br> You just can't, you can't, you can't! Why not? Oh, God.<br> Here's the thing.<br> This is the thing.<br> Okay, the thing is-- What is the thing? I went down to the Mattress King's showroom.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.<br> What? They were in his office.<br> She wouldn't do that.<br> She's with me.<br> I'm telling you, I saw it.<br> Well, you're wrong.<br> You're wrong.<br> I'm not wrong.<br> I wish I was.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now.<br> It makes more sense as an ensemble.<br> And it takes the focus off the hat.<br> Oh! You're alive! You're alive! I promised you no one would die, didn't l? We'll see about that.<br> Can I use your phone to call everyone I know? Sure.<br> We have no money.<br> Go ahead.<br> Hey, you're not dead! Okay, see you.<br> Monica.<br> Oh, my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that? Monica bang! Okay, I heard that.<br> Did he just say, "Monica bang"? Oh, my God! He's gonna rat me out! Monica bang! Sweetie, you need to stop saying that now.<br> It's no big deal.<br> It's not even worth mentioning.<br> You see? We all do it all the time.<br> See? Watch this.<br> Monica bang! Everybody bang! Ben bang! Rachel bang! Bang, Rachel! Bang! -Oh, isn't it fun? -Look at that! We all do it! -Okay, I'm stopping now.<br> -Are you okay? You know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.<br> How's my Bing-a-ling? I don't know.<br> You tell me.<br> Anything you want to tell me? Because if you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You should-- You would tell me.<br> Why are your eyes so wide? You tell me.<br> Maybe it's because I was just fooling around with my ex.<br> Oh, no.<br> That was you! Oh, my God! -All right! -How did you know? Joey told me.<br> He saw you two kissing.<br> In the park? No.<br> In his office.<br> How many kisses were there? Just those two! Why? Why was there kissing? There should be no kissing! Oh, I'm sorry, honey.<br> I'm so, so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I'm so, so sorry.<br> I just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> What happened was l.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I can't breathe.<br> Can you get me a bag or something? Here.<br> Here.<br> It's the receipt.<br> I'll take it.<br> Look, I've got to know.<br> Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right, look.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'm gonna need an actual answer here, okay? So which is it? Him or me? I don't know.<br> Okay, if you're alive, you answer your phone! Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream before dinner.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>if you won't tell him about our little bonking incident.<br> Number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery.<br> And number two, l-- What? You said "number two.<br> " I also said "number one.<br> " I know.<br> Hey, everyone! How's my little boy? He's perfect.<br> Aren't you, Ben? -He's never been better.<br> -What did you do, take him whaling? Monica.<br> Oh, my God! He just said your name! That's great! Good job, Ben! Monica bang! That's right.<br> That's what I'd sound like if I exploded.<br> The curse is broken! I called everybody I know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and everyone is alive! Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.<br> My God, I killed another one! The curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.<br> Maybe he's just taking a nap.<br> I'm telling you, he hasn't moved since this morning.<br> We should call somebody.<br> Tell them the naked guy we stare at isn't moving? We've got to find out if he's alive.<br> How are we gonna do that? There's no way.<br> Well, there is one way.<br> His window's open.<br> I say.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we poke him.<br> You know how we save all those chopsticks.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>for no reason when we get Chinese food? Well, now we got a reason.<br> What? We're fashioning a very long poking device.<br> All right.<br> Hey, what's the matter? I talked to Janice.<br> Oh, my God.<br> Is she going back to him? She doesn't know.<br> Says she loves us both.<br> I woke up this morning, I was in love.<br> I was happy! It serves me right for buying that 1 2-pack of condoms.<br> And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the receipt! What are you gonna do? I don't know.<br> You know? What would you do? It doesn't matter what I'd do.<br> Come on.<br> Come on.<br> Tell me.<br> All right.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you probably won't want to hear this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but if it was me, and this is just me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I'd bow out.<br> What? What are you talking about? They have a kid together.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>you know? They're, like, a family.<br> And if, I don't know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>if there's a chance they can make that work.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way.<br> You okay? You wanna come poke a nude guy? Well, he's finally asleep.<br> About that bump on his head.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Are you sure it's a new bump? No offense, but I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.<br> It's okay if he bumps his head.<br> Kids bump their heads all the time.<br> It was your first time babysitting.<br> You did your best.<br> I did! I know.<br> You just have to watch them all the time.<br> I did! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing! Monica did it? Did you notice anything weird about Ben today? No, why? I was just playing with him, and we were doing the "Alphabet Song" .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>which he's good at.<br> But he left out "E" and "F.<br> " It's like they just, I don't know, fell out of his head.<br> Really? Oh, and also, he's walking.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>kind of funny.<br> It's like his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg.<br> Yeah, he's in there, just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby! I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.<br> You jerk! -You know how much I love that kid! -Monica bang! Monica bang! I'll get the hat.<br> I have something to tell you.<br> And I want you to let me get through it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it's not gonna be easy.<br> I think you should go back with Gary.<br> I don't want to be the guy that breaks up a family.<br> You know, when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.<br> Whenever I'd see him, I'd always think.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> "You're the reason.<br> You are why they're not together.<br> " And I hated that guy.<br> And it didn't matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad.<br> It's the right thing to do.<br> You're right.<br> Oh, God.<br> But before I can say goodbye.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>there's something I really need you to know.<br> The way I feel about you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it's like I finally understand.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>what Lionel Ritchie's been singing about.<br> You know? I mean, what we have.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it's like movie love.<br> You're my soul mate.<br> I can't believe we're not gonna spend the rest of our lives together.<br> Then don't leave me.<br> What? Forget what I said! I was babbling! Pick me! No, you were right! I gotta give my marriage another chance.<br> No, you don't! I say you have to give your divorce another chance! I'm sorry.<br> Don't go.<br> No, I gotta go.<br> Honey.<br> Honey.<br> -People are looking.<br> -I don't care.<br> I don't care! Yeah, okay.<br> I'm leaving now.<br> You can't leave! I have your shoe! Goodbye, Chandler Bing.<br> Rachel has those in burgundy.<br> Remember, something this big and long will be very difficult to maneuver.<br> Fortunately, I have experience in that area.<br> Can we please focus here? A naked man's life hangs in the balance.<br> I'm telling you, he's dead.<br> What we're about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick! All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke.<br> Steady.<br> Steady.<br> Okay, a little higher.<br> Careful of the angle.<br> Okay, okay.<br> We're approaching the window.<br> Thread the needle.<br> Thread the needle.<br> He's alive!
