"New Doc on the Block, Days of our Lives Joey Tribbiani.<br>" Cool picture! Oh, I look good.<br> Is this true? That you write a lot of your own lines? Well, kind of, yeah.<br> Remember last week when Alex was in the accident? The line in the script was  "If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.<br>" But I made it, "If this woman doesn't get to a hospital she's not gonna live.<br>" Oh, okay.<br> I see what you did there.<br> Aren't you afraid the writers will be kind of mad when they read this? I never thought about the writers.<br> The scripts just come to my house.<br> But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good which makes the writers look good.<br> So how could they be mad? Makes up most of his lines.<br> Son of a.<br> Write this, jerk-weed.<br> I fall down an elevator shaft? What does this mean? I fall down an elevator shaft? I don't know.<br> I just bring the scripts.<br> They can't kill me! I'm Francesca's long-lost son! Right.<br> Could you sign? No! No way! I'm not signing that! I don't think that will affect the plot of the show.<br> How can they do this to me? All right, I'm just gonna go.<br> Sorry.<br> Well, it wasn't that many guys.<br> If you consider how many guys there actually are it's a very small percentage.<br> It's not that big a deal.<br> I was just curious.<br> -Good night.<br> -Good night, Richard.<br> Good luck, Mon.<br> Before I tell you, you tell me how many women you've been with.<br> Two.<br> Two? Two? How is that possible? I mean  have you seen you? I mean, what can I say? I was married to Barbara for 30 years, my high-school sweetheart.<br> Now you.<br> That's two.<br> Two it is.<br> Time for bed.<br> I'm gonna brush my teeth.<br> No, wait a minute now! Come on, it's your turn.<br> Oh, come on! You know, I don't need the actual number.<br> Just a ballpark.<br> Okay, it is definitely less than a ballpark.<br> I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.<br> Tell me about it.<br> So what's your magic number? Come on, you know everyone I've been with.<br> All both of them.<br> Well, there's you.<br> Better not be doing these in order.<br> Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.<br> Barry.<br> Paolo.<br> Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.<br> Honey, are you jealous of Paolo? I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.<br> -Really? -Oh, please! That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.<br> All it really was was just meaningless, animal sex.<br> Okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.<br> I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.<br> That's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.<br> This is nuts! Crazy! She came over for two minutes dropped off a fish tank and left! Where's Buddy? Buddy? My fish, Buddy.<br> There was no fish when she dropped it off.<br> This is unbelievable! You sleep with my ex-girlfriend, insult my intelligence by lying then you kill my fish? My Buddy? I didn't kill your fish! Look, Eddie Would you look at what I'm doing? Now that can't be smart.<br> So we're just gonna take this guy right off you and put him here in Mr.<br> Pocket.<br> Tangelo? That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me? Well, that's not bad at all.<br> You had me thinking it was, like, a fleet.<br> You're okay with it? Oh, honey, I'm fine.<br> Okay, about that two.<br> What? All right.<br> What about my two? It just seems like a really small number.<br> Right.<br> Don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh, my God! Am I an oat? Honey, you are not an oat.<br> I don't know, I guess I'm just not an oat guy.<br> I've only slept with women I love.<br> You've only slept with two people.<br> Right.<br> You know I love you too, right? Now I do.<br> Ross, please listen to me.<br> You are so much better for me than Paolo ever was.<br> You care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.<br> If I make you laugh, here's an idea.<br> Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack and I'll stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes! What we have is special! All Paolo and I ever had was "Animal sex"? So what are you saying? There's nothing between us "animal" at all? There's not even, like, a little animal? Not even, like chipmunk sex? Try to hear me, okay? I'm not gonna lie to you.<br> -lt was good with Paolo.<br> -Knock-knock.<br> But what you and I have is so much better.<br> We have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.<br> You know? I swear.<br> This is the best  I have ever had.<br> Until now.<br> Richard told me he loved me.<br> -Oh, my God! -I know! Honey, that's great! I know! -I just can't find -Top drawer.<br> -Hurry.<br> -Why? You need one too? Found them! There's only one.<br> We'll be right there.<br> We're just trying to decide something.<br> -They're trying to decide something.<br> -Good.<br> Good, good.<br> So was your mustache Did it used to be different? How do you, you know, keep it so neat? I have a comb.<br> -What is that? -A mustache comb.<br> Thank you.<br> Okay, I will do your laundry for one month.<br> I will, I will, I will.<br> I will clean the apartment for two months.<br> I'll give this to you now, if you tell me where we keep the dustpan.<br> So were you in Nam? We are both adults here.<br> We must got some way to solve this.<br> -Rock, paper, scissors? -Gotcha.<br> One, two, three.<br> Yes! Fine.<br> Go have sex.<br> No! You have got it completely wrong! John Savage was Deer Hunter, no legs.<br> Jon Voight was Coming Home, couldn't feel his legs.<br> You've got it totally the other way around, my friend.<br> Jon Voight -Honey? -What? Shall we? It's not gonna happen.<br> They're doing it tonight.<br> We can do it tomorrow.<br> In the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand.<br> So when I woke up this morning  he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes! Why? He thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.<br> Why would you kill his fish? Because sometimes after you sleep with someone you have to kill a fish.<br> Chandler, honey  I'm sorry.<br> Can we watch Joey's show now, please? Wait.<br> He's not here yet.<br> He knows what happens.<br> I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.<br> Amber I'll always be there for you as a friend and as your brother.<br> Oh, Drake.<br> Hard day, huh? First the medical award, now this? Some guys are just lucky, I guess.<br> Dr.<br> Ramoray, report to first floor Emergency stat.<br> Well, then  I guess that's me.<br> Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr.<br> Horton? Dr.<br> Wall? They only said you.<br> Oh, okay.<br> All right.<br> I love you.<br> Yeah, whatever.<br> Oh, no! Drake, look out! -Did they just kill off Joey? -No! Now maybe.<br> Come on! Open up! We want to talk to you! I don't feel like talking! Come on! We care about you.<br> -We're worried about you.<br> -And some of us really have to pee! I'm sorry, Joey.<br> Listen, sorry about your death.<br> That really sucks.<br> -We came over as soon as we saw.<br> -How could you not tell us? I don't know.<br> I was kind of hoping no one would ever find out.<br> Well, maybe they could find a way to bring you back.<br> They said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor who could've saved me was me.<br> It's supposed to be some kind of irony.<br> But Joey, you're gonna be fine.<br> You don't need that show.<br> It was just a dumb soap opera.<br> This was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.<br> Yes! I was going to incorporate that.<br> Here's Monica.<br> She'll have something nice to say.<br> I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.<br> What? To me, that's nice.<br> It'll be okay.<br> You know that.<br> No, I don't.<br> It's like you work your whole life for something and you think that when you get it it'll never be as good as you thought.<br> But this so was.<br> It changed everything.<br> Like, the other day, I got this credit card application and I was pre-approved! I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life! I'm sorry, man.<br> I don't know if this'll mean anything to you  but you'll always be pre-approved with us.<br> That means nothing to me.<br> Pecan sandy? Just made them.<br> Yeah, all right.<br> Are these raisins? Sure, why not? Listen, Eddie.<br> I've been thinking about our living situation.<br> Why are you smiling? I got a little surprise.<br> Look.<br> There's a new fishy.<br> I named him  Chandler, you know, after you.<br> Well, that's not even a real fish.<br> No, that's a Goldfish cracker.<br> So what's your point, man? Okay, good night.<br> You big freak of nature! -Brisk tonight.<br> -Oh, man.<br> -Let's never speak of this.<br> -You got it.<br>   <br>
