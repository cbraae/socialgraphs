I am trapped in an A TM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.<br> Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium.<br> Yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot.<br> I' m fine.<br> I' m just stuck at the bank in an ATM vestibule.<br> Jill says vestibule, I'm going with vestibule.<br> I' m fine.<br> No, l' m not alone.<br> I don't know, some guy.<br> Oh, some guy.<br> I am some guy.<br> Jill, I saw you with some guy last night.<br> Yes, he was some guy.<br> Hey, everyone.<br> Officiating at tonight's blackout is Rabbi T ribbiani.<br> Chandler's old roommate was Jewish.<br> These are our only candles.<br> So happy Hanukkah! Look! Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.<br> That had to hurt! All right, all right! It's been 14 1/2 minutes and you still haven 't said one word.<br> God! Do something! Just make contact.<br> Smile! There you go.<br> You 're definitely scaring her.<br> Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.<br> Mom.<br> Mom, you' re tripping! Dexter's a dog.<br> The blackout's scaring him.<br> You'd pee in Dad's shoes too if you didn't know.<br> All right, call me back.<br> -Mothers.<br> -Yeah.<br> Attaboy! A word.<br> That wasn 't so hard.<br> Mothers.<br> Yeah! Mothers.<br> Yeah! Perfect.<br> Don 't smile.<br> Would you like to call somebody? Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.<br> Yeah, thanks.<br> -Hello? -It's me.<br> -It's Chandler.<br> Are you okay? -Yeah, l' m fine.<br> I' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.<br> -What? -l' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.<br> I have no idea what you said.<br> Put Joey on the phone.<br> -What's up, man? -l' m stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Oh, my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.<br> Like that thought never entered my mind.<br> -Okay.<br> -Somebody.<br> -I'll go.<br> I'll go.<br> -Okay.<br> Senior year of college, on a pool table.<br> -Pool table? -That's my sister.<br> Okay, my weirdest place would have to be the women's room of the New York City Public Library.<br> Oh, my God! What were you doing in a library? -Pheebs, what about you? -Oh, Milwaukee.<br> It's a really weird place.<br> Ross? Disneyland, 1 989.<br> " It's a small world after all.<br> " No way.<br> The ride broke down so Carol and I went behind those mechanical Dutch children.<br> We were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.<br> Let's see, that leaves.<br> -Rachel? -Come on, I already went.<br> -You did not go.<br> -I did.<br> T ell us.<br> Come on.<br> All right, the weirdest place would have to be the foot of the bed.<br> -Step back! -We have a winner! This must be what the fridge looks like with the door closed.<br> Spooky.<br> Anybody hungry? We got a Klondikesoup.<br> I've never had a relationship with that kind of passion.<br> Where you have to have somebody even in a theme park.<br> It was the only thing to do that didn't have a line.<br> Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.<br> -Come on.<br> -No.<br> He said we held up the people behind us.<br> You didn't marry him because? Do you think there are people that go through life  never having that kind of? -Probably.<br> -Really? I'll tell you something.<br> Passion is way overrated.<br> -Yeah, right.<br> -lt is.<br> Eventually, it kind of burns out.<br> But hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and.<br> In my ex-wife's case, lesbianism.<br> For those people who miss out on that passion thing there's other stuff.<br> -Okay.<br> -But I don't think that'll be you.<br> -You don't? -See, I see - big passion in your future.<br> -Really? -You do? -I do.<br> Ross, you' re so great.<br> It's never gonna happen.<br> -What? -You and Rachel.<br> What? Me and Ra? Why not? You waited too long to make your move and now you' re in the "friend zone.<br> " -l' m not in the zone.<br> -No, Ross.<br> You' re mayor of the zone.<br> Look, l' m taking my time, all right? I' m laying the groundwork.<br> Every day I get a little bit closer to Priesthood! I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking.<br> She just ran her fingers through my hair.<br> -Were you missing that interaction? -No, no, no.<br> This is running fingers through your hair, okay? Now this is a tousle.<br> If you don't ask her out soon, you'll be in the zone forever.<br> I will, I will.<br> I'm waiting for the right moment.<br> What? -What, now? -Yeah.<br> What's messing you up? The wine? The moonlight? You gotta go up to her and say, " Look, Rachel, l" -What? -We' re shushing  because we' re trying to hear something.<br> -What? What? -Don't you hear that? See? -Would you like gum? -ls it sugarless? -Sorry, it's not.<br> -Then no, thanks.<br> What was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it.<br> If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it! New York City has no power And the milk is getting sour But to me it is not scary Because I stay away from dairy -Here goes.<br> -You'll do it? -I'll do it.<br> -Want help? You come out, you' re a dead man.<br> -Good luck, man.<br> -Thanks.<br> -Okay.<br> -Okay.<br> Where you going? You can't go out there.<br> -Why not? -Because of the reason.<br> -That would be? -I can't tell you.<br> Joey, what's going on? You gotta promise you'll never tell Ross that I told you.<br> -What? -He's planning your birthday party.<br> -Oh, my God! I love him! -You better act surprised.<br> -About what? -My surprise party.<br> -What surprise party? -Oh, stop it.<br> Joey already told me.<br> He didn't tell me.<br> Don't look at me.<br> This is Ross' thing.<br> This is typical.<br> I'm always the last to know.<br> You are not.<br> We tell you stuff.<br> I was the last one to know when Chandler got bit by the peacock.<br> I was the last to know you had a crush on Joey.<br> What? Looks like I was second to last.<br> You had a crush on me? All right.<br> It wasn't a crush, it was a dent.<br> Big dent? You were moving your furniture.<br> I thought you had nice arms.<br> Nice arms, huh? Hey, Mon, l' m moving the chair.<br> Do anything for you? With all the lights out you can actually see the stars.<br> It's so nice.<br> I have a question.<br> Actually, it's not so much a question.<br> It's more of a general wondering.<br> ment.<br> -Okay.<br> -Okay.<br> Here it goes.<br> Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to.<br> -Yes, that's right.<br> -Look at that little kitty! What? Top of the world Looking down on creation And the only explanation I can find Is the love that I found Ever since you 've been around All right, this is just Bactine.<br> It won't hurt.<br> -Ow! -Sorry, that was wax.<br> Poor little T ooty's scared.<br> We should find his owner.<br> Why not put poor T ooty in the hall? During a blackout? She'll get trampled.<br> Yeah? Damage control.<br> Get back to the gum.<br> Gum would be perfection.<br> Gum would be perfection? Gum would be perfection.<br> Could've said, "Gum would be nice.<br> " But, no.<br> For me, gum is perfection.<br> I loathe myself! Oh, no, they' re nuns.<br> They hate all living things.<br> Hi.<br> We just found this cat, and we' re looking for the owner.<br> Yeah, it's mine.<br> -He seems to hate you.<br> Are you sure? -It's my cat.<br> Give me my cat.<br> -Wait a minute.<br> What's his name? -Bob Buttons.<br> -Bob Buttons? -Bob Buttons.<br> Here, Bob Buttons.<br> You are a very bad man! You owe me a cat.<br> Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.<br> Here, kitty, kitty.<br> Where did you go, little kitty? IKitty, kitty, kitty.<br> Come here, kitty, kitty.<br> -Hi.<br> -Buona sera.<br> Wow! Mon, wanna go for a ride in my racecar? I'll bring my arms.<br> We can bring my wheelbarrow for your teeth! Come on, lucky sixes! Everybody, this is Paolo.<br> Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.<br> This is Monica -Hi.<br> -and Joey -Hi.<br> -and Ross.<br> Hi.<br> He doesn't speak much English.<br> Monopoly! Look at that! So, where did Paolo come from? Italy, I think.<br> No, I mean tonight.<br> Suddenly, into our lives.<br> That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat.<br> Isn't that funny? That is funny.<br> And Rachel keeps touching him.<br> I looked all over and couldn't find the kitty anywhere.<br> I found him.<br> It was Paolo's cat.<br> Well, there you go.<br> Last to know again.<br> And I'm guessing, this is Paolo? Paolo, this is Phoebe.<br> You betcha! All right.<br> Okay.<br> What next? Blow a bubble.<br> A bubble's good.<br> It's got a boyish charm.<br> It's impish.<br> Here we go.<br> Nice going, imp!

And now you 're choking.<br> You all right? My God! You' re choking! -Better? -Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> That was.<br> -That was.<br> -Perfection? That was no tousle.<br> -What'd he say that was so funny? -I have absolutely no idea.<br> That's classic.<br> My God, you guys! What am I doing? This is so un-me! If you want, I'll do it.<br> I just wanna bite his bottom lip.<br> But I won't.<br> The first time he smiled at me those seconds were more exciting than weeks with Barry.<br> Did you rent mopeds? Because I've heard Oh, it's not about that right now.<br> I know it's superficial, and we have nothing in common and we don't even speak the same language, but, God! -Paolo, hi.<br> -Ross.<br> Listen.<br> Listen, something you should know.<br> Rachel and I are.<br> We' re kind of a thing.<br> -Thing? -Thing.<br> Yes, thing.<br> -You have the sex? -No.<br> No, technically the sex is not being had.<br> But that's.<br> But that's not the point.<br> The point is that Rachel and I should be.<br> Well, Rachel and l should be together.<br> And if you get in the -ln bed -No.<br> No, not where I was going.<br> If you get in the way of us becoming a thing then I would be, well, very sad.<br> So, do you? -So you do know a little English? -Little.<br> -Do you know the word "crap-weasel "? -No.<br> That's funny.<br> You are a huge crap-weasel.<br> We've been doing this for an hour.<br> It's easy.<br> Ready?
