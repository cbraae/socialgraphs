                    			Okay, this is it.<br> You sure you wanna do this? Hello, Mrs.<br> Ross.<br> Well, hello, Mr.<br> Rachel.<br> -Whoa! -Oh, my God! Come on, Pheebs, hurry! Okay! Okay! Oh, my God! ls everybody getting married? No running in the chapel.<br> Hey, don't you give me any of your-- Hey! Why are you here? Ross and Rachel left a message.<br> They're getting married.<br> -Isn't that why you guys are here? -Yes.<br> Why else would we be here? What happened? Did we miss it? We missed it.<br> Maybe you wouldn't have if you could run in the chapel! This is insane.<br> What's the big deal? It's not like it's a real marriage.<br> What? If you marry in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.<br> If you marry here, you're married everywhere.<br> Really? Yeah.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, well.<br> The One After Vegas Gelula/SDI Why are we in bed together? I don't know.<br> Do you have any clothes on? Yes.<br> -Really? -No.<br> But we didn't have.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>sex, did we? I don't remember much about last night.<br> It was such a blur.<br> I remember laughing.<br> I laughed a lot.<br> Then we didn't have sex.<br> Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.<br> I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.<br> Tell me about it.<br> Morning, Pheebs.<br> Well, my movie has been officially canceled.<br> Joey, I'm so sorry.<br> You want my breakfast? Too depressed to eat.<br> I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.<br> I'll fly home with you.<br> What time is your flight? -What about my cab? -I don't need that anymore.<br> You borrowed my cab.<br> You have to drive it back.<br> I don't wanna drive back by myself.<br> I get lonely.<br> How about if you come with me? -It's a long trip.<br> -That would be great.<br> We could talk and play games.<br> This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship.<br> Are you asking me to have a "frienaissance"? Sure? All right, although I don't think we need one.<br> I never stopped loving you.<br> So has anybody talked to Dr.<br> and Mrs.<br> Geller yet? They left me a message.<br> They'll be here.<br> Where is the waitress? I'm starving.<br> It's a buffet, man.<br> Here's where I win all my money back! I gotta talk to you.<br> Sure.<br> What's up? Monica and I almost got married.<br> My God! That's huge! Wait a minute.<br> Why wasn't I invited? And who was gonna be your best man? Don't say Ross.<br> Do not say Ross.<br> I just don't think that Monica and I are ready yet.<br> I love her.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but seeing Ross and Rachel come out of that chapel.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>was like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast, you know.<br> How do I tell her without crushing her? Tell her she's not marriage material.<br> What? Girls say it to me all the time.<br> And if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.<br> How do I tell him that it's too soon? He's gonna think I don't love him anymore.<br> -Well, you don't.<br> -Yes, I do.<br> Good.<br> I was just testing you.<br> -Hey.<br> -Oh, hi.<br> We were just talking about bacon.<br> No, we were talking about tennis.<br> Tennis is more believable.<br> Thank you.<br> Coffee.<br> What? Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? What do you mean "Iast night"? Nothing happened last night.<br> Ross invited us all to watch.<br> We weren't gonna miss our friends marrying.<br> Who got married? You did.<br> What? -Hello.<br> We didn't get married.<br> -No, we didn't.<br> That's ridi-- Wait, wait, wait.<br> I remember being in a chapel.<br> They would not let us get married when we were that drunk.<br> They let you get married.<br> Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk.<br> Now, I'm drunk right now.<br> I can't have a mimosa with breakfast? I'm on vacation.<br> What are you gonna do? Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer.<br> Well, I think, I think Ross already has one.<br> Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two.<br> Laugh it up, but the joke's on you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because we don't need to get divorced.<br> -We're just gonna get an annulment.<br> -An annulment? Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here.<br> Oh, that's your thing! What? Your thing, that you're the guy who gets divorced.<br> No, no, that's not "my thing.<br> " I do not love getting divorced.<br> Yes, you do.<br> This is your third divorce.<br> You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it.<br> I'm so drunk.<br> -So what should we do? -I don't know.<br> I know I love you.<br> I know I love you.<br> Where are we on the whole "going back.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>to where they have the marriages" thing? I love you.<br> That's a good question.<br> Last night we let the dice decide.<br> We should leave it up to fate again.<br> I love you! We don't get married unless there's a sign.<br> So say.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You roll another eight, then there's a sign.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>that we should marry.<br> Eight we get married.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 1 0, Sounds great.<br> Hey, we got a shooter.<br> Money, please.<br> -Ready? -Ready.<br> Come on, eight.<br> Yes, yes, eight.<br> Eight, easy eight.<br> -I can't believe I rolled an eight.<br> -That was so unlikely.<br> Let's get married.<br> I guess.<br> Last night I rolled a hard eight.<br> It was the wrong kind of eight.<br> No wedding! Damn it! I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack? We're doing the right thing.<br> Of course we are.<br> We left it up to fate.<br> If we were supposed to get married, there would be a sign.<br> Okay, you have 1 9 questions left.<br> Use them wisely.<br> Come on, Joey.<br> You can't win if you don't ask any questions! What? You promised me a fun road trip.<br> We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 1 /2.<br> We are switching, and you are going to drive back.<br> That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper! All right.<br> And until then, you are going to sing to me.<br> Because the radio's broken, and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice.<br> -Really? -Sing! I wanna rock 'n ' roll all night Man, this is a long drive.<br> Are my eyes open? No! Morning.<br> Hey.<br> Hey, hubby.<br> Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing.<br> Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.<br> Okay.<br> So we'll just stay married.<br> Yes, exactly.<br> And I will make everyone call me Mrs.<br> Geller.<br> Wow, this is so amazing.<br> I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.<br> Now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.<br> I'm not kidding.<br> Look.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I can't have three failed marriages.<br> I can't, okay? I am not gonna be that guy.<br> So what, we just stay married forever? How is this going to affect you, really? I mean, you fill some form out once in a while.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>instead of checking the box "Miss," you check the box that says, "Mrs.<br> " It's right next to it.<br> Okay.<br> I'm sorry, you're right.<br> You know what? We can stay married.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because I thought that the boxes were far away from each other.<br> All right.<br> Look, just.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>please take a moment here.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and think about what you're asking of me.<br> Okay? I am asking you to do me a favor.<br> You are asking me to be your wife.<br> And, as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor.<br> That kid kicked me really hard.<br> Well, you did pull his hair.<br> -He took my snack.<br> -I'm not getting into this again.<br> All right, you know what? Hurts really bad.<br> Well, I told you not to walk.<br> Here.<br> There.<br> There.<br> Okay.<br> -This doesn't mean anything, does it? -No.<br> How could you pick up a hitchhiker? He could be a rape-- He could be a rapist or a killer or something.<br> Don't you think I asked him that before he got in? I'm not talking to you.<br> You go back to sleep.<br> And, you, are you a rapist? No.<br> Do you like car games? Yeah, you know the license plate game? I love the license plate game! I'll play.<br> I'll play.<br> No, you need your sleep.<br> Night-night.<br> Listen.<br> I know you wanted to talk to me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married.<br> We register.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you get to keep all the presents.<br> No, Ross, come on.<br> No, listen.<br> I've thought about how to tell you this.<br> The bottom line, Ross.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is, we cannot stay married.<br> -I don't know if that's true-- -Oh, but it is.<br> Okay.<br> You know what this is? This is a difference of opinion.<br> -When that happens in a marriage-- -Ross, come on! This is not a marriage! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will.<br> All right.<br> All right, I'll do it.<br> Thank you.<br> Hey, hey.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is there any such thing as an annulment shower? There's the train station, where I get off.<br> I have your address and phone number.<br> I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter.<br> So ball's pretty much in your court.<br> All right.<br> See you, Pheebs.<br> Come on, Pheebs, I can't take this anymore.<br> Please talk to me.<br> Let me make it up to you.<br> Ground control to Major Tom Commencing countdown Engines on Take your protein pills And put your helmet on -This is-- -Stop it! Stop it! No! That's not fair.<br> You know I can't resist that beautiful voice.<br> Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.<br> I promised you a fun road trip with your friend.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I didn't deliver, okay? Now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship.<br> So I will strive to stay awake for as long as I know you.<br> You can still sleep at night and stuff.<br> Thank you.<br> So can we play 20 Questions now? I got a good one.<br> I thought about it since Kansas.<br> Okay.<br> Is it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>a kind of hot sandwich? Yes.<br> Is it a meatball sub? That is incredible! You are the master! Bug! -You look like you're-- -Don't say it! Don't even think it.<br> All right.<br> Chandler, enjoy your handful.<br> Should we just get married? All the signs are telling us to do it.<br> I'm sick of the signs.<br> -I'm happy the way things are.<br> -Me too.<br> -I don't want change, do you? -No.<br> Then nothing changes! Everything stays the same! Go unpack.<br> It's been three days, and it drives me insane! Jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar-- You know, I was thinking what if l.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>unpack here? All your stuff would be here.<br> Well.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> What if all my stuff was here? Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.<br> Doesn't make any sense.<br> Okay.<br> What if we live together, and you get what I'm saying? Live together? There've been no signs for that.<br> Me asking is kind of a sign.<br> Yes! Yes! Yes! Okay.<br> Okay, wait.<br> Wait, wait, wait.<br> Here's your key.<br> Here's your key.<br> Now go out and christen it! Go out and come back in! Door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay.<br> -Ready? -Ready! The key broke in the lock, and I can't get in.<br> Wait.<br> Oh, my God, I can't get out! -This isn't a sign! -No, it's a very old key! -It's an old key! -Oh, my God, it's old! I love you.<br> I love you.<br> Are you hugging the door right now? No.<br> Yeah, yeah, me neither.<br> So did everything go all right with the annulment? Oh, yeah.<br> No problems.<br> It's all taken care of.<br> Ross, thank you.<br> Do you wanna go see a movie? -Yeah, why not? -Pheebs? Thanks, I've already seen one.<br> Okay, I'm gonna get my sweater.<br> You wanna hear something weird? Always.<br> I didn't get the annulment.<br> What? We're still married.<br> Don't tell Rachel.<br> See you later.<br> What are you doing? Key is stuck in the lock.<br> I can fix it.<br> Hold on.<br> Watch out, watch out.<br> It still doesn't work.<br> I'm not finished.<br> Nice job, Joe.<br> You're quite the craftsman!   <br>
