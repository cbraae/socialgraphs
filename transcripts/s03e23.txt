                    			Wouldn't it be cool if our duck and our chick had a baby? We could call it Chuck.<br> Or Dick.<br> Listen, I need a favor.<br> I was in the shower, and as I was.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>cleansing myself, I felt something.<br> Was it like a sneeze, only better? No.<br> I mean, like, a thing on my body.<br> Well, what was it? Well, I don't know.<br> It's kind of in a place that's not.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> It's not visually accessible to me.<br> And I was hoping maybe you guys.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>could help me out.<br> Come on, you guys! It's no big deal! Well, what is it? ls it a mole? No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.<br> Is it--? What, a pimple? No, it's.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>fancier than a pimple.<br> -Ross, just go see a doc-- -Guys, what's--? Well, it's definite.<br> Two more weeks of winter.<br> Yeah, right.<br> The One With Ross' Thing .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) And this is the coffeehouse.<br> This is where I play my music.<br> -Good deal.<br> -These are my friends.<br> People? This is vince.<br> vince, the people.<br> vince is a fireman.<br> Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building? Ninety-eight hot saves.<br> Highest on the force.<br> If Joey and I play with matches, we could get you up to an even 1 00.<br> Fire safety is not a joke, son.<br> You're right.<br> I know.<br> Look, I gotta go.<br> I'm on call tonight.<br> See you Saturday.<br> He's cute, Pheebs.<br> But you just started dating that teacher.<br> Oh, Jason? We're seeing each other tonight.<br> Well, Pheebs? Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.<br> I know, I know.<br> I'm, like, playing the field.<br> I'm juggling two guys.<br> I'm sowing my wild oats.<br> You know, this kind of, like, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.<br> So do they know about each other? Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no, they don't know.<br> Hey, guys.<br> -Well? -How'd it go at the doctor's? He said there's definitely nothing to worry about.<br> It's benign.<br> -What is it? -He couldn't even tell me.<br> He said it was just some sort of "skin abnormality.<br> " The worse thing is, he said, being unable to identify it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he was reluctant to remove it.<br> You should go to my guy.<br> Because when I went in there with my third nipple.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he just lopped it right off.<br> So I guess I'm lucky.<br> I mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.<br> At least they knew what yours was.<br> You know? Yours had a name.<br> Maybe they'll name yours after you.<br> You know? They'd call it "The Ross.<br> " And then people would be, like, "Oh, he's got a Ross.<br> " Yeah, that'd be cool.<br> Pete's breaking up with me.<br> What? I just checked my messages.<br> He said that when he gets back, "We need to talk.<br> " -And? -Well, that's it.<br> People never say, "We need to talk," unless it's something bad.<br> That doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.<br> Really? Maybe he just cheated on you.<br> I won't get rich doing it, but I gotta say, it's cool.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>knowing you're making a difference in a kid's life.<br> That is so great.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We'd better call the fire department.<br> Well, we don't need a fireman.<br> We need, like, a good mechanic.<br> Here they come! We gotta get out of here! Wait.<br> Why? If I wanted to see a fireman, I'd date one.<br> That's all it is.<br> A third nipple.<br> You know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.<br> You can take it off.<br> Just slice that baby right off.<br> Take your shirt off.<br> Let's see what we're dealing with.<br> What are you doing? Just showing you my run-of-the-mill, slice-it-right-off third nipple.<br> Well, that's not a third nipple.<br> First of all, it's on your ass.<br> Well, then what is it? Wait a minute.<br> Hold it.<br> -Jansen, come in here.<br> -I'm with Hamilton! He's good with weird things.<br> Bring him in too.<br> I gotta go water Pete's plants.<br> You know what? lf he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water them.<br> If he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should do it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>if you know what I mean.<br> Or.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we could go and pee on them.<br> I can't take it, you know.<br> I'm afraid one of them will catch me with the other.<br> It's making me crazy! Why don't you break up with one of them? What happened to playing the field? It doesn't feel like playing anymore.<br> It's feels like work.<br> It's like I'm working in the field.<br> So pick one of them.<br> Which one do you like more? vince is great, you know? Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.<br> He's just so burly, so very burly.<br> Okay, good.<br> So there you go.<br> Go with vince.<br> But Jason's really sensitive.<br> Sensitive is important.<br> Pick him.<br> Oh, sure.<br> Go with the sissy.<br> Jason is not a sissy.<br> I meant Chandler.<br> You know, I have dinner plans.<br> Thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.<br> Ladies and gentlemen, I've been practicing medicine for 23 years.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I'm stumped.<br> Okay, this is the den.<br> All right, check this out.<br> Lights! All right, less lights! Bad lights! Lights, go away! See? You just need the right command.<br> And the dimmer switch.<br> For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.<br> That's the video phone.<br> But you shouldn't be here.<br> So don't touch anything.<br> IKEA, this is comfortable! This place is amazing! -Oh, God! That's the nicest kitchen.<br> -I know.<br> It's the nicest kitchen.<br> The refrigerator told me to have a great day.<br> Look, a millionaire's checkbook.<br> Joey, put that down.<br> Oh, my God, that's Pete.<br> Get out! How the hell do you answer a video phone? I guess that's how.<br> Monica, how's it going? Oh, it's good.<br> It's good.<br> Just here, watering the plants.<br> Don't forget that ficus there by Rachel.<br> Chandler's on the couch! I see him.<br> You guys are the worst hiders, ever.<br> -Hi.<br> -How you doing? The other day when you said you needed to talk.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>just so I know, is it good news or bad news? It's good news.<br> It's definitely good news.<br> Hold on a second, I have another call.<br> How's it going? It's still me.<br> I've got picture-in-picture here.<br> I'm gonna have to call you back later.<br> Monica? You.<br> I'm gonna have to call you back.<br> So I'll see you soon.<br> -Okay.<br> I love you.<br> -I love you.<br> We love you too! Well, it's good news.<br> It's good news.<br> -What do you think the good news is? -Look at this! He wrote a check for $50,000 to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design.<br> " Sorry.<br> What do you think the good news is? Oh, my! Monica's gonna marry a millionaire! You gotta get Mom on the phone! Call Mom! Call Mom! And that's Pete's mom.<br> You have to make it a theme wedding.<br> And the theme could be: "Look How Much Money We've Got! " I mean, you could put money in the invitations.<br> You could have, like, little-money place settings.<br> And you could start with a money salad.<br> I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.<br> Would you stop? We've only gone out a couple of weeks.<br> We don't know if he'll propose.<br> But this is Pete.<br> He's not like other people.<br> On your first date, you went to Rome.<br> For most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.<br> Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.<br> Monica's right.<br> We're talking about marriage here.<br> She can't just rush into this.<br> What do you know? You married a lesbian! I gotta go.<br> I have to break up with vince.<br> So you're going with the teacher? I like vince a lot, you know? But Jason is so sensitive.<br> In the long run, I think sensitive is better than having.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>a really, really, really nice body.<br> Jason.<br> Definitely Jason.<br> -Wish me luck! -Good luck! Oh, my God! Sorry.<br> I was imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.<br> Excuse me.<br> Is vince here? Oh, sure.<br> I didn't know you guys actually used those.<br> So what's up? This isn't gonna be easy.<br> I don't think we should see each other anymore.<br> Good deal.<br> I'm sorry.<br> No, it's okay.<br> It's just that I thought we had something pretty special here.<br> I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to.<br> There's so much in me I haven't shared with you yet.<br> My God! I didn't know you were so-- I'm sorry.<br> I can't talk.<br> I'm gonna go write in my journal.<br> Wait! Wait! Wait! If you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.<br> Thanks.<br> But I wanna remove it, not make it savory.<br> When girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they tell their friends about it.<br> Give me that.<br> Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.<br> Bride's Magazines? I know you said you'd say no if he asked you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but how great would you look walking down the aisle.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in this Donna Karan? You so would! You should get that anyway.<br> Well, for clubbing.<br> It is so weird.<br> I know what I said.<br> But this morning.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I was lying in bed, imagining what it'd be like to say yes.<br> I know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it's not like me to do something like this.<br> But it doesn't mean I can't.<br> Right? I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.<br> And I know that we want the same things.<br> And when I thought about saying yes.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it made me really happy.<br> Oh, my God! I know.<br> I need more pie.<br> Mon, if you do get married, can I bring two guests? You didn't break up with that fireman? That was my way of telling you.<br> Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.<br> He keeps a journal and he paints.<br> He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.<br> He'd prefer watercolors, but he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.<br> So will you dump Jason? Yeah, because I have to break up with someone.<br> So Jason is sensitive.<br> But now, so is vince.<br> Plus, vince has the body.<br> You know? So.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> It's really just about the math.<br> Come on in.<br> You sounded serious on the phone.<br> Is anything wrong? You must be Ross.<br> I am Guru Saj.<br> Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never been to a guru before, so.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Well, relax.<br> If it makes you feel any better, I've attended.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>fine medical schools in Central America.<br> Well, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.<br> Come on, have a seat.<br> As I suspected, it's a kundus.<br> What's a "kundus"? I don't know.<br> What's a kundus with you? Please lie down.<br> I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.<br> I guess it's worth a try.<br> Sure.<br> We should see results-- Clearly not the way to go! What? What? We appear to have angered it.<br> We? We angered it? I think I see the problem.<br> And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.<br> Love.<br> Oh, God! There is absolutely no way this is gonna come off.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>unless you start to.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> What was that? Well, it's gone.<br> How's that? Got caught in my watch.<br> Lights.<br> Romantic lights.<br> Nice.<br> So there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.<br> Oh, right.<br> I'd completely forgot about that.<br> I've been doing a lot of thinking.<br> And I look at my life.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I feel like I've conquered the business world.<br> And I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world.<br> And now I have the most beautiful woman in the world.<br> But there's one thing missing.<br> What's that? It's time for me to conquer the physical world.<br> I wanna become.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>the Ultimate Fighting Champion.<br> You wanna what? I wanna be the Ultimate Fighting Champion.<br> It's the most intense physical competition in the world.<br> It's banned in 49 states.<br> What are you talking about? My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Jeet Kune Do and Brazilian streetfighting.<br> I even had my own octagon training ring designed.<br> And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.<br> I want you there, in the front row, when I win.<br> I want you close enough to smell the blood.<br> What do you think? My parents will be so happy.<br> Crazy underwear Creeping up my butt Crazy underwear Always in a rut Crazy underwear What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing.<br> You'll get through this.<br> You'll be fine.<br> Okay, thank you.<br> And as always, no one talk to me after the show.<br> I was passing by and saw you were playing.<br> This is cool, seeing you up there.<br> What's going on here? Who's this guy? I don't know! He just started kissing me.<br> Get him, vince! What? I've been dating both of you.<br> And it's been really horrible, because it's been.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>a lot of fun for me.<br> But I like you both.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I didn't know how to choose.<br> So I'm sorry.<br> I'm terrible.<br> I'm a terrible person.<br> Relax.<br> It's okay.<br> I mean.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> We never said this was exclusive.<br> Neither did we.<br> So give yourself a break.<br> Really? We haven't been going out that long.<br> Come on, we haven't even slept together yet.<br> You haven't? You have? Well, this is none of my business.<br> I can't believe this! You slept with him? Well, I made you a candlelight dinner in the park.<br> I'm gonna make this real easy for you.<br> That could've been really awkward.<br> You made him a candlelight dinner in the park? Yeah, but I can do that for you.<br> I'm gonna do that for you.<br> I can't believe I went out with somebody.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>who'd have an open flame in the middle of a wooded area! Everything's gonna be all right.<br> Okay, Dick? Hello.<br> I am Guru Saj.<br> He's a duck, right? Because otherwise.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>this is way out of my league.<br> He's got a really bad cough, and our vet can't stop it.<br> Is there something you can do? Let me see.<br> Let me see.<br> Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?   <br>
