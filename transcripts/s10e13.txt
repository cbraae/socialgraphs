Oh hi, thanks for showing up 30 minutes late! - Ross - No no, I'm sure you have a great excuse.<br> What, was it a hair appointment? A mani-pedi or is there a sale at Barney's? My father had a heart attack while I was at Barney's.<br> - Oh my god.<br> - Honey.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> Is he ok?

Ok, what are you gonna be doing today? Oh, I want to see everything.<br> Time Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center Oh, you know what you should do, you should walk all the way to the top of Statue of Liberty.<br> - Oh yeah, let's do that! - Great.<br> This baby better be really good.<br> Hi, excuse me.<br> I'm here to see my father.<br> My name is Rachel Green.<br> And I'm Dr Ross Galler.<br> Ross, please.<br> This is a hospital, ok? That actually means sth here.<br> - So, can we plase go in? - Absolutely.<br> Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't wanna infect him.<br> Ross, please, don't be so scared of him.<br> I am not scared of him, I'm really sick.<br> He's still under sedation, so he's pretty much out.<br> I'm feeling better.<br> Oh, my god.<br> Oh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh? Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.<br> Oh, great.<br> Uh, are you gonna be ok? He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine.<br> Did the TV wake you? No, when you put your feet up on my bed, you tucked on my cathode.<br> Ouchy.<br> What are you doing here, Galler? Well, I came with Rachel who should be back any second.<br> So what's new? Ooh, I had a little heart attack.<br> Great, is it painful? What? A heart attack is sitting here talking to you.<br> Let's see if we can get Rachel back in here.<br> So what's new with you, huh? Knocked up any more of my daughters laterly? Nope! Just the one.<br> Rach! Noo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down.<br> Ok, let's just try one syllable at a time.<br> Ok, so repeat after me.<br> Great, ok, faster.<br> Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you! What are you doing? I have to go before pull your head through a wall! No, no! Don't go, I need you.<br> My audition is tomorrow! Hey.<br> I was gonna make some dinner but all I found in your dad's frige was bacon and heavy cream.<br> I think we solve the mystery of heart attack.<br> Did you call your parents? - Oh, yeah, Emma is doing great.<br> - Oh, good.<br> Wow.<br> What? Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.<br> What do you mean? You have been in my room before.<br> Yeah, sure, right.<br> Like I have ever been in Rachel Green's room.<br> Ok, I gotta tell you, it's really weird when you use my whole name.<br> Sorry.<br> - Are you ok? - Yeah.<br> 'Yeah' to a rough day, huh? Yeah, it's just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean, he's a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick.<br> But we do.<br> You know, he's gonna be ok, Rach.<br> Oh, I don't want him to wake up alone, I should go to the hospital.<br> What? No, no, wait.<br> Hey hey, look.<br> They gave him a lot medication, ok, he wouldn't even know if you were there.<br> Look, we'll go and see him the first thing in the morning, ok? - Really? I shouldn't feel guilty? - No, God.<br> Hey.<br> Rach, you've been an amazing doughter, ok? Right now, you just need to get some rest.<br> Ok, maybe you're right.<br> Good night.<br> Wait, wait.<br> Would you stay here with me for a while? Sure.<br> Thank you for coming with me today.<br> Oh, of course.<br> Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.<br> Me, too.<br> Come here.<br> I just don't want to be alone tonight.<br> Ok, well, I can, maybe grab a sleeping bag or No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this is a good idea.<br> We won't know that until we do it, will we? No, uh look, uhm You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable.<br> And I just don't feel it will be right if I'd like be, you know, taking advantage of you.<br> What taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy! Ok, I'm sure it would be great but I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so I'm gonna go.<br> I'll see you in the morning.<br> Haven't had sex in 4 months, I should get a medal for that! Thanks so much for taking me to all these places, I had a great time.<br> Oh, I'm glad.<br> Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though.<br> I just did not see this coming.<br> NY is awesome! What is with you? You know, I've been to these before but I've never really seen them, you know? Yeah, you missed a lot when you were mooing.<br> Thanks so much for showing me around.<br> Oh, it was our pleasure.<br> We're so much enjoying getting to know you.<br> Well, is there anything else you want to know? Oh, uh, ok.<br> Do you mind if I ask you some questions about the father? Oh, sure, yeah.<br> Well, he was my high school boyfriend, captain of the football team, really cute.<br> And he got a scholarship, went off to college.<br> That's great.<br> Yeah, it's almost definitely him.<br> How is that now? Well, there is a chance it's another guy.<br> I mean, I've only ever been with 2 guys but they sorta overlapped.<br> So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to the college, too? No, he's in prison.<br> Uh, was he falsely accused of sth? No.<br> He killed his father with a shovel.<br> But other than that he's a great guy.<br> I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.<br> - Are you awake? - Of course I'm awake.<br> As so from now on I'm always awake.<br> Alright, we don't know that it's him.<br> I mean, it could be the football guy.<br> Honey, it's us.<br> Of course it's the shovel killer.<br> Alright, alright, let's say it is him.<br> Would we not want baby? No.<br> Would we treat him any differently? I'll keep an eye on him.<br> - We have to find out which one the father is.<br> - How? I don't know, there're tests for these things, right? Yeah, but maybe we're just overreacting.<br> Easy for you to say.<br> He's a father killer.<br> He probably loves his mommy.<br> He's probably got a tattoo says "Mom" on the shovel wielding arm.<br> "We'll now count from 1 to 5: .<br>.<br>" - "Good job!" - Thank you.<br> Hey, Joey.<br> Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought it about a lot know I was too inpatient.<br> So let's try it again.<br> Oh no, that's ok.<br> I don't need your help.<br> I work it out on myself and I gotta say I'm pretty good.<br> Really? Can I hear some of them? Sure, sure.<br> Ok.<br> See? Alright, you're not, you're not Again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH! Oh, well I think I am, yeah.<br> And I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.<br> How could you possibly think that? For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job! Hi, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee? Sure.<br> You've been quiet all morning, is everything ok? - You sure you are alright.<br> - Yep.<br> Ookay.<br> Uhm, well I'm gonna go grab some breakfast.<br> - FYI - There it is.<br> In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.<br> Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.<br> Really? Well it seems to me if you've done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.<br> - Well - Oh, stop that! I can't believe this.<br> What do you I was just being a good guy.<br> I treated you with respect and understanding.<br> Ahh, that is so hot.<br> Hey, I was looking out for you.<br> Oh, really? Well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl, I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.<br> I gotta say I have not had sex a lot times before, this is the worst ever.<br> Oh really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me, either.<br> Oh, ok, you know, hey hey! You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say you and me, never having sex again.<br> What? That's right, sex is off the table! I'm never having sex with you again.<br> Dr Green, are you feeling better? Hey, how was lunch? We had a good time.<br> BTW, I want to ask you sth.<br> It would really mean a lot to me.<br> If the baby is a boy, would you name him after my father Jiminy Billy Bob? Oh, really? Noo.<br> You were right, that was fun.<br> I'm gonna go finish packing.<br> So, is she gonna take the test? No, she doesn't have to.<br> I found out who the father is.<br> Oh, God, it's Shovelly Joe, isn't it? No, it's not.<br> How do you know? Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class.<br> Because the thing she did with the prison guy would be pretty hard to make a baby that way.<br> Oh, God.<br> What was it? The thing we hardly ever do or the thing we never do? The thing we never do.<br> Shovelly Joe.<br> - Whenever you're ready, Joey.<br> - Right.<br> I'm sorry, what's going on? Dude, come on.<br> French it up.<br> Joey, do you speak French? You know what, I think this audition is over.<br> Uh, excuse me? Uh, I am Ugeon Phillogne.<br> I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estelloude.<br> You really think this man is speaking French.<br> Good job, little buddy.<br> That was some really good French.<br> But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.<br> Oh, alright.<br> But my French was good? It was great.<br> Merci.<br> - Emmas's down for the night.<br> - Oh, good.<br> So, I guess I'm gonna takeoff.<br> Hey, listen, just before you go, I Again I just wanna say 'thank you' for coming with me.<br> Oh, no problem.<br> And also, you know I I was thinking about what you said, uh, you know, about the whole sex thing and Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm glad you agree.<br> It's shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.<br> Yeah, yeah, that's true.<br> Hey, do you remember that one really great time? Oh, yeah.<br> - You know, it was your birthday - It was Valentine's day - Oh, yeah.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> Well, I guess that's all the past now.<br> Uh-huh.<br> - Not even one more time.<br> - Not even once.<br> - No matter how much we want it.<br> - Even if we want it REALLY bad.<br> That's what WE decided.<br> Right.<br> - It's kinda hard, though.<br> - Yeah.<br> You know? When two people have a connection, you know, that's just seems like such a waste.<br> I hate waste.<br> - Ross - Yes.<br> Just so you know, with us, it's never off the table.<br> Dammit, it's never off the table.<br> Ok, can you really tap dance? No.<br> Off the resume.<br> - Archery? - No.<br> - Horseback riding? - Would fall off a lot.<br> You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds? That I can do.<br> Come on, you can drink a GALLON of milk in 10 seconds? Alright, watch me! Ok, your time, are you ready? Ready, go! You did it!   <br>
