                    			Can you help me pick an engagement ring? I don't know.<br> Should I get her a Tiffany cut, or a princess cut or a-- Paper cut?! -Have you told anyone else? -No, I don't want Monica to find out.<br> You told me.<br> Because I trust you, and we're friends.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you saw me looking at ring brochures.<br> Once again, not knocking pays off.<br> -I wish you hadn't been on the toilet.<br> -Me too.<br> -Want to go to the coffeehouse? -Oh, all right.<br> We were just gonna see if you wanted to go.<br> Well, we don't, because we got the other place.<br> How rude.<br> Sorry.<br> Want a bite? The One With The Ring Gelula/SDI So how are things going with Paul? Good.<br> Although, you know, he's a private guy.<br> I wish I could get him to open up.<br> Share some feelings.<br> You just have to think of him as a jar of pickles that won't open.<br> I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table? That's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.<br> -Watch this.<br> -Okay.<br> -Hey, Paul.<br> -Hi, Phoebe.<br> How are things going with you? Can't complain.<br> -Hey! -Hi.<br> -Great to-- -Ross, good to see you too.<br> You take care.<br> What was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before? That was so weird, huh? Why did you do it? I didn't do it.<br> It was Chandler.<br> He's mad at you.<br> -What? Why? -Oh, please.<br> I think you know why.<br> I can't think of anything.<br> Come on.<br> You're a paleontologist.<br> Dig a little deeper.<br> Is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game? Is that something he'd be mad at you for? -I guess it could.<br> -Well, then I think that's it.<br> If he's angry, he shouldn't hide it.<br> I wish he'd just tell me the truth.<br> You should run him under hot water and bang his head against the table.<br> Honey, I made a reservation at China Garden.<br> Yeah, that's great.<br> But first, talk to me.<br> Talk to me.<br> Tell me about your day.<br> It was fine.<br> Okay.<br> What are you thinking right now? That you are looking really fine in that dress.<br> Yeah, that's great, Paul.<br> But, you know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I want to know what-- Wow, those are really great! I just want to know.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>what is behind this strong, silent exterior? They say that still waters run deep, and I want to swim in yours.<br> Are you talking about having sex? No, Paul.<br> I don't know anything about you.<br> Tell me about your childhood.<br> Normal.<br> Then how about puberty? Come on! That's always a painful time.<br> Your pals have a slumber party and stick your hand in warm water.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>while you sleep so you pee in your sleeping bag.<br> No, that never happened to me.<br> Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.<br> Anyway.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> The rest of your life.<br> Any regrets? No.<br> I'm not asking for a lot here.<br> Just give me something.<br> Anything.<br> -Okay.<br> -Okay.<br> When I was 6 years old, I wanted a Big Wheel.<br> And instead, my parents got me this little.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>plastic chicken that you hop around on.<br> It was embarrassing.<br> Kids made fun of me.<br> That was a pretty tough year.<br> That's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better.<br> Okay, come on.<br> Now we can go eat.<br> Let's go! It was horrible.<br> They called me "Chicken Boy.<br> " In fifth grade, I got in a fight.<br> Well, not really.<br> Richard Danville bit me on the nose.<br> I still have a little scar right here.<br> You can see it.<br> Yeah, yeah.<br> I see the scar.<br> I think this is really great that, you know, you've shared your feelings.<br> It's really.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> It's beautiful.<br> But what do you say we go share some food? No, I couldn't eat now.<br> What are you talking about? You love their Kung Pao chicken! Chicken? -Chicken Boy! -I'm sorry.<br> I didn't mean to do that.<br> This is the nine millionth ring store, and I can't find the perfect ring.<br> Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> It's a beautiful selection.<br> So maybe you don't get her a ring.<br> Maybe you do something different.<br> An engagement bracelet.<br> Or an engagement tiara! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.<br> Imagine getting down on one knee.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry? I'm gonna stick with the ring.<br> This one's nice.<br> I like it.<br> Sir? Kind sir, can I see this one? This is the reason you brought me.<br> I know how to haggle.<br> Let me handle this from here.<br> Can I help you? -I would like to see that ring, please.<br> -Or not.<br> Whatever.<br> This ring is from the 1 920s.<br> It's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires.<br> Sir, could I ask you to.<br> .<br> .<br>? Could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you? -Okay.<br> -Okay.<br> Will you marry me? Oh, my God, that's it! That's the ring! -How much is it? -I will handle this.<br> How much is it? $8600.<br> We will give you $1 0.<br> -Are you interested in this ring? -Yes.<br> But I can only pay $8000.<br> -Okay.<br> I can let it go for 8.<br> -We stand firm at $1 0.<br> -How'd you like to pay? -Credit card.<br> Oh, no! I lent my credit card to Joey.<br> I'll go get it.<br> You guard the ring.<br> Listen, I'm sorry about before.<br> Do you have anything here for $1 0? Yes.<br> I have these two rather beautiful.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>five-dollar bills.<br> I'll give you $1 for them.<br> Remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday? No.<br> -Remember, you were eating pizza? -Yeah.<br> Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game.<br> We were supposed to just get him one? That guy's always mooching off of us.<br> Anyway, I still think we should try to patch things up.<br> We could get him tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.<br> That's a great idea.<br> And I still have his credit card.<br> Here you go.<br> Hey, hey.<br> I got this one.<br> Here you go.<br> Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.<br> We do stuff all the time without you, and you don't get all upset.<br> -All the time? -All the time.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God! -Still crying? -Like a little girl.<br> I know, I know.<br> This is all my fault.<br> I wanted him to open up.<br> I didn't know that I was gonna unleash.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>this weepy, clingy, moist monster! I only know of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up.<br> One of them is sex.<br> -What's the other? -Don't know.<br> Never had to use it.<br> I'm just saying, if we're having sex, he's not talking.<br> That's right.<br> You're the talker.<br> Anyway, great idea.<br> I gotta buy him some more tissues.<br> -We have some here.<br> -No, you don't! Okay.<br> I'd also like to try on the tiara.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> Okay.<br> What do you think? Too much? A tad.<br> Take the tiara back.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and let me hold the musket again.<br> Something's missing.<br> Let me see the ring that my friend picked out.<br> Where's the 1 920s princess-cut ring? I just sold it to that gentleman.<br> Oh, my God! Wait, no! Let me out! Now! Rachel? No.<br> -How are you, Paul? -Okay.<br> Chandler.<br> .<br> .<br> -.<br> .<br> .<br>did your dad ever hug you? -No.<br> Did he hug you? No! No.<br> It's just that my dad never did.<br> I miss my dad.<br> You can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.<br> -Hey, Chandler? -Yeah? Would you.<br> .<br> .<br>? Would you hug me? -I'm a little busy here, Paul.<br> -That's what my dad used to say.<br> Okay.<br> A quick one.<br> Come on, hug it out.<br> There you go.<br> Okay.<br> -Five more seconds-- -Okay! -Joey! -What? Hey, what--? Hi.<br> Paul, is it? -Do you have my credit card? -Yeah.<br> It's in my.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> In my pocket.<br> -My back pocket! -Thank God.<br> -I got tickets to the Knicks tonight.<br> -I can't go.<br> It'll be fun.<br> Me, you, Ross and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Paul, probably.<br> Chandler, I found the perfect ring.<br> I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.<br> Oh, wake up, Chandler.<br> The one you picked is gone.<br> It's over! What? Some guy bought it.<br> I tried to stop him but they put me in jail! -They put you in jail? -The little jail between the doors! -I asked you to guard the ring! -I know! I'm sorry.<br> But this ring is better.<br> And Monica never even saw the other ring.<br> Yeah.<br> But when he proposed to me with the ring, I got goosebumps.<br> -Maybe it was the guy.<br> -It was the ring! -Was he excited about the tickets? -No! He blew us off! -What? -I know.<br> I can't believe it.<br> Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now! Can I tell you something? Me too! He didn't want to talk to us about being angry? Maybe we don't talk to him at all! -Freeze him out.<br> -Right! -I like it.<br> -We'll show him.<br> From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.<br> We'll be the new Joey and Chandler.<br> Hi, I'm back.<br> I've written down more to tell you! Oh, that's great.<br> No, actually, that's.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> That's great.<br> That's really great.<br> You know, I gotta tell you, writing, all that writing, it gets me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> It gets me kind of hot.<br> Wait, wait.<br> Listen to this: Know what I wanted to be at that age? A lover? -A surfer.<br> -A surfer? -I wanted to be one with the waves-- -Hold on.<br> Let me just get a little more comfortable here.<br> Wait a second.<br> -This isn't too revealing, is it? -No.<br> Whatever happened to that little dude? So full of dreams.<br> I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to any more of this! The only one who'd listen is a mental health professional! That's only because they get $1 00 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2000! Know when I figured that out? While you were talking! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me, when 1 4 hours ago.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we figured out that that's what my mother was trying to do to me! I'm sorry.<br> I don't mean.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I didn't mean to stifle you.<br> This is all just a little overwhelming.<br> I'm so sorry.<br> I didn't mean to overwhelm you.<br> It's just that when those gates open.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>it's hard to close them.<br> But they are closed now.<br> Believe me.<br> I'm so glad.<br> I'm so glad you shared.<br> And I'm glad that you're done.<br> So what do you say we.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I'd really like that.<br> That was so good! Oh, oh.<br> I can't believe you talked me into this gumball-machine-looking ring.<br> It's not gumball machine-looking.<br> It's a beautiful ring! No, it's not.<br> When I looked at the other ring, I could see Monica's face.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and see her saying yes.<br> When I look at this, all I see is a ring.<br> Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye.<br> This is the most important thing I'll ever do.<br> I want to make it perfect.<br> Maybe we could get the other ring back.<br> I heard where the guy was gonna propose.<br> Maybe we could get him to trade rings.<br> I can't do that.<br> You certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.<br> There he is.<br> He hasn't proposed yet.<br> She has no ring on her finger.<br> Wow, you're good! After this, we should solve crimes.<br> Okay.<br> Go get him.<br> Oh, okay.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Could you come with me? You have a phone call.<br> -Who is it? -It is your office.<br> -Do you know who at my office? -John.<br> Oh, John! Great! -There he is.<br> -Hi.<br> Okay.<br> There was a mix-up at the store.<br> The ring you have was supposed to be held for me.<br> I'm gonna need to have that back.<br> In exchange, I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.<br> Wow, I would trade.<br> It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one.<br> Excuse me.<br> This is my fiancÃ©e, and her heart was set on that ring.<br> Do you want to break her heart? Yeah.<br> Do you want to break a dying woman's heart? You're dying? Yeah, she's dying.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>of a cough, apparently.<br> It's my dying wish to have that ring.<br> If I'm not buried with it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>my spirit will wander the netherworld-- That's enough, honey! Oh, I don't know.<br> -Let me see it.<br> -Great.<br> Okay, here.<br> -All right, I'll do it.<br> -Thank you.<br> And you are about to marry a wonderful man.<br> Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman! Guys? I got something important to tell you.<br> Guys.<br> Guys? Guys? I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.<br> I think we gotta end the freeze-out.<br> Wait.<br> Is this for real? Yeah.<br> Check out the ring.<br> Oh, my God! So you two are really serious? Yeah, pretty much.<br> You're gonna get married? We're gonna be brothers-in-law! Come here! And we're gonna be friends again.<br> What? -Water under the bridge! Forget it! -Okay.<br> I was gonna wait till it was official, but I had to tell you guys.<br> You're my best friends.<br> I think I'm gonna cry.<br> Oh! No more crying! I just dumped one crybaby.<br> I'll dump you too.<br> I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.<br> Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, Chandler! You guys are gonna be so happy! -I know.<br> -Where's all the tissues?! Check out the ring.<br> Oh, nice.<br> One and a half carat, easy.<br> -Hey.<br> -Hey, Pheebs.<br> -He's gonna ask Monica to marry him.<br> -I helped pick out the ring.<br> You told her before you told us? She walked in while I was looking at brochures.<br> You can understand that.<br> Guys? Guys?   <br>
