We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.<br> Okay? Whose official name is Bapstein-King.<br> Okay! Okay! There it is.<br> Oh, look at that! Isn't Mother Nature amazing? That's a plane.<br> Well, all right, 1 700 bags of peanuts flying that high that's pretty amazing too.<br> - I wonder if you can see my apartment.<br> - No, you can't.<br> - What? - I don't know.<br> Man, look at all those stars.<br> Infinite space.<br> It really makes you wonder, doesn't it? - Know what else makes you wonder? - What? Check out the rack on that chick.<br> The One Where They're Up All Night We've been out here for two hours and we haven't seen any stupid comets.<br> Can we go now? I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.<br> No, I'm not.<br> Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket? Because it's flattering! Come on, Monica.<br> Come on, Monica.<br> - We're going too.<br> We got a movie.<br> - I won't say no to a movie.<br> Oh, Pheebs, we just actually wanted to be alone.<br> - Sh.<br> Get me out of here.<br> - Oh, okay.<br> - Hey, Ross.<br> - What? - Check it out.<br> - Is it the comet? No.<br> Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.<br> I can't believe I bring you to see the Bapstein-King comet one of nature's most spectacular phenomena and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and some woman.<br> You know, there's two women, dude.<br> Show me where.<br> Okay.<br> Right up here.<br> Joey, where's the pipe that was holding the door open? I don't know.<br> Yeah, I do.<br> - Joey! - What? Hey, don't look at me! You wanted to come up here and look for some stupid Burger King comet.<br> It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay? Hey, Bapstein was a very well-respected astronomer from No! - Monica.<br> - She's sleeping.<br> I know.<br> Just a quick question.<br> Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon? Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duvall.<br> Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.<br> Sorry, I just can't sleep.<br> Where's that book you're reading with two women who are ice-skating and wearing those hats with the flowers on it.<br> Because every time I look at that cover, I'm like It's in the living room, where there's also a light and no one will kick you in the shin.<br> What? Please don't be a spaceship.<br> Please don't be a spaceship.<br> Oh, thank God.<br> How could you be beeping? I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can? Don't interrupt me! Monica! Monica! Come on! I can't believe this! All right, well, I guess we know what we have to do to get down.<br> Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.<br> Help us! Please, help us! We're stuck up on the roof, and we can't get down! Ross.<br> I was thinking we'd just go down the fire escape.<br> I know.<br> I wasn't finished.<br> But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape! Sh! I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.<br> With a wok? My boring book didn't put you to sleep? It got interesting.<br> Damn you, Oprah! Here, let me make the milk.<br> I'm up anyway.<br> You know what we could do now that we're up? We could just talk to each other all night long.<br> Like when we were first dating.<br> It'd be fun.<br> - Okay, that does sound fun.<br> - Yeah.<br> So how bummed were you when the second sister died, huh? The second sister dies?! No.<br> No, I was talking about the book I was reading.<br> The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest? That's correct.<br> Want to go in the bedroom? It's more comfortable.<br> - Sure.<br> - Okay.<br> Oh, wait, did you send those contracts to Milan? If this is your idea of sexy talk .<br> Did you overnight the contracts I gave you? What contracts? Please tell me this is just one of your jokes that I don't get.<br> Like what? Like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag, I'm serious.<br> This isn't funny.<br> Those contracts had to go out today.<br> You didn't give me any contracts.<br> Yes, I did.<br> I put a little Post-it on it that said: "Must go out today," and I underlined "today" three times.<br> Then I put a little heart in the corner so I wouldn't seem too bossy.<br> You never gave them to me.<br> If we went to the office, you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.<br> No, I'd see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk.<br> Maybe I'm embarrassed because you talk on the phone with your crotch.<br> You want to go to the office now? Come on, it's late.<br> We're not going down to the office.<br> Yeah, I understand.<br> I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.<br> All right, get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work! It won't go down any further.<br> It's stuck.<br> We'll just have to jump.<br> Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side.<br> And try to avoid that weird brownish-red stuff in the middle.<br> So when you get down there you go up to the roof and you let me in.<br> - Wait a minute.<br> I have to do it? - You'll be fine.<br> It'll be just like bungee jumping, you know? But instead of bouncing back up, you won't.<br> Well, what if I smack my head on the concrete? Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey.<br> It's a possibility.<br> I don't know.<br> Tell you what, let's flip to see who does it.<br> - You call it in the air, all right? - Oh, all right.<br> - Can you see what it is? - No.<br> - Okay.<br> Well, you be careful.<br> - No, Ross, stop it.<br> I'm not jumping.<br> Look, I have an audition tomorrow, and I can't go if I break my leg.<br> Well, I'm not jumping.<br> I have a son.<br> He won't have a father if I die.<br> So it looks like we're even.<br> Okay, so this wire is connected to this wire, which plugs into here.<br> Okay, so to get the beeping to stop, all I have to do .<br> Okay.<br> Well done, Pheebs.<br> What do you want from me?! Here's your milk.<br> What should we talk about? What? What? What? Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie? I'm sorry.<br> Here.<br> Okay.<br> Feel free to look but I'm telling you those contracts are not here.<br> How could you know? Look at this mess, Tag.<br> This is what I'm saying.<br> You have to be more organized.<br> You've got newspapers, you've got magazines, you Oh! And who's this chippy? A little young for you, but whatever.<br> That's my sister.<br> Really? Very cute braces.<br> Anyway, you know what? The point is, Tag, start looking because you're gonna find those contracts on your desk.<br> So when do you imagine you gave them to me? Morning or afternoon? In the afternoon.<br> Mr.<br> Zelner came into my office after lunch he put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-it on it that said: "Must go out today.<br> " So you just keep looking in there, all right? They're not here.<br> Puzzler.<br> Bit of a puzzle.<br> Why don't you check the copy room? Maybe the contracts are in there.<br> - How could I have left them there? - I don't know.<br> How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world.<br> Just go, please? - Fine.<br> - Thank you.<br> Hello? I still don't get it.<br> You still awake? Yeah.<br> You? You do know that was me that just said that, right? Hey.<br> As long as we're both up .<br> Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.<br> Man, I'm starving.<br> What the hell was I thinking at dinner? "Do you want soup or salad?" Both, always order both.<br> You know, I'm looking, and I don't think anyone's home here.<br> I say we just break the window crawl through and you know, explain later.<br> - No one's home? - I don't think so.<br> Hello? So when you get in there .<br> Okay.<br> This is where you and I part ways.<br> Noisy bitch! Oh, what? What are you doing? Do you know what just happened? Yeah.<br> We had sex and then we fell asleep.<br> No.<br> We were in the middle of sex and you fell asleep.<br> No.<br> No, that's not true.<br> No, best time ever.<br> Yeah.<br> You rock my world.<br> - Monica? - What? I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it.<br> So please wake up so we can do it right.<br> Okay.<br> Okay.<br> I'm ready.<br> - Come on, big fella.<br> - Okay.<br> - Give me the good stuff.<br> - Yeah.<br> No, no, no.<br> Don't fall asleep.<br> Okay, I'm going to make you some coffee.<br> Well, I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.<br> Okay, I'm up.<br> I'm up.<br> Hi.<br> I got you some coffee to So you got anything for me? - Still no luck.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> You checked your entire desk and all the drawers? - Want me to check again? - I wish you would.<br> Well, no, it's not in there.<br> How about that drawer? Well, it's not out here.<br> Any chance it could be in your office? I don't know.<br> I mean, let me check.<br> Any luck? See you in my office for a minute? You found them! I'm not even gonna gloat.<br> - I'm just really relieved it's - You put these on my desk.<br> - I did not.<br> - Oh, really?

How did you get back here? Phoebe Buffay? Fire Alarm? Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.<br> Can I help you? Your fire alarm was in the trash.<br> - That's not mine.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> How do you know? If you dump a fire alarm, don't use a blanket that says: "Property of Phoebe Buffay, not Monica.<br> " Do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked, this was still America.<br> Please reattach it.<br> It's illegal to disconnect them.<br> Fine.<br> But please, God, tell me how to stop it from going off? Press the reset button.<br> There's a reset button? Oh, thank you.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh.<br> There's a reset button? My God! Why didn't I see that?

Maybe we should talk about that for a little while! - It still looks pretty far.<br> - It's not that far.<br> Just drop.<br> Do not rush me!
