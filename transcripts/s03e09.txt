                    			Oh, come on! It's your Thanksgiving too.<br> Instead of watching football, you could help.<br> We know.<br> You wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.<br> No, you want to put them in concentric circles.<br> I want to do this.<br> Every year.<br> The One With the Football .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) To the 10, to the 5.<br> Touchdown, Giants! You know, for once, I am gonna try to watch one of these things.<br> Halftime.<br> Who wants to throw the ball around? Get a little 3-on-3 going? -That would be fun! -Can I play too? I've never played football, ever.<br> Great! You can cover Chandler.<br> I don't really want to play.<br> You never do anything since you and Janice broke up.<br> Not true.<br> I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.<br> And start drinking in the morning.<br> Don't say I don't have goals! You have to start getting over her, all right? If you play, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.<br> If you don't, everyone will be mad at you because the teams won't be even.<br> All right, I'll play.<br> Let's do it! Ross? -What? -Wanna play football? Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.<br> Says who? Your mom? Every Thanksgiving, we used to have a touch football game.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>called The Geller Bowl.<br> No, no, no.<br> You say that proudly! Anyway, Ross and I were always captains.<br> It got kind of competitive, and one year, Geller Bowl vl.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I accidentally broke Ross' nose.<br> It was so not an accident.<br> She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>her big fat grandma-arm elbow in my face.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and just kept running.<br> To score the winning touchdown, by the way.<br> You did not win the game.<br> The touchdown didn't count.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because of the spectacularly illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.<br> I won the game.<br> Yeah? Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup? There was a Geller Cup? Yes, the trophy you got if you won the game.<br> But Dad said nobody won, and he was sick of our fighting.<br> So he took the trophy.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>threw it in the lake.<br> And was the curse lifted? Anyway.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>Mom said we weren't allowed to play football again.<br> You know what? I think we should play a game.<br> I mean, come on.<br> It's been 1 2 years.<br> Can I see you for a second? Wuss! All right, we're gonna play.<br> Wait.<br> How we gonna get there? My mom won't let me cross the street.<br> Here you go.<br> -Let's bring it in.<br> -Wait.<br> Honey, throw it to me! Here you go.<br> That almost hit me in the face! We have to pick captains.<br> And then "Tenilles.<br> " So how do we decide that? -Why don't we just bunny up? -What? -Bunny! -Bunny! Looks like Ross and I are captains.<br> I bunnied first, so I get to pick first.<br> Joey.<br> -Thank you.<br> -Monica! I'm your best friend.<br> Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.<br> Sweetie, now I pick you.<br> You don't pick me.<br> You're stuck with me! Okay.<br> So let's see.<br> Let's play from the trash can to the light post, right? Two-hand touch.<br> We'll kick off.<br> People, listen.<br> I've got 28 minutes.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>before I have to baste again.<br> Wow, just like in the pros.<br> Okay, huddle up! -Huddle up over here! -Wait for me! Wait for me! Oh, cool! My first huddle.<br> So what do you guys really think of Chandler? You know what you're doing, right? Joey will catch it.<br> We'll block.<br> What's "block"? -I thought you knew what you were doing.<br> -I thought you meant in life! Break! The ball is Janice.<br> The ball is Janice.<br> Son of a--! -Come on! -I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You know what? We're just gonna throw it.<br> I got it! Go, go, go! Score! Seven to nothing! Honey, you okay? Come on, let's go.<br> Losers walk.<br> Yeah? Losers talk.<br> Actually, losers rhyme.<br> Forty-three.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>seventy-four.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> You wanna go shotgun? -One Mississippi, two Mississippi.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> -Over here! Over here! I almost caught it! Great.<br> Now the score's seven to almost seven.<br> On this play, I want you to do a down-and-out to the right, okay? -Break! -Wait.<br> What am I gonna do? You? You go long.<br> How long? Until we start to look very small.<br> Break! One Mississippi-- Switch! Switch! Switch! Thanks for stopping our ball.<br> You are playing American football? Wow! You're, like, from a whole other country! I'm Dutch.<br> Hi, I'm Joey.<br> I am Margha.<br> Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.<br> You wanna play football or-- Hi, I'm Chandler.<br> Hello, Chandler.<br> Her name is Dutch and also "Margham.<br> " Come on, guys! Let's go! Second down! -Hello? It's third down.<br> -No, it's not.<br> It's second.<br> Wow.<br> "Wow" what? How it just amazes me that you're still pulling stuff like this.<br> -Pulling what? It's second down.<br> -Okay, it's second down.<br> Take all the second downs you need.<br> -I heard that.<br> -Well, I said it loud.<br> It is okay if I stay and watch? -Just sit right there.<br> -Yeah, why don't you stick around? -That went well.<br> -I think so.<br> I was thinking about asking her for her number.<br> Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself.<br> I was thinking about for me, as part of that getting-over-Janice thing.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> That.<br> If it means that much, I'll let you have her.<br> Thanks.<br> "Let me have her"? You mean if you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot? I don't like to say it out loud.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but yeah! We all have our strengths.<br> You're better with numbers and stuff.<br> Math? You're giving me math? All right, you know what? Forget about it.<br> You go for the girl.<br> We'll see who gets her.<br> I want you to run a post-pattern to the left.<br> And, sweetie-- Yeah, I know.<br> Go long.<br> All I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.<br> Well, you wanna just stay out there? Can I see that for a second? Okay, let's go.<br> -I got Joey! -Hike! One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi.<br> Fumble! What's the matter with you? This is my favorite jersey.<br> Well, now you have two.<br> Hey, I am good at math! That's it.<br> I was still gonna let you have her.<br> But now, prepare to feel bad about yourself.<br> I've been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you that's mean! Come on, guys.<br> Let's go.<br> Tie score.<br> We're running out of time.<br> Forty-two, 38, hike! I got it! Broken boobs! -Pheebs, run! -Run, Phoebe, run! Touchdown! Touchdown! The buzzer buzzed.<br> It doesn't count.<br> -After the snap.<br> -Before the snap.<br> -After.<br> -Before.<br> -Does it really matter? -Yes! But I made a touchdown.<br> It was my first touchdown.<br> Pheebs, that's great.<br> Doesn't count.<br> -Does so count.<br> -Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.<br> Oh, my God! That's fine.<br> Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.<br> Dead leg! Okay, fine.<br> You want to win by cheating, go ahead.<br> The touchdown does count.<br> You win.<br> I won't do this again.<br> I wanna beat you when you can't blame it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>on the broken nose or the buzzer or the fact that you might have mono.<br> Let's just call this tie score and it's halftime.<br> First, I don't play with cheaters.<br> Second of all, you know I had swollen glands! You know what? I think you'll play.<br> Oh, really? Why's that? Because the winner gets this.<br> The Geller Cup! Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four? Okay, good.<br> Where the hell did you get that? When you went to the hospital for your nose.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I swam into the lake and fished it out.<br> That cup is mine! No, it's not.<br> You want it, you're gonna have to win it.<br> So are we not having dinner at all? Come on, let's go.<br> It's time to get serious.<br> Huddle up.<br> Keep your head in the game.<br> It's hard, you know? His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.<br> If I take Chandler out of the running, will you be able to focus? -What are you gonna do? -Just make sure he catches the ball.<br> I'll do the rest.<br> -Come on, you wuss! -Okay, come on.<br> I got it! Come on! This way! Come on! Look out! Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't see that every day.<br> What's with the tackling? What? I just touched him and he went over.<br> Okay.<br> You wanna play rough? We can play rough.<br> Let's get ready to rumble! -Go, go, go! -Get her! Get her! I love this game! Where'd you get that? I went really long.<br> Forty-two to 21 .<br> Like the turkey, Ross is done! You got to pick first, so you got the better team.<br> Pathetic! Why can't you just accept that we're winning.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because I'm better than you? Oh, what a great argument.<br> Exhaling! All right, I'll prove it to you.<br> I'll trade you Joey for Rachel and I'll still win the game.<br> What? The guys against the girls? That's ridiculous because I'm only down by three touchdowns.<br> Then bring it on! Unless you're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.<br> Fine.<br> Rachel, you're with Monica.<br> Joey, you're with me.<br> I can't believe you're trading me.<br> Let's see what it's like to be on a winning team for a change.<br> You're gonna let me play? All right, then! The game is over? We eat now? The game's not over.<br> We're switching teams.<br> Chandler finds me so intimidating that it's better if we're on the same team.<br> Okay, let's play.<br> Let's go.<br> Hold on a second.<br> Where do Dutch people come from? Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch come from Pennsylvania.<br> And the other Dutch people? They come from somewhere near the Netherlands, right? Nice try.<br> The Netherlands is this make-believe place.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell live.<br> Oh, my.<br> Enough "geography for the insane.<br> " Let's play ball.<br> I'm not playing with this guy.<br> -Fine with me.<br> -I've had enough of this.<br> Let's just cut to the chase.<br> Heidi, which of my boys do you like? What are you doing? What are you doing? Which do I like? Yeah, for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill? Well, if I had to choose right now.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>which, by the way, I find really weird.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I would have to say Chandler.<br> Wait a minute.<br> She didn't understand the question.<br> Why don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her? I'm sorry.<br> That is my truth.<br> You hear that? That is her truth, Mr.<br> "I'll Let You Have Her" ! I win! You suck! I rule all! Mini-wave in celebration of me! I am now thinking I would like to change my answer to "no one.<br> " What? I now find you shallow.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and a dork.<br> Bye-bye.<br> Nice going.<br> You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.<br> It doesn't matter, because she picked me.<br> From now on, I get the dates.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and you stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook! Save the breakthroughs for therapy.<br> The clock is ticking.<br> We have no time and we are losing to girls.<br> We're not gonna lose to girls.<br> It's 42-21 ! This sucks! I was just up by that much! Are we playing football or what? Come on, you hairy-backed Marys! We have to do this.<br> We're playing for women everywhere.<br> Think about every lousy date you ever had.<br> Every guy who kept one eye on the Tv while you were making out.<br> Oh, my God.<br> You dated someone with a glass eye too? Come on, okay? This is for all womankind.<br> Let's kill them! Yeah! Kill them! All right, I want to kill them too.<br> But they're boys.<br> You know, how are we gonna beat three boys? A minute and a half left and we're down by two points.<br> Two points, ladies.<br> Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.<br> Rachel, you go long.<br> No, don't make me go long.<br> Use me.<br> They never cover me.<br> Honey, there's a reason.<br> I'm not lame, okay? I can do something.<br> Would you let me throw? This is my game too.<br> Let her throw the ball.<br> Sweep behind, I'll pitch it.<br> You throw it downfield to Phoebe.<br> Thank you.<br> -Break! -Break! All right, here we go.<br> Thirty-two, 71 , hike! One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi! Go, go, go! Catch it! -I'm so sorry.<br> Are you okay? -No, I'm not okay! They were coming at me and I didn't know what to do.<br> Thirty seconds left on the timer.<br> So we get to take that stupid troll thing home.<br> Come on! Hurry! We're running out of time.<br> Huddle up! This is our last huddle! All right, Phoebe, get open.<br> Rachel.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>go long.<br> Okay.<br> Break! I did it! Touchdown! We did it! You know? Funny thing, actually.<br> The end zone starts at that pole.<br> So you're five feet short.<br> So.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>we win! Yes, yes, yes! Wait, explain something, though.<br> If nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going? -Let me in, let me in! -No way! Let go! Let go?! I'm a tiny little woman! Come on, it's Thanksgiving! It's not important who wins or loses.<br> The important thing is the Dutch girl picked me! Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night! We should play football more often.<br> Maybe there's a league we could join.<br> Isn't there a "national football league"? Yes, there is.<br> They play on Sundays and Monday nights.<br> Oh, shoot! I work Monday nights.<br> This stuffing is amazing.<br> Do you think we should bring them some? When they're hungry, they'll come in.<br> -Let go! -No, you let go! How come it's always us left holding the ball? I don't know.<br> I guess the other people just don't care enough.<br> Hey, it's starting to snow.<br> -Give it to me! Let go! -Let it go! Come on, let go!   <br>
