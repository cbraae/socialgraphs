Thanks for going along with this.<br> - We have to pretend that we're married? - I had to shave my ears.<br> You can do this.<br> - Can you believe that? - I know.<br> If you do the ears, you may as well take a pass at the nose.<br> I don't want to have to lie about being married.<br> I don't either.<br> But it's their party, and it's one night.<br> We don't have to lie.<br> We won't talk.<br> If it comes up, we'll smile, we'll nod along - Ross? - Rachel?

He called the Long Island Expressway a "concrete miracle.<br>" This room.<br> This night.<br> That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Sorry.<br> Were you guys making fun of Parker? That depends, how much did you hear? He's a little enthusiastic.<br> What's wrong with that? - It's so much.<br> - Well, so what? I like him.<br> Do I make fun of the people you date? Tag, Janice, Mona.<br> No, because friends don't do that.<br> Do you want my opinion? Your collective dating record reads like a who's who of human crap! - I feel terrible.<br> - I know.<br> What was wrong with Mona? - Open it, open it, open it.<br> - Yeah, baby! So we never got to hear about your wedding.<br> - We were surprised we weren't invited.<br> - No, it was a small wedding.<br> But it was beautiful.<br> It was small, but kind of spectacular.<br> - Where did you have it? - On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.<br> And Stevie Wonder sang "Isn't She Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.<br> - Stevie's a family friend.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> That's amazing.<br> - I'd love to see pictures.<br> - Yeah, so would I.<br> You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz would forget to put film in the camera.<br> Would you excuse us for a second? - What are you doing? - What? This may be my only wedding.<br> - And I want it to be amazing.<br> - Okay.<br> - Maybe I rode in on a Harley.<br> - Ross, it has to be realistic.<br> Say, are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.<br> - No, I'm fine.<br> I'm great.<br> I'm with you.<br> - And I'm with you.<br> What a great time! Look at this plate bouncy thing.<br> What an inspired solution to man's plate-dispensing problems.<br> Oysters! Let me feed you.<br> That's not necessary.<br> - Please? - I don't eat - I won't quit until you try one.<br> - Okay, fine.<br> - Good.<br> - What're they like? I've never had one.<br> - Try one.<br> - They look too weird.<br> - What are you doing? - Going over my toast.<br> I can't wait.<br> They'll cry so hard, they'll be fighting for breath.<br> If you want to, I could just hold them down and you could just And my veil was lace, made by blind Belgian nuns.<br> - Blind? - Not at first, but it's intricate work.<br> They said even though they lost their sight, it was worth it.<br> - I bet you looked beautiful.<br> - Well, I don't know.<br> But there were some people that said I looked like a floating angel.<br> - How did you propose? - Oh, yeah, that's a great story.<br> Well, actually, I took her to the planetarium.<br> That's where we had our first date.<br> I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower.<br> - That is so sweet! - I want to hear the rest! Then Fred Astaire singing, "The Way You Look Tonight" came on the lights came down, I got on one knee and written across the dome, in the stars, were the words: "Will you marry me?" And the ring was the size of my fist.<br> Hey, Phoebe? Look I want to apologize.<br> Okay? We were being jerks.<br> - Parker's nice, I'd like to know him.<br> - You better do it now.<br> - Why? - Because I'm gonna kill him.<br> - What? - He's too excited about everything.<br> I'm all for living, but this is the Gellers' 35th anniversary.<br> Let's call a spade a spade.<br> This party stinks.<br> I'm having the worst time.<br> There was a line for the buffet, and when I got to the plates I slipped on a giant booger.<br> Are you sure it wasn't an oyster? It could've been.<br> I didn't look at it.<br> I wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out.<br> I thought he was a great guy.<br> I was so excited about him.<br> Well, hey, you should be excited about him.<br> There's nothing wrong with him.<br> - You think? - Yeah, know what? - We were all just being too negative.<br> - You're right.<br> He's just embracing life.<br> We could all stand to be more like Parker.<br> You know what? I'm like him! I'm a positive person! - Actually, you have an edge.<br> - What's that? - Oh, it's Parker! - Look, the Bunny Hop! - Oh, I love it! - You do? Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music? Come on! Okay, it's time for the toast.<br> I know normally Ross gives the toast, but this year I'll do it.<br> No, it's gonna be great.<br> Really.<br> Okay.<br> Mom, Dad, when I got married the thing that made me sure I could do it was the example you two set.<br> For that, and other things, I want to thank you.<br> I know I probably don't say it enough but I love you.<br> When I look around, I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here.<br> Nana, my beloved grandmother, who would so want to be here.<br> But she can't because she's dead.<br> As is our dog, Chi-Chi.<br> I mean, look how cute she is was.<br> Do me a favor, pass this to my parents.<br> Remember she's dead, okay? Her and Nana, gone.<br> Wow! Does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in "Terms of Endearment"? Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? I was watching a "60 Minutes" piece on orphans in Romania who have been so neglected that they were incapable of love.<br> You people are made of stone! Here's to Mom and Dad.<br> Whatever! Thank you, Monica.<br> That was interesting.<br> - Wasn't it interesting, Jack? - Why don't I remember this dog? Ross? Why don't you give us your toast now? Oh, no, Mom.<br> It's just Monica this year.<br> You're not saying anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary? No, of course.<br> Everybody? I just wanted to say on behalf of my new bride, Rachel and myself, that if if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.<br> Oh, Ross.<br> I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross' toast.<br> My God, what a fantastically well-lit hallway.<br> Can I get you something to drink, like a water and Valium? I must say, this apartment, it's there are no words.<br> - Thank God.<br> - It's a haven.<br> - A third-floor paradise, a modern Eden.<br> - Yeah, I know, I know.<br> Gotcha.<br> Listen, why don't we just sit and relax, just be with each other quietly.<br> That sounds great.<br> This is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on.<br> Let's try something.<br> Let's play a game.<br> - I love games.<br> - Shocking.<br> Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.<br> Or Jenga.<br> Let's play this one first, and remember, whoever talks first loses.<br> - I lose, now Jenga.<br> - Oh, my God.<br> - Is something wrong? - You know the word "wrong"? Everything isn't perfect or magical? Everything isn't aglow with the light of fairies? - They were just brake lights, Parker! - Excuse me for seeing good in traffic.<br> You don't have to put a good spin on everything! - I'm sorry.<br> I'm a positive person.<br> - No, I'm a positive person.<br> You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.<br> At Disneyland, getting laid! You want me to be negative? You want me to be less happy? Much less happy.<br> Fine.<br> Well, then to quote Ross, "I better be going.<br>" So long! Don't let the "best door in the world" hit you in the ass on your way out.<br> Isn't this the most incredible fight you've had in your life? We could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar.<br> It just isn't feasible.<br> But a dove placing the ring on your finger would've been no problem.<br> - It was fun being married to you.<br> - Yeah, and it was an easy 400 bucks.<br> - Okay, Ross, can I ask you something? - Yeah.<br> - That proposal at the planetarium? - I know, I know.<br> It was stupid.<br> Are you kidding? With the lilies, and the song and the stars? It was really wonderful.<br> Did you just make that up? I thought of it when we were going out.<br> That's how I imagined I would ask you to marry me.<br> Wow.<br> Well, that would've been very hard to say no to.<br> It's a good thing I didn't do it, it sounds like a very expensive wedding.<br> - Okay, good night.<br> - Good night.<br> Even if the sidecar had a windscreen to protect your hair? - I will think about it.<br> - That's all I'm asking.<br> Okay, that's it.<br> I give up.<br> At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary, you give the speech.<br> You know, I don't understand why they didn't cry.<br> - Come on.<br> - That stuff you said about true love? You were right.<br> We did learn a lot from Mom and Dad.<br> That picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.<br> And what you said about Nana? Yeah, she really would've wanted to be there.<br> And you know what? I think she was.<br> Oh, good God, Ross, how the hell do you do it?   <br>
