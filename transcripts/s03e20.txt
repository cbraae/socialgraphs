                    			You're telling me this actress person.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back? Oh, my God.<br> Is this what it's like to be you? -You're crazy about her, huh? -You have no idea.<br> When we're on stage, I get to kiss her and touch her.<br> She goes home with the director.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart.<br> Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this.<br> Dad called this morning.<br> Aunt Sylvia passed away.<br> We were all pretty shaken up about it.<br> Am I missing something? I thought death was supposed to be sad, in a way.<br> Well, Aunt Sylvia was.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>not a nice person.<br> She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.<br> And I'm sorry she died.<br> Did Dad say I get the dollhouse? -You get the dollhouse.<br> -I get the dollhouse! A house for dolls! That is so cool.<br> When I was a kid, I had a barrel.<br> You had a barrel for a dollhouse? No, just a barrel.<br> You know what? You can play with my dollhouse.<br> Really? Any time you want.<br> When I was young I wanted to play with this dollhouse.<br> But no! It was to be looked at, never played with.<br> My grandmother said the same thing to me.<br> The One With the Doll House .<br>:staz:.<br> (staz@post.<br>cz) Thanks for lunch.<br> You didn't have to walk me here.<br> That's okay.<br> No problem.<br> You realize we don't keep the women's lingerie here.<br> Yes, I realize that.<br> -Summer catalog.<br> -That's the stuff.<br> Rachel, I need the versace invoice.<br> You don't work for me.<br> Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing.<br> Joanna.<br> Bing? That's a great name.<br> It's Gaelic for, "Thy turkey's done.<br> " -I'm gonna go.<br> Nice meeting you.<br> -You too.<br> So what's wrong with him? Nothing.<br> He's just goofy like that.<br> I actually hardly notice it anymore.<br> I mean, is he married or involved with anyone? He's not married or involved with anyone.<br> Actually, you know what? Forget it.<br> -I'll ask him for you, if you want.<br> -Would you? Or is it too sad and desperate, like something Sophie would do? -I am here.<br> -I know that.<br> Look at it! Wallpaper's a little faded.<br> That's okay.<br> Carpet's a little loose.<br> Hardwood floors?! -It's so beautiful! -I know! So I'm here, ready to play! I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out.<br> What's this? That's a dog.<br> Every house should have a dog.<br> Not one that can pee on the roof.<br> Maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.<br> And is this in case the house sneezes? No, that's the ghost for the attic.<br> -I don't want a ghost.<br> -Well, nobody wants a ghost.<br> But you've got one.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>because the house is sitting on an ancient lndian burial ground.<br> Wait a minute.<br> The house was built on radioactive waste.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and an ancient lndian burial ground? That would never happen.<br> Obviously you don't know much about the U.<br>S.<br> government.<br> -I need to talk to you.<br> -Sure.<br> What's up? Oh, sorry.<br> I meant Chandler.<br> I know.<br> Well, if something comes up.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.<br> My boss.<br> Joanna.<br> When you left.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she started asking questions about you.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Liked what she saw? Dug my action, did she? Checking out the Chan Chan Man! That was.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>surreal.<br> What do you think? Are you interested? She seemed cool.<br> Attractive.<br> I'll do it.<br> Thank you, Chandler.<br> This is great.<br> She's gonna love me.<br> Dinosaur attack! Quick, everybody into the house! All right, Phoebe, you know what? That's it.<br> That's it.<br> No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not victorian and they don't go.<br> Fine.<br> Come, dinosaur.<br> We're not welcome in the house of no imagination.<br> While we're on the subject, I have to say that dinosaurs.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>they don't go, "ruff! " The little ones do.<br> -Hey, Kate.<br> -Morning.<br> I went to that restaurant you talked about-- Hey, lovely.<br> Come, talk to me for a minute.<br> I ate the food.<br> It was good.<br> I had the fish.<br> I'm Lauren.<br> Kate's understudy.<br> Joey Tribbiani.<br> I know.<br> I'm a big fan of yours.<br> What? I used to schedule my classes so I could watch Dr.<br> Drake Ramoray.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>on Days of our Lives.<br> -Get out of here.<br> Really? -Absolutely.<br> But then they dropped you down that elevator shaft.<br> They gave me the shaft, all right.<br> You're so funny.<br> What are you doing after rehearsal? You want to get a drink? Sure.<br> A drink sounds great.<br> -Cool.<br> I'll see you then.<br> -All right.<br> All right.<br> It's time to act, my talking props.<br> Look everybody! Look at my new dollhouse! Look, look! Hey, what's this? It's a slide instead of stairs.<br> Look.<br> very interesting, Phoebe.<br> What's this? The licorice room.<br> You can eat all the furniture.<br> And when guests come over, they can stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.<br> This is the coolest house ever! Does anyone want to join me in the Aroma Room? -All right.<br> -I would.<br> Hey, guys? Guys! Did you see my new china cabinet? Watch.<br> Watch.<br> And? And? Hey, my father's house does that.<br> How did it go? Tell me everything! The movie was great.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.<br> Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that because Joanna's such a dull dud! Chandler is fantastic! -What? -You know how people just click? He came by to pick me up, I opened the door and it was just like, "click! " Did he tell you? Doesn't he have a good heart? And he's so sweet.<br> He said he'd call, so put him straight through.<br> -Isn't this great? -Don't spoil it.<br> Come on, baby, don't go.<br> Please? What do you say? It's you.<br> Just one sec.<br> I'm going to take this call.<br> When I continue, I hope there will appear on-stage.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>this magical thing that in the theater we call.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>committing to the moment! The guy's like a cartoon.<br> What do you see in him, anyway? He happens to be brilliant.<br> Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.<br> I'm not interested in her sweater.<br> It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.<br> And besides.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>since when do you care who I'm with? I don't care.<br> Why, do you want me to care? Do you want me to want you to care? Do you? What? Okay.<br> I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick up where we left off.<br> Come on, baby, don't go.<br> Please? What do you say? I've got no reason to stay.<br> Stop! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.<br> I can't believe we go on in a week.<br> Hey, it's gonna be all right.<br> Since we're getting off early, do you want to go paint mugs? What? At the place I told you about last night? Yeah, with the mug-painting.<br> I was so listening to that.<br> But you know what? I need to work on my stuff tonight.<br> I'll see you tomorrow.<br> Are you okay? I guess.<br> What are we gonna do about the scene? I don't know.<br> Maybe if it had more heat.<br> Well, how do you mean? Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right? victor can't just kiss her.<br> He's gotta.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>he's gotta give her a reason.<br> Maybe he could slip her the tongue.<br> Or maybe.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>maybe he could grab her and lift her up.<br> Then Adrianne could wrap her legs around his waist.<br> Then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and stomach.<br> Then he could use his teeth to undo her dress and.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and bite her! Then right when the scene ends, he could take her.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>with this raw, animal.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> Something like that? That's pretty much what I had in mind.<br> It's a little early to be drinking.<br> Things finally happened with Kate.<br> You're kidding? That's great.<br> It was so amazing.<br> After the lovemaking.<br> .<br> .<br> Oh, my.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I just watched her sleep for hours.<br> Just breathing in.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and breathing out.<br> I knew she was dreaming because.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>her eyes kept going like this.<br> I'm telling you, she's got it all wrong.<br> All I said was, "This was fun.<br> Let's do it again sometime.<br> I'll give you a call.<br> " I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her? It's what you say at the end of a date.<br> You can't just say, "Nice to meet you.<br> Good night?" To her face? I'm standing there.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>she's waiting for me to say I'll call her.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and it comes out.<br> I can't help it.<br> It's a compulsion.<br> When a guy says he'll call, it doesn't mean he's going to call.<br> This never happened to you? Well, they always called.<br> Bite me.<br> -Did he call? -No, sorry.<br> Why? He said he'd call.<br> Why hasn't he called? Maybe he's intimidated by smart, strong, successful women.<br> Sophie, will you please climb out of my butt.<br> Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why? Maybe he feels awkward because you're my boss.<br> Awkward? Why should he feel awkward? You didn't tell him not to call me, did you? If you're uncomfortable with your friend dating me.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>there are always ways to fix that.<br> Call her.<br> Call her now! Multiple so many paper cuts.<br> "Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why, why? I don't understand! " I'm telling you, she's flipped out! She's gone crazy! Well, give me the phone then.<br> She thinks it's my fault you haven't called her.<br> You have to call her.<br> You can't call somebody after this long to say: "In case you didn't notice, I don't like you.<br> " Then you'll have to take her out again.<br> She's really dull, and she gets this.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>gross mascara-goop thing in the corner of her eye! I don't care! You'll take her out again and end it.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in a way she knows it's ended.<br> I don't care how hard it is.<br> Don't tell her you'll call her again! All right, fine! But just lunch.<br> From now on, I get my own dates.<br> I don't want you setting me up again! That's fine! -That's just a lot of big talk.<br> -I know.<br> I'm in the shower! Fire! There's a fire! Fire! I talked to Lauren.<br> I told her how things were with us.<br> Did you talk to Marshall? About what? About what happened with us.<br> No, there's really no reason why he should find out.<br> So let's not make a big deal out of it, okay? What are you talking about? It was a big deal.<br> You can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.<br> I was there.<br> You're not that good an actress.<br> I was just caught up in the moment.<br> That's all it was.<br> Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>haven't you slept with a woman and it meant more to her than to you? Hi, pig! Sorry I scared you in there.<br> It's okay.<br> By the way.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I was just checking the shower massager.<br> I tried to reach you at work.<br> There's been a fire.<br> What? Oh, my God! What happened? We believe it originated here.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>in the Aroma Room.<br> Did everyone get out okay? The giraffe's okay, and so is the pirate.<br> -What's this? -No, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there! The foster puppets! It's not a big deal.<br> It's right here, and it's all the time.<br> Thanks again for lunch.<br> -This was pleasant.<br> -It was, wasn't it? -The food there was great.<br> -Wasn't it? So take care.<br> You too.<br> I'll give you a call.<br> We should do it again! Great.<br> I'm looking forward to it.<br> -Any messages? -Sophie's desk.<br> Are you gonna call her? I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.<br> You are gonna tell her.<br> You'll tell her now.<br> I'm not gonna call you.<br> What? I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry I said I was going to when I'm not.<br> This has nothing to do with you.<br> And this isn't Rachel's fault.<br> It's me.<br> I have serious problems when it comes to women.<br> I have issues with commitment, intimacy.<br> .<br> .<br> : : :mascara goop: I'm really sorry.<br> It's just that.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>this isn't going to work out.<br> This isn't how I was hoping this would end.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.<br> I'll give you a call.<br> We should do it again sometime! Anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>I should have considered your feelings before I went home with you.<br> I've recently learned what it's like to be on your side.<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br> .<br>and I'm sorry.<br> Do you think you can forgive me? Great.<br> Thanks.<br> Hello, Jennifer? Hi, Mrs.<br> Laurio.<br> Is Jennifer there? She's not home, huh? Actually I kind of need to talk to you too.<br>   <br>
